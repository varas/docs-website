      "body": "Applications are automatically removed from New Relic after 93 days without sending data to our platform. You can also remove an application using the UI, once it has stopped sending data. Key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API, with the application name remaining reserved. For more information, see Inactive apps in New Relic One and our data retention guidelines. Before attempting to remove an app Before attempting to remove an APM, browser, or mobile app from the New Relic UI, keep in mind: You can downgrade your account to pay less or make it entirely free. To remove an app, you must have a user role with that capability. If an agent is still sending data from an app, you cannot remove an app. Remove an application from New Relic Before removing an APM, browser, or mobile application from New Relic, stop the application from sending data either by disabling the agent or by uninstalling it completely. APM applications Disable the APM agent: C SDK: Do a quick recompile and deploy. For example, surround your instrumentation in #ifdef, and set the value of YOURNAMESPACE_NEWRELIC_ENABLED with your build system. Go: Set Enabled to false. Java: Set agent_enabled to false. .NET: Set Newrelic.AgentEnabled to false. Node.js: Set agent_enabled to false. PHP: Remove or disable both the newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon components. Set newrelic.enabled to false. Python: Set monitor_mode to false. Ruby: Set agent_enabled to false. Restart the application server and wait up to ten minutes. Verify the color-coded health status for the app has turned to gray and is no longer reporting data. To remove the APM application and any browser applications linked to it, you have two options: Click the Delete application button on the APM application/service's Settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app/service) > Settings > Application. Or, call the /applications/delete endpoint of the New Relic REST API. For example: curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID.json' \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:YOUR_API_KEY' -i Copy Browser If you've used the copy/paste method to install the browser agent, remove the JavaScript snippet from your application's pages. After 93 days, the application will be removed from New Relic. Tip If browser data continues to be reported, see our suggestions below. Once your browser application has stopped reporting, you have two ways to remove it: If your browser application is linked to an APM application, deleting the APM application also removes the browser application. See the instructions for deleting an APM application/service above for details. Or, click the Delete application button on the browser application's Application settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings . Mobile Remove all references/dependencies to the New Relic's mobile SDK/frameworks, then rebuild the application. For more information, see the iOS and Android install docs. After 93 days, the application will be removed from New Relic. Or, once your mobile application has stopped reporting, you can also remove it manually: Click the Delete application button on the mobile application's Settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Application . Troubleshooting If you have problems removing an app, here are some possible causes and suggested solutions: You are not an admin on your full user account If you don't have proper permissions, you won't be able to remove an application. You have not waited long enough All app data must stop reporting to New Relic before you can remove that entity from New Relic. In most cases, this takes between 10-15 minutes. In rare cases, it can take a few minutes longer. Not all agents are disabled If you have multiple agents reporting data under the same UI name, then you must make sure you disable or uninstall all of the agents associated with that entity. You have problems removing your PHP app If you have a PHP app and aren't able to remove it from the UI, possible causes include: You have not disabled both components of the PHP agent. You must stop or uninstall both newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon in order to be able to remove a PHP app. For more information, see New Relic daemon processes. You have set up per-directory monitoring of your PHP app, and unexpected PHP data is reporting as the default PHP application in the New Relic UI. To fix this, change the default app name in the PHP agent config. You don't know where the app's data is coming from If you don't know where an app's data is coming from, it may be because the app's name has been changed. When an app name is changed in the UI, it does not change the underlying app name being reported; it only changes how the app name appears in the UI. To see if there is a difference between the reported name and the displayed name: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. Scroll down to Settings and select Application. Compare the name in the Application alias field to the name in the Your application still reports as message directly beneath it. To get host information about an app you are not familiar with: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. From the summary view, review the Servers list. Once you have identified where app data is coming from, you can remove the app from New Relic. Browser data is still reporting To remove an app from New Relic, all data must have stopped reporting, including browser monitoring data. To verify that you have disabled or uninstalled the APM agent associated with the app: Ensure that browser monitoring is disabled. If your browser monitoring script is inserted by the APM agent, turn it off from inside the UI, in the agent's config file, or in both. If you copied and pasted the monitoring JavaScript snippet in certain pages, remove that JavaScript snippet manually. Ensure all caches have been cleared that the application uses, such as host caches, CDNs, or anything else that caches built pages. Optional: To see a count of how many page views report from each domain, use this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView WHERE appName = 'YOUR_BROWSER_APP_NAME' FACET domain Copy If these steps don't resolve the issue, it is likely due to an end-user's browser cache that hasn't yet cleared. Wait until those caches clear. If your app has internal users, you may be able to identify the users and clear those caches. For more help",

      "body": "Our APM agents and mobile agents have limits on the number of events that can be reported. This document explains: Why event-reporting limits are necessary How sampling works How to work with and understand sampled data Difference between events and metrics This document is about limits on event data and how those limits lead to sampling. First, it may help you to understand the differences between these two types of data: Metrics: aggregated measurements over time. Examples: average response time over a one-minute time range, throughput over time, CPU utilization over time. Events: discrete events that happen at a specific moment in time. Examples: a log or error being reported, or a configuration change. Some events are aggregated over time to form metrics (for example: a count of errors over time). These two types of data have different uses: metrics are useful for recognizing patterns over time in your system, and events are useful for drilling down and getting detail about the causes of those patterns. Because metrics are aggregated over time, they’re useful for spotting trends and changes in system behavior. For metrics that represent an aggregated count of events (like an HTTP response time metric), the individual events give you granular detail about what happened, and let you facet by attributes that have high cardinality (like account or user ID). Why sampling of events is necessary Our APM agents and mobile agents have limits on how many events can be reported per harvest cycle. This is necessary because if there were no limit, a very large number of events being sent could have performance impacts on your application or on New Relic. When the limit is reached, the agents begin sampling events. Different agents have different limits, but the goal is to give a representative sample from across the harvest cycle. Also, agents may sample if they can't connect to New Relic. When an agent can’t connect to New Relic, it continues to store data locally. But it must restrict the size of the payload that is eventually sent. For this reason, it samples events during the disconnected period. The longer it is disconnected, the more it will sample. The impact of sampling One result of sampling is that there can be a discrepancy between unsampled metric data and sampled event data. Examples of this: An APM chart showing unsampled metric data may show you higher throughput than an equivalent NRQL query of sampled event data. For more about the difference between our metric timeslice data and event data, see Data types. A non-New Relic monitoring service may show different results from New Relic. Events that are capped and subject to sampling include: Transaction TransactionError Span (see Distributed tracing sampling) Custom events reported via agent API (example: the .NET agent's RecordCustomEvent) Mobile MobileRequest MobileCrash MobileHandledException Important For APM, you can compensate for sampling when querying data. Change how sampling occurs Before attempting to change how sampling occurs, please read these caveats and recommendations: Reporting more events will result in the agent using more memory. There will usually be a way for you to get the data you need without raising an agent's event-reporting limit. The payload size limit is 1MB (10^6 bytes) (compressed), so the number of events may still be affected by that limit. To determine if events are being dropped, see the agent log for a 413 HTTP status message. Here are some ways to impact sampling: Most agents have configuration options for changing the limit on sampled transactions (examples: Java agent’s max_samples_stored or the Android mobile agent’s setMaxEventPoolSize). If it’s important to you that a specific app activity not be sampled, you can use the Event API. You could deploy your application across a greater number of instances. Because the limits are per-agent, more agents will mean a larger event reservoir. APM: Compensate for sampling When querying APM-reported events, you can compensate for sampling by using EXTRAPOLATE. This will give you an approximation of what unsampled data looks like.",

SLA tips Comments Requirements When using the cURL command examples, be sure to replace the placeholder text with your account ID, an API key, and the application ID. Time ranges You are not limited to standard day, week, or month time ranges. For example, you can extract metric data for a \"holiday weekend\" from 12/23 to 12/26 or \"the 20 minutes after our site had problems\" or whatever other period interests you. UTC XML time format You must specify the time in UTC XML format, so be sure to adjust for your time zone compared to UTC. For example, New Relic starts at 16:00:00 on the day before the selected data, since New Relic headquarters are in UTC-8. Summary reports When requesting metrics to use with summary reports, include the query string parameter summarize=true (v2) or summary=1 (v1) as shown in the examples. Scaled statistics Your report has some statistics that are scaled in the SLA reports in New Relic's user interface. New Relic changes the scale of page views in your report to show small numbers. Depending on your traffic, typically it might be displayed in thousands, millions, or billions. Recommendation: To avoid a string of zeroes, divide this number appropriately for your own purposes. End user statistics End user statistics will reflect only the calls in which New Relic Browser data was gathered. For example, end user stats may not appear in situations such as: Browsers types Clients (they might have disabled the JavaScript agent, or blocked traffic to New Relic sites for JavaScript code's location Transactions not in one of those categories, in case the page load did not complete for any reason This is why there are fewer (sometimes many fewer) page views in the End User (Browser) data section than in the App server data section. Examples The following sections contain code examples to acquire the data for values described above for the Daily (24hr) SLA statistics in the default GMT/UTC time zone. Adjust the from= and to= for your time range as desired. There are syntactical differences between New Relic's REST API v2 and v1. The examples show how to use each.

Agent versions and protocols Make sure you meet these requirements for your agent's version, protocols, interfaces, or message queue libraries. If you are using a protocol that is not listed here, you will not see a connection between your applications. Agent version Notes C SDK Use distributed tracing. Go 1.11 or higher HTTP, HTTPS Java 3.9.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPs, JMS 1.1, RabbitMQ The Java agent also supports several message queue libraries, including those that use the JMS 1.1 interface. .NET 4.2 or higher HTTP, and supported .NET messaging systems Node.js 2.0.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, RabbitMQ PHP 4.19.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, and supported PHP message queuing systems Python 2.38.0.31 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, and supported Python message queuing systems Ruby 4.3.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, RabbitMQ Config file requirements In general, New Relic's cross application tracing feature is enabled by default. Requirements to change your configuration file vary, depending on your New Relic agent: C SDK (not supported) Go (not supported) Java .NET Node.js (no specific config file settings needed for Node.js) PHP Python Ruby High throughput apps Cross application traces rely on transaction events to associate related transactions. If you have a high throughput application, your agent may reach the maximum number of events that it can record in a minute and will fall back to sampling events. If a transaction’s events are sampled, you may see an incomplete cross application trace, including sometimes only the transactions that you are focused on. If your application has high throughput, some cross application traces will appear incomplete, sometimes with no links. Try viewing a different transaction trace. To reduce or eliminate sampling, you can also adjust the number of transaction events stored in your agent configuration. High throughput apps Troubleshooting tips Java From the transaction_events stanza, adjust the setting for max_samples_stored. Ruby Adjust the setting for analytics_events.max_samples_stored. Proxies If you expect to see a cross application trace link but it consistently does not appear, there may be a proxy or broker between your application’s communication. Cross application tracing relies on HTTP headers and JMS properties being passed from one application to other. HTTP proxies and message brokers sometimes strip those headers. Multi-threaded processing (Java) If one or more of your Java applications uses an async or \"reactive\" programming model, a transaction's activity may span across multiple threads. New Relic supports the Play framework and Servlet Async but not all async frameworks. For unsupported frameworks, activity on other threads is not reported as part of the transaction. Calls to other applications will not be traced. Sub-accounts Currently cross application traces do not cross New Relic accounts. If you have multiple New Relic accounts (including sub-accounts), you will only see traces for applications within one account.",

      "body": "The word transaction can have several different meanings in the software industry. This document explains how the term is used by New Relic and how transactions are reported. What is a transaction? At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a web transaction, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent. When you install APM in a supported system, it begins automatically reporting web requests and other important functions and methods. To supplement the default level of monitoring, you can set up custom instrumentation to report additional transactions. Some frameworks do not have a natural concept of a transaction. In other words, there are no predefined pathways that can easily be recognized or monitored as transactions. To define transactions in such frameworks, you can use custom instrumentation. Types of transactions Cumulative transaction data appears in APM on the Transactions page. The two main categories of transactions are web and non-web: Web: Transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. Non-web: Non-web transactions are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks. Transaction segments The individual functions and calls that make up a transaction are called segments. For example external service calls and database calls are segments, and both have their own UI pages in APM. The APM Transactions page displays aggregate transaction segment data. To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To see the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names. To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use custom instrumentation. Monitoring transactions Here are some other ways you can use APM to monitor transactions: If you want to monitor... Use this... Transactions important to your business Create key transactions, which emphasizes them in the UI and lets you set a custom level of monitoring for them. Async activity Follow the procedures to set up asynchronous activity for your specific APM language agent. Activity across applications Linking transactions across applications gives you more detail about business-relevant application activity. For more information, see the documentation about distributed tracing and cross application traces. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Query transactions Transactions are available for querying with an in-depth set of default attributes attached. Using these attributes, you can run queries and create custom charts that APM does not provide by default. For information on how to query your data using our UI or NRQL, see Query New Relic data.",

      "body": "The Ruby agent automatically instruments Rack middlewares. If you are unfamiliar with the basics of Rack middlewares, review the resources linked by the Rails on Rack guide. Additionally, the Ruby agent provides some features via Rack middlewares: Cross application traces Auto-instrumentation for Browser monitoring New Relic automatically installs these middlewares for Rails and Sinatra. Rack instrumentation The two most common ways to configure Rack middlewares are the Rack::Builder API (most often from config.ru) and Rails' middleware stack configuration: Rack::Builder Middlewares in your config.ru file are configured using Rack::Builder. For the Ruby agent to instrument middlewares from Rack::Builder, your app must run version 1.1.0 or higher of the rack gem. This is the most common use of middlewares with Sinatra or pure-rack applications. Rails middlewares Rails uses its own class (ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack) instead of Rack::Builder to configure middlewares. Even if you haven't explicitly added middlewares to your Rails application, many components of Rails itself are implemented as middleware, so middleware data will appear by default. The Ruby agent automatically instruments middlewares added via ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack on Rails 3.0 or higher. For more information about configuring middlewares with Rails, see the Ruby on Rails guide. Viewing middleware data You can view middleware data in APM. In the APM Summary page The main chart on your app's APM Summary page includes a purple bar that shows average time per request spent in all Rack middlewares for your application. APM > (selected application) > Summary: Middleware time appears in purple on your app's main Overview chart. In the APM Transactions page You can also see time for individual middlewares for a specific transaction name from your app's APM Transactions page. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction) > Trace details: Here is an example of middleware time for a selected transaction for your app. In APM transaction trace summary Transaction traces also capture detailed middleware call information. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction trace): Here is an example of middleware details in a transaction trace. Disabling Rack instrumentation If you do not want to instrument Rack middlewares, you may disable Rack middleware instrumentation with the disable_middleware_instrumentation setting. You can also ignore specific transactions. Installing Ruby agent middlewares manually The Ruby agent's implementation of New Relic's Cross Application Tracing feature uses Rack middleware instrumentation to read and write HTTP headers that are necessary to pass information between monitored applications. If you have disabled middleware instrumentation as described above and want to use cross application tracing, you must manually add the NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks middleware to your middleware stack. For more information, see Cross application tracing in Ruby. Manual Rack instrumentation Earlier versions of the Ruby agent supported manually instrumenting Rack middlewares via the NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::Rack module. This instrumentation is deprecated in Ruby agent versions 3.9.0 or higher, because it is unnecessary with automatic middleware instrumentation. New Relic recommends that you remove references to this module from your code after upgrading to 3.9.0 or higher.",

      "body": "New Relic APM's cross application tracing lets you link transactions between your APM-monitored applications. What is cross application tracing? Important Instead of using cross application tracing, we recommend our distributed tracing features. Distributed tracing is an improvement on the cross application tracing feature and is recommended for large, distributed systems. New Relic APM's cross application traces link transactions between APM apps in your service-oriented architecture (SOA). This is useful, for example, to identify performance problems between your own application (the \"calling\" app) and any internal or external services (the \"called\" app), such as traffic to internal services. This helps you to: Spot bottlenecks in your cross application call flows. Understand from end to end how specific transactions are used by other applications and services. Diagnose problems faster and enhance collaboration across teams. Security considerations Cross application tracing relies on three HTTP headers in order to exchange information between the calling and called applications. The first two (X-NewRelic-ID and X-NewRelic-Transaction) appear as HTTP request headers in outgoing requests sent by an instrumented application. The remaining header (X-NewRelic-App-Data) is inserted into the HTTP response if the called application belongs to the same New Relic account as the calling application. New Relic obfuscates all of these headers using an obfuscation scheme identical to what is used for New Relic Browser's configuration for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) but with a different key. HTTP header Description X-NewRelic-ID (in request header) Contains the account ID and application ID of the application making the call X-NewRelic-Transaction (in request header) Contains information about an individual transaction created by the call (a GUID unique to the calling transaction, along with information about upstream calls that spawned the transaction) X-NewRelic-App-Data (in the response if applicable) Contains information about the called application, including: Account ID Application ID Name of the called transaction Timing information for the called transaction GUID of the called transaction",

      "body": "The word transaction can have several different meanings in the software industry. This document explains how the term is used by New Relic and how transactions are reported. What is a transaction? At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a web transaction, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent. When you install APM in a supported system, it begins automatically reporting web requests and other important functions and methods. To supplement the default level of monitoring, you can set up custom instrumentation to report additional transactions. Some frameworks do not have a natural concept of a transaction. In other words, there are no predefined pathways that can easily be recognized or monitored as transactions. To define transactions in such frameworks, you can use custom instrumentation. Types of transactions Cumulative transaction data appears in APM on the Transactions page. The two main categories of transactions are web and non-web: Web: Transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. Non-web: Non-web transactions are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks. Transaction segments The individual functions and calls that make up a transaction are called segments. For example external service calls and database calls are segments, and both have their own UI pages in APM. The APM Transactions page displays aggregate transaction segment data. To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To see the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names. To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use custom instrumentation. Monitoring transactions Here are some other ways you can use APM to monitor transactions: If you want to monitor... Use this... Transactions important to your business Create key transactions, which emphasizes them in the UI and lets you set a custom level of monitoring for them. Async activity Follow the procedures to set up asynchronous activity for your specific APM language agent. Activity across applications Linking transactions across applications gives you more detail about business-relevant application activity. For more information, see the documentation about distributed tracing and cross application traces. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Query transactions Transactions are available for querying with an in-depth set of default attributes attached. Using these attributes, you can run queries and create custom charts that APM does not provide by default. For information on how to query your data using our UI or NRQL, see Query New Relic data.",

      "body": "The Ruby agent automatically instruments Rack middlewares. If you are unfamiliar with the basics of Rack middlewares, review the resources linked by the Rails on Rack guide. Additionally, the Ruby agent provides some features via Rack middlewares: Cross application traces Auto-instrumentation for Browser monitoring New Relic automatically installs these middlewares for Rails and Sinatra. Rack instrumentation The two most common ways to configure Rack middlewares are the Rack::Builder API (most often from config.ru) and Rails' middleware stack configuration: Rack::Builder Middlewares in your config.ru file are configured using Rack::Builder. For the Ruby agent to instrument middlewares from Rack::Builder, your app must run version 1.1.0 or higher of the rack gem. This is the most common use of middlewares with Sinatra or pure-rack applications. Rails middlewares Rails uses its own class (ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack) instead of Rack::Builder to configure middlewares. Even if you haven't explicitly added middlewares to your Rails application, many components of Rails itself are implemented as middleware, so middleware data will appear by default. The Ruby agent automatically instruments middlewares added via ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack on Rails 3.0 or higher. For more information about configuring middlewares with Rails, see the Ruby on Rails guide. Viewing middleware data You can view middleware data in APM. In the APM Summary page The main chart on your app's APM Summary page includes a purple bar that shows average time per request spent in all Rack middlewares for your application. APM > (selected application) > Summary: Middleware time appears in purple on your app's main Overview chart. In the APM Transactions page You can also see time for individual middlewares for a specific transaction name from your app's APM Transactions page. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction) > Trace details: Here is an example of middleware time for a selected transaction for your app. In APM transaction trace summary Transaction traces also capture detailed middleware call information. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction trace): Here is an example of middleware details in a transaction trace. Disabling Rack instrumentation If you do not want to instrument Rack middlewares, you may disable Rack middleware instrumentation with the disable_middleware_instrumentation setting. You can also ignore specific transactions. Installing Ruby agent middlewares manually The Ruby agent's implementation of New Relic's Cross Application Tracing feature uses Rack middleware instrumentation to read and write HTTP headers that are necessary to pass information between monitored applications. If you have disabled middleware instrumentation as described above and want to use cross application tracing, you must manually add the NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks middleware to your middleware stack. For more information, see Cross application tracing in Ruby. Manual Rack instrumentation Earlier versions of the Ruby agent supported manually instrumenting Rack middlewares via the NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::Rack module. This instrumentation is deprecated in Ruby agent versions 3.9.0 or higher, because it is unnecessary with automatic middleware instrumentation. New Relic recommends that you remove references to this module from your code after upgrading to 3.9.0 or higher.",

      "body": "In APM, a transaction trace gives a detailed snapshot of a single transaction in your application. A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working. What transactions record traces In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a transaction. Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces: Over the minute-long harvest cycle, all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your Apdex T value or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions. At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it. These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example: The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions. If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling. If you don't see traces in your account, it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust transaction trace settings to ensure some transactions will be traced. If you use Synthetic, you will likely have Synthetic monitor traces. Synthetic traces can happen more frequently than APM traces, potentially several per minute. Configure transaction traces To configure or edit trace settings, see the procedures for: Transaction traces Key transaction traces View transaction traces in UI To view transaction traces: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. In the Transaction traces section, click transaction traces to view additional details.

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, New Relic APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The New Relic APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

      "body": "This document explains what non-web transactions are in APM, and how you can instrument background tasks and other arbitrary activity to be reported as non-web transactions. What are non-web transactions? The two main New Relic APM transaction categories are web and non-web. Web transactions are transactions we detect as being initiated by a web request; they are the most common type of transaction reported by APM. Non-web transactions are transactions that are not web transactions; we do not detect they were initiated by a web request. This includes processes and jobs that do not handle web requests, such as message processing and background tasks. For example, you might schedule something to run periodically on your server to do database work, send emails, etc. The source is not a web request but something on your server. Some non-web transactions from supported frameworks or services are detected automatically by New Relic; others may be created using custom instrumentation. We intentionally separate your web and non-web transactions in the UI. Non-web vs. web transactions Comments Less directly important Non-web transactions are often background processes and tasks, and they are less directly important to your application's users when compared to web transactions. Long running Non-web transactions are often long-running processes. Separating them from web transactions prevents those results from skewing your customer-facing response times. Omitted from Apdex score Combining your non-web transactions with your web transactions would hurt your Apdex score (a measure of satisfaction with load times). This is why Apdex data for non-web transactions does not appear in the UI. Create non-web transactions To create new non-web transactions, follow the procedures for your APM language agent. C SDK Follow the procedures for instrumenting a non-web transaction. Go Follow the procedures for instrumenting a non-web transaction. Java Follow the procedures for instrumenting a transaction (instrumenting a transaction without web request parameters creates a non-web transaction). .NET By default, the APM .NET agent instruments IIS ASP workers. To instrument other (non-IIS) .NET applications, such as standalone (WCF) services, console apps, and other Windows services, see Instrumenting custom applications and Instrumenting WCF applications. Important For IIS applications, you cannot change web transactions to non-web transactions. Node.js Use startBackgroundTransaction(). PHP To mark a transaction as non-web: use newrelic_background_job and set the flag to true. The PHP agent reports all command-line run scripts as non-web transactions. Python See Python agent non-web transactions. The Python agent also supports non-web transaction reporting from Celery and Gearman. Ruby See Ruby agent non-web transactions. View non-web transactions To view non-web transaction data in the New Relic UI, go to the main chart on the following pages, and then select the Non-web option in the dropdown: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Summary. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. Transactions: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions.",

      "body": "In APM, a transaction trace gives a detailed snapshot of a single transaction in your application. A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working. What transactions record traces In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a transaction. Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces: Over the minute-long harvest cycle, all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your Apdex T value or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions. At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it. These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example: The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions. If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling. If you don't see traces in your account, it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust transaction trace settings to ensure some transactions will be traced. If you use Synthetic, you will likely have Synthetic monitor traces. Synthetic traces can happen more frequently than APM traces, potentially several per minute. Configure transaction traces To configure or edit trace settings, see the procedures for: Transaction traces Key transaction traces View transaction traces in UI To view transaction traces: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. In the Transaction traces section, click transaction traces to view additional details. Troubleshoot an issue with transaction traces If you expect to see transaction traces but do not see them, follow the troubleshooting procedures.

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, New Relic APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The New Relic APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

For the PHP, Node.js, and Go agents, only web transactions can be turned into key transactions. What are key transactions? In New Relic APM, making a transaction a key transaction gives you the following benefits: Key transactions are grouped together in the New Relic UI, so they are easy to find and examine. You can set a custom Apdex threshold for a key transaction. You can set an alert policy for a key transaction. Key transactions are useful for: Important transactions. For your app's most important transactions, making them key transactions means you can quickly find and examine them. You can set stricter Apdex requirements for them, and you can create alert policies for them. Slow transactions. If a transaction is regularly slower than other transactions, it can bring down the Apdex score of the entire application. When you make a transaction a key transaction, you can set a longer-duration Apdex threshold for it so it won't bring down your app's Apdex score.

For the PHP, Node.js, and Go agents, only web transactions can be turned into key transactions. What are key transactions? In New Relic APM, making a transaction a key transaction gives you the following benefits: Key transactions are grouped together in the New Relic UI, so they are easy to find and examine. You can set a custom Apdex threshold for a key transaction. You can set an alert policy for a key transaction. Key transactions are useful for: Important transactions. For your app's most important transactions, making them key transactions means you can quickly find and examine them. You can set stricter Apdex requirements for them, and you can create alert policies for them. Slow transactions. If a transaction is regularly slower than other transactions, it can bring down the Apdex score of the entire application. When you make a transaction a key transaction, you can set a longer-duration Apdex threshold for it so it won't bring down your app's Apdex score. Create key transactions To create key transactions, see Create and update key transactions. View key transactions in UI The key transaction's page includes response time and throughput charts, service-level agreement information, a cross application tracing map (if available), and links to alert policy options.

      "body": "In APM, a transaction trace gives a detailed snapshot of a single transaction in your application. A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working. What transactions record traces In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a transaction. Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces: Over the minute-long harvest cycle, all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your Apdex T value or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions. At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it. These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example: The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions. If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling. If you don't see traces in your account, it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust transaction trace settings to ensure some transactions will be traced. If you use Synthetic, you will likely have Synthetic monitor traces. Synthetic traces can happen more frequently than APM traces, potentially several per minute. Configure transaction traces To configure or edit trace settings, see the procedures for: Transaction traces Key transaction traces View transaction traces in UI To view transaction traces: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. In the Transaction traces section, click transaction traces to view additional details. Troubleshoot an issue with transaction traces If you expect to see transaction traces but do not see them, follow the troubleshooting procedures.

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, New Relic APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The New Relic APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

Database overhead Look at the structure of your queries to see if there are opportunities to combine different types of information into a single call; for example, querying for the account ID, name, etc. This is useful, for example, if your database center is in a different geographical location, because this will reduce overhead. The amount of time for your database request and response may be very fast. However, by combining requests into fewer calls, you can reduce that time even more.

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, New Relic APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The New Relic APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

Configure transaction trace settings via agent You can customize your transaction trace settings via New Relic agent configuration files and other \"local\" configuration methods such as environment variables. For more information about transaction trace configuration options, see the specific New Relic language agent's documentation: C SDK Go Java .NET Node PHP Python Ruby Configure transaction traces using server-side configuration The ability to configure transaction traces using server-side configuration depends on the New Relic agent. If server-side configuration is not supported, the transaction trace settings will be visible in the UI but not editable. If server-side configuration settings are available for your New Relic agent, you can see them at the following: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Transaction trace settings available using server-side configuration will differ depending on the New Relic agent you use. The UI includes descriptions of each. Settings in the UI may include: Transaction tracing and threshold Record SQL, including recording level and input fields Log SQL and stack trace threshold SQL query plans and threshold Error collection, including HTTP code and error class Slow query tracing Thread profiler Cross application tracing Configure traces for specific (key) transactions If you want to monitor or alert on a transaction differently than other transactions, make it a key transaction. This is useful, for example, when you want to set a transaction-specific Apdex that is different from your general Apdex T threshold. Changing a key transaction's Apdex changes the likelihood that it creates a transaction trace. For example: If you want to make it more likely a key transaction would generate transaction traces, lower its Apdex T value. If you want to make a key transaction less likely to be traced, raise its Apdex T value. Important If you have the transaction trace threshold set to a number of seconds, and not to the default Apdex setting, the number-of-seconds threshold will act as the threshold for all transactions, even for key transactions that have custom Apdex settings. Create custom transactions You can create custom transactions for app activity that isn't being automatically captured as a transaction by the New Relic agent. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. Collect HTTP request attributes, parameters For data security reasons, transaction traces do not collect potentially sensitive HTTP request attributes, sometimes called parameters. Traces do collect some basic HTTP request attributes, which New Relic calls agent attributes. To edit attribute collection settings, see the specific New Relic agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js (does not allow HTTP attribute configuration) PHP Python Ruby For more information, see Collect custom attributes. Delete a transaction trace When you delete a transaction trace, it is deleted permanently. Delete a single transaction trace To delete a transaction trace record permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Under Transaction traces click on the trace you want to delete. On the details page, select Delete this trace. Delete all transaction traces To delete all traces for the selected app permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Click Delete all traces. It may take fifteen minutes or more for all transaction trace records to disappear from the UI. To delete all traces for your account, contact us at support.newrelic.com. Tip If you are doing general record cleanup, you may also want to delete databases and slow query traces or error traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "In APM, a transaction trace gives a detailed snapshot of a single transaction in your application. A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working. What transactions record traces In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a transaction. Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces: Over the minute-long harvest cycle, all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your Apdex T value or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions. At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it. These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example: The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions. If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling. If you don't see traces in your account, it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust transaction trace settings to ensure some transactions will be traced. If you use Synthetic, you will likely have Synthetic monitor traces. Synthetic traces can happen more frequently than APM traces, potentially several per minute. Configure transaction traces To configure or edit trace settings, see the procedures for: Transaction traces Key transaction traces View transaction traces in UI To view transaction traces: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions.

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, New Relic APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The New Relic APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

Common database query setting changes include: Collecting raw query data instead of obfuscated or turning off query collection Changing the stack trace threshold Turning on query explain plan collection Use database queries to improve performance Here are some tips to improve your app's database performance: Use database queries Comments Time Look for queries where the TOTAL DURATION contributes large amounts of time to the overall transaction time. This indicates a good place to try to enhance your database query with an index or some other optimization. Duplicate queries Look for queries that repeatedly query the same kind of information; for example, multiple queries to look up individual account IDs. Try rewriting the query to INCLUDE the specific values (account IDs 1, 2, 10, 14, 17, etc.) so that a single query can get all the relevant items. Database overhead Look at the structure of your queries to see if there are opportunities to combine different types of information into a single call; for example, querying for the account ID, name, etc. This is useful, for example, if your database center is in a different geographical location, because this will reduce overhead. The amount of time for your database request and response may be very fast. However, by combining requests into fewer calls, you can reduce that time even more. MySQL From your app's main APM Summary page, compare the database time on the main chart to other processing time. Sudden spikes or larger amounts of database time compared to other processing times may indicate problems. Find other slow queries The Trace details page is useful for examining a specific transaction's details. To see all of your application's slowest queries in one place, use the Slow queries feature.",

      "body": "In APM, a transaction trace gives a detailed snapshot of a single transaction in your application. A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working. What transactions record traces In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a transaction. Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces: Over the minute-long harvest cycle, all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your Apdex T value or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions. At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it. These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example: The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions. If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling. If you don't see traces in your account, it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust transaction trace settings to ensure some transactions will be traced. If you use Synthetic, you will likely have Synthetic monitor traces. Synthetic traces can happen more frequently than APM traces, potentially several per minute. Configure transaction traces To configure or edit trace settings, see the procedures for: Transaction traces Key transaction traces View transaction traces in UI To view transaction traces: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. In the Transaction traces section, click transaction traces to view additional details.

Configure transaction trace settings via agent You can customize your transaction trace settings via New Relic agent configuration files and other \"local\" configuration methods such as environment variables. For more information about transaction trace configuration options, see the specific New Relic language agent's documentation: C SDK Go Java .NET Node PHP Python Ruby Configure transaction traces using server-side configuration The ability to configure transaction traces using server-side configuration depends on the New Relic agent. If server-side configuration is not supported, the transaction trace settings will be visible in the UI but not editable. If server-side configuration settings are available for your New Relic agent, you can see them at the following: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Transaction trace settings available using server-side configuration will differ depending on the New Relic agent you use. The UI includes descriptions of each. Settings in the UI may include: Transaction tracing and threshold Record SQL, including recording level and input fields Log SQL and stack trace threshold SQL query plans and threshold Error collection, including HTTP code and error class Slow query tracing Thread profiler Cross application tracing Configure traces for specific (key) transactions If you want to monitor or alert on a transaction differently than other transactions, make it a key transaction. This is useful, for example, when you want to set a transaction-specific Apdex that is different from your general Apdex T threshold. Changing a key transaction's Apdex changes the likelihood that it creates a transaction trace. For example: If you want to make it more likely a key transaction would generate transaction traces, lower its Apdex T value. If you want to make a key transaction less likely to be traced, raise its Apdex T value. Important If you have the transaction trace threshold set to a number of seconds, and not to the default Apdex setting, the number-of-seconds threshold will act as the threshold for all transactions, even for key transactions that have custom Apdex settings. Create custom transactions You can create custom transactions for app activity that isn't being automatically captured as a transaction by the New Relic agent. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. Collect HTTP request attributes, parameters For data security reasons, transaction traces do not collect potentially sensitive HTTP request attributes, sometimes called parameters. Traces do collect some basic HTTP request attributes, which New Relic calls agent attributes. To edit attribute collection settings, see the specific New Relic agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js (does not allow HTTP attribute configuration) PHP Python Ruby For more information, see Collect custom attributes. Delete a transaction trace When you delete a transaction trace, it is deleted permanently. Delete a single transaction trace To delete a transaction trace record permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Under Transaction traces click on the trace you want to delete. On the details page, select Delete this trace. Delete all transaction traces To delete all traces for the selected app permanently: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Click Delete all traces. It may take fifteen minutes or more for all transaction trace records to disappear from the UI. To delete all traces for your account, contact us at support.newrelic.com. Tip If you are doing general record cleanup, you may also want to delete databases and slow query traces or error traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "In APM, a transaction trace gives a detailed snapshot of a single transaction in your application. A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working. What transactions record traces In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a transaction. Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces: Over the minute-long harvest cycle, all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your Apdex T value or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions. At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it. These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example: The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions. If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling. If you don't see traces in your account, it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust transaction trace settings to ensure some transactions will be traced. If you use Synthetic, you will likely have Synthetic monitor traces. Synthetic traces can happen more frequently than APM traces, potentially several per minute. Configure transaction traces To configure or edit trace settings, see the procedures for: Transaction traces Key transaction traces View transaction traces in UI To view transaction traces: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. In the Transaction traces section, click transaction traces to view additional details. Troubleshoot an issue with transaction traces If you expect to see transaction traces but do not see them, follow the troubleshooting procedures.

      "body": "In APM, the Trace details tab shows the timing of individual segments in a transaction trace. This document describes the sections and features of the Trace details tab. Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, New Relic APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The New Relic APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

The amount of time for your database request and response may be very fast. However, by combining requests into fewer calls, you can reduce that time even more.

Because they collect detailed data from your app, transaction traces can be a potential security concern. This document explains how to configure transaction traces for your data security needs. Database queries The database query types collected by transaction traces vary by New Relic language agent. Query collection is a potential security and/or privacy concern because queries can contain sensitive values. You can customize database query collection with three different security settings: Obfuscated: This is the default value. This setting strips string literals and numeric sequences from your queries and replaces them with the ? character. For example: the query select * from table where ssn='123-45-6789' would become select * from table where ssn=?. Off: Query collection is turned off entirely. Raw: If you are confident that full query data collection will not impact your data security or your users' privacy, you can change the setting to Raw, which will record all query values. You can edit database query collection with the Record SQL setting, explained in Configure transaction traces. HTTP request attributes and parameters The collection of HTTP request data can expose potentially sensitive data. New Relic calls the key/value data collected during an HTTP request attributes. By default, the collection of attributes is limited to only basic HTTP information that is not a source of sensitive data (for example, response code and host); these are part of the group of basic attributes that New Relic refers to as agent attributes. For data security reasons, the collection of other attributes, including user-specific parameters, is disabled by default. For information on how to enable/disable the collection of specific HTTP attributes and custom attributes, see Configure transaction traces. High security mode New Relic's default settings provide a high level of security. To force the most secure settings for all the applications in your account, you can use the high security mode. This mode ensures that, no matter how your admins and users configure your account, the most secure settings are forced and cannot be overridden. For more information, see High security mode.",

      "body": "In APM, a transaction trace gives a detailed snapshot of a single transaction in your application. A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working. What transactions record traces In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a transaction. Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces: Over the minute-long harvest cycle, all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your Apdex T value or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions. At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it. These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example: The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions. If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling. If you don't see traces in your account, it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust transaction trace settings to ensure some transactions will be traced. If you use Synthetic, you will likely have Synthetic monitor traces. Synthetic traces can happen more frequently than APM traces, potentially several per minute. Configure transaction traces To configure or edit trace settings, see the procedures for: Transaction traces Key transaction traces View transaction traces in UI To view transaction traces: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. In the Transaction traces section, click transaction traces to view additional details. Troubleshoot an issue with transaction traces If you expect to see transaction traces but do not see them, follow the troubleshooting procedures.

Trace details page functions Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details. The Trace details page displays a table with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions: Trace details page Description Primary trace data, functions The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a partial trace. Available functions include: Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved. Track as key transaction. Duration column The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are color-coded. Segment column The Segment column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be automatically grouped together. Sometimes you may see Application code as the name of a segment or subsegment. To expand segments, use either of the following: The Expand performance problems button at the top of the page The expand and collapse dropdown arrows next to the segments Drilldown column The Drilldown column may contain icons that link to additional transaction data, if available. Timestamp column The Timestamp column displays the start time of a segment or subsegment, relative to the start of the transaction. For example, a value of 3.150 s indicates that that segment started 3.15 seconds into the transaction. Drilldown options In the Drilldown column, icons indicate that additional data is available: Icon Description Database queries The database icon links to the raw database query for that query segment. Depending on your transaction trace settings, this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data. If the total time for the segment exceeds the query plan threshold in your settings, the query analysis also will appear, along with a stack trace showing the exact location of the call in your code. Stack traces The magnifying glass links to stack trace details. Aggregate transaction details This icon indicates that cross application tracing details are not available. However, you can select this icon to view aggregated transaction information across multiple invocations of the transaction. Color coding of segment duration data The Duration column of the Trace details table is color-coded: Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment. Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application. Application code in traces If a segment is listed as Application code in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use custom instrumentation to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as Application code for partial traces. Partial traces For performance reasons, New Relic APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the Details page: This is a partial trace. The New Relic APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments. APM agent Truncate segment rules C SDK Truncates based on segment priority: The root segment has the highest priority. Segments that have seen distributed tracing activity have second-highest priority. Slow segments have third-highest priority. For more information, see the C SDK's documentation about newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t on GitHub. Go The segment duration must be greater than the TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold value set in your Go segment configuration. Java, .NET, Ruby These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for Java, .NET, or Ruby as applicable. Node.js The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see Node.js transaction tracer configuration. PHP Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see PHP transaction tracer configuration. Python Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see Python transaction tracer configuration. Segment grouping rules Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping. For example, you might see a segment titled 7 fast method calls. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments. Rules underlying segment grouping include: Fast calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header. Identical calls: When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.",

Configure database query settings You can change database query settings in the same way you change other transaction trace settings; for example, via configuring the New Relic agent or, for some agents, via the UI. Common database query setting changes include: Collecting raw query data instead of obfuscated or turning off query collection Changing the stack trace threshold Turning on query explain plan collection Use database queries to improve performance Here are some tips to improve your app's database performance: Use database queries Comments Time Look for queries where the TOTAL DURATION contributes large amounts of time to the overall transaction time. This indicates a good place to try to enhance your database query with an index or some other optimization. Duplicate queries Look for queries that repeatedly query the same kind of information; for example, multiple queries to look up individual account IDs. Try rewriting the query to INCLUDE the specific values (account IDs 1, 2, 10, 14, 17, etc.) so that a single query can get all the relevant items. Database overhead Look at the structure of your queries to see if there are opportunities to combine different types of information into a single call; for example, querying for the account ID, name, etc. This is useful, for example, if your database center is in a different geographical location, because this will reduce overhead. The amount of time for your database request and response may be very fast. However, by combining requests into fewer calls, you can reduce that time even more. MySQL From your app's main APM Summary page, compare the database time on the main chart to other processing time. Sudden spikes or larger amounts of database time compared to other processing times may indicate problems. Find other slow queries The Trace details page is useful for examining a specific transaction's details. To see all of your application's slowest queries in one place, use the Slow queries feature.",

You can customize your configuration to collect even more metrics, giving you detailed characterization of database performance. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Oracle Database versions 11.2 and higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Linux distro compatible with infrastructure, except for RHEL/CentOS/OEL versions lower than 7. Install the infrastructure agent. Oracle Instant Client on the agent box. Oracle database with ORACLE_HOME configured to the correct directory for the root user. Oracle database user with both CONNECT and SELECT privileges on the required global views. Oracle database with a listener.ora file configured to monitor from a remote connection. By default, Oracle Database only listens to localhost. Oracle Database users and privileges In the Oracle database, execute the following statements to create a new user and assign user privileges. USERNAME and similar user-specific values must be replaced. If you use Oracle DB 12c or higher, use ALTER SESSION to access the database and manage users and user properties. Do not run this query if your Oracle DB version is lower than 12c. ALTER SESSION set \"_Oracle_SCRIPT\"=true; Copy Use CREATE USER to add a new user to the database. Replace USER_PASSWORD with the new user's password.

Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp oracledb-config.yml.sample oracledb-config.yml Copy Edit the oracledb-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The oracledb-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: service_name: Oracle Database service name of the instance (or cluster of instances) to monitor. This field is required. username: username of a user created with the required permissions. This field is required. password: password of a user created with the required permissions. This field is required. is_sys_dba: boolean value that indicates whether the authenticating user has SysDBA permissions. Default: false. oracle_home: path to where ORACLE_HOME is. This field is required. is_sys_oper: boolean value that indicates whether the authenticating user has SysOper permissions. Default: false. tablespaces: A JSON array of tablespaces to collect. If omitted, collects all tablespaces. Default: none (all tablespaces). Due to performance reasons, the integration will refuse to collect tablespace data for more than 200 tablespaces. If your database has more than 200 of tablespaces, you must restrict collection to a smaller number by using the tablespaces parameter. hostname: hostname of the instance to monitor. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which Oracle Database is running. Default: 1521. connection_string: a full connection string such as those found in tnsnames.ora. If this is specified, it takes priority over host, port, and service_name. extended_metrics: boolean value that indicates whether to collect extended metrics. Default: false. custom_metrics_query: a custom SQL query to run against the configured instance. Each row of the query is added as a new metric set on OracleCustomSample. Each non-null column in the row is added as an attribute on that metric set. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file that contains a list of queries, along with custom sample names and metric type overrides.

Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: The Oracle library cannot be loaded If monitoring remotely, install the Oracle Instant Client and follow the instructions on how to add libclntsh.so to the shared library search path. If monitoring from the box with Oracle Database installed, install the Oracle Instant Client and add the path ORACLE_HOME/lib to the ldconfig search path. ORACLE_HOME is not set correctly This error will appear in the logs as [ERR] ORA-01284: Error while trying to retrieve text for error. To avoid this error make sure ORACLE_HOME is set correctly for the agent process. The agent runs as root, so its environment is not the same as the oracle user. To verify this setting, execute cat /proc/$(pgrep newrelic-infra)/environ to print out the environment variables for the infrastructure process, the output should include ORACLE_HOME if configured correctly. I get an ORA error To resolve errors of the type ORA, refer to Oracle's error list. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Your app's dSYM files are stored in Xcode's dSYM archive path folder. This is the folder where New Relic Mobile gets the dSYM files that are used to symbolicate your crash reports. New Relic provides a post-build script as part of the New Relic Mobile's iOS agent's install process and the tvOS agent's install process. This script automatically uploads your app's dSYM files. Important This script uses Python 2. Starting October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. New Relic automatically uploads dSYM files only for release builds. Non-release builds must upload their files either manually or through the New Relic Mobile UI. Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, a few indicators are available in the New Relic Mobile UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: from the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the New Relic Mobile UI Crash analysis > Crash list > Crash type summary > Upload dSYM: You can quickly upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic Mobile UI. You can easily upload your dSYM files directly form the New Relic Mobile UI. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Tip The maximum file size is 600 MB. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command. Replace ~ /ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH with your new dSYM archive path and file name (for example, Users/my-name/desktop). Also replace ~ /dSYM_PATH with your existing dSYM file path. /usr/bin/zip --recurse-paths --quiet \"~/ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH\" \"~/dSYM_PATH\" Copy Upload the dSYM zip file using the following command: For a US account: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For a EU account: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu.newrelic.com/symbol Copy Troubleshooting Auto-upload failure If a dSYM auto-upload failed, the Report Navigator may have a fully formed cURL command. You can use this cURL command to reattempt an upload. Depending on the error, you may also need to follow some of the dSYM manual upload steps. Here is an example of a successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator: Example: A successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator. Missing dSYMs If dSYM files are missing, you may need to check Xcode build settings to ensure the file is being generated. Frameworks which are built locally have separate build settings and may need to be updated as well.

      "body": "Deploying an app can be a risky event—when your app breaks, a bad deployment is often the cause. New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deploy to your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts. Options for tracking deployments You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. You can use your Slack integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel. There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can view deployments in the UI: In the activity feed of the APM Summary, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages. On APM performance charts as a chart marker. On the Deployments page for summary performance. Tip Deployment markers are not available for Browser applications, but see Browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'Api-Key'='$API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher): $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") $data ='{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data) $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json') $request.Method = 'POST' $request.Headers.add('Api-Key','$API_KEY') $request.ContentType='application/json' $stream = $request.GetRequestStream() $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length) $request.GetResponse() Copy View a list of deployments with GET To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a GET request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i Copy The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Copy Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. Important UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. Notify your team of deployments After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. Tip You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "New Relic lets you set up automated user management (AUM), which allows you to import, update, and deactivate your New Relic users from your identity provider. Once this automated provisioning is complete, your users can log in to New Relic via their identity provider. Requirements Requirements and impacts: Requires Enterprise edition. User model-related requirements: This feature creates users on our New Relic One user model. To implement AUM, you must be on our New Relic One user model and have user management roles assigned. If you're on our original user model (or otherwise can't seem to implement this feature), talk to your New Relic account representative. Supports SAML 2.0 standard for single sign on (SSO). Supports SCIM 2.0 standard. Supported identity providers: Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin. For unsupported identity providers, we have a SCIM API. Notes on initial enabling of AUM: We don't currently support toggling SCIM on or off. If an authentication domain has already been set up with the source of users as Manual, you can't change it to SCIM. When first enabled, the bearer token is generated and only shown once. If you need to view a bearer token later, the only way to do this is to generate a new one, and that will invalidate the old one and any integrations using the old token. Import user groups from an identity provider using AUM For an explanation of how your identity provider groups map over to New Relic groups, see Group and role mapping. To use automated user management to import users from your identity provider: It's important to first review the requirements. Use the Organization and access UI to enable SCIM and configure SAML SSO. Configure your identity provider using one of our relevant guides:Azure AD | Okta | OneLogin. If you don't use one of those, we also have a SCIM API. Note that your users are created in New Relic as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. Recommended: Set a time zone in your identity provider. If not specified, our UI shows date/times with the UTC time zone. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). If you have issues, contact your account representative. After being provisioned, your users can click on the New Relic SCIM/SSO application tile in their identity provider to be logged into New Relic. To learn more about New Relic's roles and capabilities, see Standard roles.",

This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Step 1. Add SCIM/SSO application Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. Add the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to your list of applications. Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by Organization. Click on Add. Continue with the following section to connect the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to New Relic. Step 2. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 3. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 4. Assign users and groups After the New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration and the New Relic side configuration is finished, you can assign users and groups to the application. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on Users and groups in the sidebar. Click +Add user. From the Add Assignment page, click on Users and groups, and select the appropriate users or groups that you'd like to provision. Then click Select and Assign. The selected users and groups appear on the Users and groups page, indicating that they're candidates for provisioning. Repeat the steps to add users and groups until all desired entities have been assigned to the application. What's next? When you're done importing users, here are some potential next steps: Users created via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. After adding users, you'll want to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles. To learn how to do this, see Manage users.",

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Step 1. Add SCIM/SSO application Add the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to your Okta applications. Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Add Application. In the search field on the Okta Add Applications page, enter \"New Relic by Organization\" and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, check the two Application Visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 2. Configure provisioning Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API Integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. From the authentication domain UI, get the SCIM bearer token and input it in the New Relic SCIM/SSO app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API Credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create Users, Update User Attributes, and Deactivate Users sections. Click Save. Step 3. Assign users and groups After the New Relic SCIM/SSO application provisioning configuration and the New Relic side SSO configuration is finished, you can assign users to the application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs on the the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push Groups tab. Assignments tab From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to Groups. From the Assign ... to Groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Optional: in the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Members without a time zone configured, will use the group time zone. Time zone affects how date/times are shown in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). Click on Save and Go Back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push Groups tab. From the Push Groups form, click on Push Groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push Groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No Match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create Group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & Add Another and repeat the steps to add a group. Step 4. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push Groups tab. From the Push Groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic. What's next? When you're done importing users, here are some potential next steps: Users created via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI.

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon (;). For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. entity_guid Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENTITY_GUID The Entity GUID for the entity running this agent. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED Deprecated. For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module.prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string <a href=\"https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/glossary#apdex_f\">apdex_f</a>. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Deprecated; use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when <a href=\"#transaction_tracer.explain_enabled\">explain_enabled</a> is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED If true, the agent captures traced errors and error count metrics. error_collector.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Deprecated; use error_collector.attributes.enabled instead. error_collector.ignore_errors Type String Default \"ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Specify a comma-delimited list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution Server side configuration takes precedence for this setting over all environment configurations. This differs from all other configuration settings where environment variable take precedence over server side configuration. error_collector.max_backtrace_frames Type Integer Default 50 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_BACKTRACE_FRAMES Defines the maximum number of frames in an error backtrace. Backtraces over this amount are truncated at the beginning and end. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_EVENTS If true, the agent collects TransactionError events. error_collector.max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of TransactionError events sent to New Relic per harvest cycle. Browser Monitoring The Browser monitorig page load timing feature (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_AUTO_INSTRUMENT If true, enables auto-injection of the JavaScript header for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). browser_monitoring.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Deprecated; use browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled instead. Analytics Events New Relic dashboards is a resource to gather and visualize data about your software and what it says about your business. With it you can quickly and easily create real-time dashboards to get immediate answers about end-user experiences, clickstreams, mobile activities, and server transactions. analytics_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_ENABLED If true, enables analytics event sampling. analytics_events.max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1200 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of request events reported from a single harvest. analytics_events.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Deprecated; use transaction_events.attributes.enabled instead. Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. These key-value pairs can be viewed within transaction traces in APM, traced errors in APM, transaction events in dashboards, and page views in dashboards.

      "body": "New Relic Browser's Filterable Geography page provides a world view with color-coded performance information about cities, regions, and countries anywhere around the world. You can filter and drill down into detailed information, or use your mouse to select or zoom in and out of any location on the map. The enhanced attributes provide deep visibility not only about your end users' experience with page load timing, but also with network performance anywhere around the world. This level of visual detail is especially useful for professionals in IT and Operations to make business decisions about peering agreements and CDN usage. Contents Requirements Your New Relic Browser subscription level and your time picker settings determine what data you can view: Pro or higher: As of January 2016, the Filterable Geography feature automatically appears in your New Relic Browser user interface. No special setup is required. You can view up to eight days of data. Your application must be enabled to send PageView data to New Relic Insights in order to use Filterable Geography. Lite: The Filterable Geography feature appears in your New Relic Browser's UI menu but currently is not available for use. Any subscription level: If you need to use New Relic Browser's legacy Geography feature, you can still view it from your selected browser app. Factors affecting collected data To capture page load timing information, New Relic Browser uses the Navigation Timing API, which most (but not all) browsers support. If the browsers do not support the Navigation Timing API, then New Relic Browser charts and data points can only show the network data they receive for DNS lookup, connection, secure handshake, etc. This may not be 100% of the app's overall traffic. Also, firewalls may have an impact on the geographical data collected about your end users. View performance data by location one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map before drilling down into detailed information about London, England. To view or sort the performance information by location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Select the type of performance data to view from the dropdown, or use the default Average page load time. To drill down to a specific area, mouse over or select any area on the geographical map, or select any of the ten worst performing locations from the list to the right of the map. To view specific performance metrics, select any of the attributes below the funnel icon. To view comparison data, select the Page load performance or Historical performance chart below the selected location's geographical map. Use map functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions and page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the Filterable Geography page. If you want to... Do this... Change what kind of performance data appears Select your choice from the dropdown. Default performance indicator is Average page load time. The map's legend lists the ten best or worst performing areas (depending on the selected performance indicator) for the selected time period. For example: If you select Count, the map's legend shows the top ten locations with the highest number of page loads, as well as the average page load time for each. If you select Connection setup, New Relic Browser first filters out areas with low throughput. Then the map's legend shows the top ten locations where average connection time is the slowest, as well as the average page load time and count for each. View summary performance information about a specific location Mouse over any colored area on the map, select a location from the list, or zoom in and out of any area on the map. View detailed data for a location Select any area of the map. For example: If you select Canada, the map and legend show color-coded performance data for each province and territory. The list to the right of the map shows the top ten worst performing areas. If you select a specific province or territory, the map shows color-coded performance data for the top ten cities. The map includes circled locations which you can mouse over or select to view detailed information. In addition, the Page load performance and Historical performance charts below the map automatically update with each location you select. Hide the list of available attributes Select the funnel icon. Return to a larger world view Select another location on the map, or clear the filter labels above the map. Tip To return to the original map view of the world, select any area on an ocean. Examine heat map details one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map as you use filter and zoom tools to drill down into detailed information about London, England. Athough overall throughput for the area is good (green), the nearby yellow areas, and the smaller red and orange circles indicate nearby cities with varying levels of throughput problems, not the size of those cities. The Filterable Geography heat map identifies performance quality with color and with the size of circles. Heat map Description Color scale Performance quality ranges from green (the best) to yellow, orange, and then red (the worst). When selecting indicators of usage rather than performance, the heat map shows shades of purple, with the darkest shades indicating the highest usage. The color scale adapts to your app's specific performance. Each area is a percentile range. To view the range for each color segment, mouse over the heat map's legend. Thresholds Different thresholds are dynamically applied to the colors based on the type of performance indicator you select from the dropdown and the maximum value your app has reported. For example, green for Average page load time may indicate 0 to 3.3 seconds, while green for Average network time may indicate 0 to 256 milliseconds. Circles The map's colored circles help you identify areas with performance problems at a glance. Each circle's radius is based on throughput reported for the city it represents, not the size of the city itself. You may see many circles overlapping each other. This usually indicates a grouping of metropolitan areas which represent a geographic area of heavy traffic. Filter performance metrics The Filter feature allows you to select and group data by attributes in various categories, including: Page view Geography Browser Identity Custom The filtered results appear on the geographical map, where you can use any of the standard map functions to explore additional details. Here are some examples. Unsatisfactory network performance by ASN In this example, your organization is preparing to renew a peering agreement with the owner of an autonomous system, called \"My-ASN.\" You are concerned that continued outages and other connection issues are affecting customer satisfaction with your site, and you want to compare its performance with other ASNs. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. From the performance type dropdown, select Connection setup. Select the funnel icon. To view the specific ASN's performance: From the search window, type My-ASN, and then select this name from the Filter by results. OR To compare performance with other ASNs: From Geography attributes > ASN organizations, review the performance data for each organization on the list, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filter, select the attribute name. Page rendering performance during sales promotion In this example, your organization has a special three-day sales promotion for an upcoming holiday. Your holiday-merchandise page has undergone major changes, including dozens of new images. You want to look for performance problems with page rendering on Android mobile devices during this sales period. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Use the time picker to change the date range to the promotion period. From the performance type dropdown, select Page rendering. Select the funnel icon. From Page view attributes > Page Url, select your site's holiday-merchandise page, and then select Back to groupings list. From Browser attributes > User agent OS, select Android, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filters, select their attribute names. View comparative performance details Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with comparative performance details for the selected location. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with details for the selected location. The Page load performance tab shows two charts. The Average page load time chart includes: Average page load time for each segment of the page load timing process in seconds Request queuing information (the time after a request enters your production systems and before it reaches your application) if applicable The Average network time chart shows key elements, including how long it takes for DNS lookup, connection establishment, and secure handshake, in seconds. Tip Sometimes areas on the charts may appear to be zero or near zero. This is because some apps use existing TCP connections, and they do not need to establish new connections. The Historical performance tab shows comparison data for the selected time period, yesterday, and last week for the selected location. This includes: Average response time Throughput in pages per minute (ppm) Available metrics You can filter and group geographical performance data in New Relic Browser and in New Relic Insights. Available metrics include: Performance Metrics Webpage Page load time Throughput (pages per minute or ppm) Network time Connection time Secure connection time Network Autonomous system number and name (ASN) via IP mapping SSL negotiation timing DNS timing Time to first byte ASN latitude and longitude for Internet service providers (ISPs) To ensure end user security, New Relic Browser collects GeoIP information for the end user's ISP. New Relic Browser does not collect GeoIP information for the specific end user. For example, if an end user in Portland, Oregon uses an ISP located in Beaverton, Oregon, New Relic Browser collects the GeoIP information for the ISP in Beaverton. User agents Operating systems Browser names or types Browser versions Device types Performance and usage ranges The color-coded legend shows performance and usage as percentile ranges. Performance color ranges Percentile colors for performance range from green (the best) to red (the worst). Performance percentile ranges (best to worst) Green Yellow Orange Red Back-end duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Connection setup duration 0-96.9 97-97.9 98-98.9 99+ DNS lookup duration 0-96.9 97-97.9 98-98.9 99+ DOM processing duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Network duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Page load duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Page rendering duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Queue duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Secure handshake duration 0-96.9 97-97.9 98-98.9 99+ Web app duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Usage color ranges Percentile colors for usage counts appear as shades of purple, from lightest (lowest usage) to darkest (highest usage).

Page load timing, individual asset loads, user interactions, AJAX requests, callbacks, errors, and other events appear in an interactive timeline which includes a detailed waterfall visualization, a heat map overview, and highlighted metrics and problems related to that session. Identify problems and solutions Session traces help you understand: How users experience your page load, including time to DOM load, time waiting for AJAX requests to complete, and the user's interactions with the page How the New Relic metrics reflect your end users' experiences What is the sequence of JavaScript and browser events, which take longer than others, and when each event occurs Where bottlenecks occur, and what may be causing them Why one page load may be slower than others, by providing the context for individual events during a session By connecting performance to user experience and interactions to performance, this detailed and intuitive visualization of all events in the user's session can help pinpoint problem areas and easily identify solutions. Requirements To use Browser monitoring's session traces feature, make sure you meet these requirements: Your agent version must support Browser monitoring. If you're using multiple names for an app, session traces will only report to the most specific application. For accounts older than October 2014, you must enable Browser monitoring and the enhanced Pro features. Browser randomly captures traces only from browsers that support the Resource Timing API. Select a session trace The Session traces index lists the most recent traces based on the time picker selection for the selected app. Session traces are randomly sampled and stored at a rate of 90/hour. You can page through up to 500 traces at a time. Additionally, you can sort and search the list by attributes, including: Full URL, with query string parameters removed Browser type Started at date/time Page load time one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces: You can select a session trace from the Browser index. You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors, and AJAX pages. To select a specific session trace: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > Session traces. To locate a session trace from a different date or time period, use the time picker. To limit the index to a specific type of trace, use the search window. To view detailed information, select the session trace's link. Tip You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors and AJAX pages. View session trace details The Session trace details page provides summary information about the trace, a heat map with timing details, and a waterfall of events that you can explore. The color-coded legend identifies the page load events during the webpage's life cycle. For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser monitoring includes web app and queue time in Network time as part of the page load timing process. This is because Browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the Browser agent through auto-injection. You can view detailed information about how this \"back end\" time breaks down from the browser's point of view. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser spends time on DNS lookups and other network events. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces > (select a trace): Use Browser's session trace details to examine events and identify problems during the end user's webpage session. To navigate through a session trace, explore the waterfall chart by scrolling vertically through the event stack, or select individual events to view their details. If you want to... Do this... View the web page for this session trace Select the trace link. Jump to a specific time Select the time indicator or event on the heat map. View details about individual events Select any event in the waterfall chart. From there, select View full details if applicable. Change the location on the session trace Click on the heat map, or scroll vertically through the waterfall chart. Zoom in or out of the overall trace Select the plus or minus icons below the heat map. Share the session trace information Create a permalink to paste into a form, ticket, email, etc. Session segment definitions Important session trace measurements are displayed in the upper right corner of the Session traces page. The first four measurements represent how long into a session that the segment ended. For example, if Page Load is 0.202s, that means that the page load event completed 0.202 seconds after the request began. Session segment Description Backend The time from when the request began to when backend activity finished and DOM loading began. DOM processing The time from when the request began to when DOM processing finished. Page load The time from when the request began to when the page load event fired. Waiting on AJAX The time from when the request began to when AJAX activity ended. First interaction The time from when the request began to when the first user activity, like a mouse click or a scroll, was recorded. Duration The total duration of the session. Slow JavaScript execution and repainting Session traces help you identify callbacks in your JavaScript code that execute slowly and block the execution of subsequent calls on the browser's main thread. These calls should execute quickly in order to allow the browser to quickly repaint the page in response to user actions. Session traces highlight any callbacks longer than 33ms. If called in rapid succession (such as inside a requestAnimationFrame loop), callbacks longer than 33ms reduce the frame rate below 30 frames per second. This speed seems sluggish to users.",

View error profiles To view Browser monitoring error profiles: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > JS errors. To see error profile details: At the bottom of the JS errors UI page, select an error profile to expand it. What are error profiles? In Browser monitoring, an error profile is a potentially meaningful correlation New Relic has found between your JavaScript error attribute values when compared to normal PageView events. These correlations help you investigate the causes and contributing factors behind your errors. The screenshot below shows an example of an error profile. This error profile shows that the distribution of the userAgentOS attribute values varies significantly when JS error events are compared to normal (non-error) page view events. To investigate further, you could use the filter to display only Windows errors and see if there are other correlations. You can also filter the data used to generate error profiles to help you narrow down potential causes. For an analysis of a specific error profile, see the example error profile explanation. Filter error profile data To further filter the data used to generate error profiles and their comparison page views, use these JS errors page features: Time picker: select a time range used to generate the data. Filter: use the filter to display only error profiles and page views that have the attribute values you choose. You can select multiple attribute values. Example error profile explanation To help you better understand your own error profile data, this is an explanation of an example error profile's data. This error profile example has had a filter of userAgentName = Chrome applied, so it is only showing error data from Chrome browsers. This example profile has had a filter applied so that it is only showing error data from Chrome browsers. Column explanations: The first column is the attribute column. It shows the attribute values with the most deviation when compared to non-error page views. Less significant attribute values are aggregated in the Other category. In this example, the Chrome versions 36, 64, and 65 make up 100% of the errors for Chrome users. The JS errors column shows what percentage of JavaScriptError events have the attribute values from the first column. This column adds up to 100%, representing all errors from the chosen time range and filter set. In this example, a large percentage of Chrome errors are coming from Chrome version 36. If we wanted to investigate this further, we could filter to only show version 36 data. The Page views column shows what percentage of PageView events have the attribute values from the first column. In this example, less than 1% of Chrome users use Chrome version 36, but 55% of errors are generated by users with that version. The Difference column shows you the difference in percentage between the JS errors column and the Page views column. In this example, the 54% indicates that attribute is 54 percentage points higher for error events than for page views.",

You can filter and drill down into detailed information, or use your mouse to select or zoom in and out of any location on the map. The enhanced attributes provide deep visibility not only about your end users' experience with page load timing, but also with network performance anywhere around the world. This level of visual detail is especially useful for professionals in IT and Operations to make business decisions about peering agreements and CDN usage. Contents Requirements Your New Relic Browser subscription level and your time picker settings determine what data you can view: Pro or higher: As of January 2016, the Filterable Geography feature automatically appears in your New Relic Browser user interface. No special setup is required. You can view up to eight days of data. Your application must be enabled to send PageView data to New Relic Insights in order to use Filterable Geography. Lite: The Filterable Geography feature appears in your New Relic Browser's UI menu but currently is not available for use. Any subscription level: If you need to use New Relic Browser's legacy Geography feature, you can still view it from your selected browser app. Factors affecting collected data To capture page load timing information, New Relic Browser uses the Navigation Timing API, which most (but not all) browsers support. If the browsers do not support the Navigation Timing API, then New Relic Browser charts and data points can only show the network data they receive for DNS lookup, connection, secure handshake, etc. This may not be 100% of the app's overall traffic. Also, firewalls may have an impact on the geographical data collected about your end users. View performance data by location one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map before drilling down into detailed information about London, England. To view or sort the performance information by location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Select the type of performance data to view from the dropdown, or use the default Average page load time. To drill down to a specific area, mouse over or select any area on the geographical map, or select any of the ten worst performing locations from the list to the right of the map. To view specific performance metrics, select any of the attributes below the funnel icon. To view comparison data, select the Page load performance or Historical performance chart below the selected location's geographical map. Use map functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions and page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the Filterable Geography page. If you want to... Do this... Change what kind of performance data appears Select your choice from the dropdown. Default performance indicator is Average page load time. The map's legend lists the ten best or worst performing areas (depending on the selected performance indicator) for the selected time period. For example: If you select Count, the map's legend shows the top ten locations with the highest number of page loads, as well as the average page load time for each. If you select Connection setup, New Relic Browser first filters out areas with low throughput. Then the map's legend shows the top ten locations where average connection time is the slowest, as well as the average page load time and count for each. View summary performance information about a specific location Mouse over any colored area on the map, select a location from the list, or zoom in and out of any area on the map. View detailed data for a location Select any area of the map. For example: If you select Canada, the map and legend show color-coded performance data for each province and territory. The list to the right of the map shows the top ten worst performing areas. If you select a specific province or territory, the map shows color-coded performance data for the top ten cities. The map includes circled locations which you can mouse over or select to view detailed information. In addition, the Page load performance and Historical performance charts below the map automatically update with each location you select. Hide the list of available attributes Select the funnel icon. Return to a larger world view Select another location on the map, or clear the filter labels above the map. Tip To return to the original map view of the world, select any area on an ocean. Examine heat map details one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map as you use filter and zoom tools to drill down into detailed information about London, England. Athough overall throughput for the area is good (green), the nearby yellow areas, and the smaller red and orange circles indicate nearby cities with varying levels of throughput problems, not the size of those cities. The Filterable Geography heat map identifies performance quality with color and with the size of circles. Heat map Description Color scale Performance quality ranges from green (the best) to yellow, orange, and then red (the worst). When selecting indicators of usage rather than performance, the heat map shows shades of purple, with the darkest shades indicating the highest usage. The color scale adapts to your app's specific performance. Each area is a percentile range. To view the range for each color segment, mouse over the heat map's legend. Thresholds Different thresholds are dynamically applied to the colors based on the type of performance indicator you select from the dropdown and the maximum value your app has reported. For example, green for Average page load time may indicate 0 to 3.3 seconds, while green for Average network time may indicate 0 to 256 milliseconds. Circles The map's colored circles help you identify areas with performance problems at a glance. Each circle's radius is based on throughput reported for the city it represents, not the size of the city itself. You may see many circles overlapping each other. This usually indicates a grouping of metropolitan areas which represent a geographic area of heavy traffic. Filter performance metrics The Filter feature allows you to select and group data by attributes in various categories, including: Page view Geography Browser Identity Custom The filtered results appear on the geographical map, where you can use any of the standard map functions to explore additional details. Here are some examples. Unsatisfactory network performance by ASN In this example, your organization is preparing to renew a peering agreement with the owner of an autonomous system, called \"My-ASN.\" You are concerned that continued outages and other connection issues are affecting customer satisfaction with your site, and you want to compare its performance with other ASNs. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. From the performance type dropdown, select Connection setup. Select the funnel icon. To view the specific ASN's performance: From the search window, type My-ASN, and then select this name from the Filter by results. OR To compare performance with other ASNs: From Geography attributes > ASN organizations, review the performance data for each organization on the list, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filter, select the attribute name. Page rendering performance during sales promotion In this example, your organization has a special three-day sales promotion for an upcoming holiday. Your holiday-merchandise page has undergone major changes, including dozens of new images. You want to look for performance problems with page rendering on Android mobile devices during this sales period. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Use the time picker to change the date range to the promotion period. From the performance type dropdown, select Page rendering. Select the funnel icon. From Page view attributes > Page Url, select your site's holiday-merchandise page, and then select Back to groupings list. From Browser attributes > User agent OS, select Android, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filters, select their attribute names. View comparative performance details Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with comparative performance details for the selected location. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with details for the selected location. The Page load performance tab shows two charts. The Average page load time chart includes: Average page load time for each segment of the page load timing process in seconds Request queuing information (the time after a request enters your production systems and before it reaches your application) if applicable The Average network time chart shows key elements, including how long it takes for DNS lookup, connection establishment, and secure handshake, in seconds. Tip Sometimes areas on the charts may appear to be zero or near zero. This is because some apps use existing TCP connections, and they do not need to establish new connections. The Historical performance tab shows comparison data for the selected time period, yesterday, and last week for the selected location. This includes: Average response time Throughput in pages per minute (ppm) Available metrics You can filter and group geographical performance data in New Relic Browser and in New Relic Insights. Available metrics include: Performance Metrics Webpage Page load time Throughput (pages per minute or ppm) Network time Connection time Secure connection time Network Autonomous system number and name (ASN) via IP mapping SSL negotiation timing DNS timing Time to first byte ASN latitude and longitude for Internet service providers (ISPs) To ensure end user security, New Relic Browser collects GeoIP information for the end user's ISP. New Relic Browser does not collect GeoIP information for the specific end user. For example, if an end user in Portland, Oregon uses an ISP located in Beaverton, Oregon, New Relic Browser collects the GeoIP information for the ISP in Beaverton.

View error profiles To view Browser monitoring error profiles: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > JS errors. To see error profile details: At the bottom of the JS errors UI page, select an error profile to expand it. What are error profiles? In Browser monitoring, an error profile is a potentially meaningful correlation New Relic has found between your JavaScript error attribute values when compared to normal PageView events. These correlations help you investigate the causes and contributing factors behind your errors. The screenshot below shows an example of an error profile. This error profile shows that the distribution of the userAgentOS attribute values varies significantly when JS error events are compared to normal (non-error) page view events. To investigate further, you could use the filter to display only Windows errors and see if there are other correlations. You can also filter the data used to generate error profiles to help you narrow down potential causes. For an analysis of a specific error profile, see the example error profile explanation. Filter error profile data To further filter the data used to generate error profiles and their comparison page views, use these JS errors page features: Time picker: select a time range used to generate the data. Filter: use the filter to display only error profiles and page views that have the attribute values you choose. You can select multiple attribute values. Example error profile explanation To help you better understand your own error profile data, this is an explanation of an example error profile's data. This error profile example has had a filter of userAgentName = Chrome applied, so it is only showing error data from Chrome browsers. This example profile has had a filter applied so that it is only showing error data from Chrome browsers. Column explanations: The first column is the attribute column. It shows the attribute values with the most deviation when compared to non-error page views. Less significant attribute values are aggregated in the Other category. In this example, the Chrome versions 36, 64, and 65 make up 100% of the errors for Chrome users. The JS errors column shows what percentage of JavaScriptError events have the attribute values from the first column. This column adds up to 100%, representing all errors from the chosen time range and filter set. In this example, a large percentage of Chrome errors are coming from Chrome version 36. If we wanted to investigate this further, we could filter to only show version 36 data. The Page views column shows what percentage of PageView events have the attribute values from the first column. In this example, less than 1% of Chrome users use Chrome version 36, but 55% of errors are generated by users with that version. The Difference column shows you the difference in percentage between the JS errors column and the Page views column. In this example, the 54% indicates that attribute is 54 percentage points higher for error events than for page views.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring supports the uploading of source maps, which are used to un-minify error stack traces on the JS errors page. This document explains how to use the API to publish (upload) source maps to Browser. Prepare for using the source map API In order to upload source maps to Browser via the API, you'll need this information: A user API key (before November 20, 2020, the Admin API key was required; that will still work if already in place) The New Relic application ID for the deployed app The full JavaScript file URL Optionally, if the JavaScript URL doesn't automatically have release info appended to it, the release name and ID What is the JavaScript URL? Every time the agent captures an error in your code, it's associated with the URL of the JavaScript in which it occurred. This is the src attribute of the script tag in your HTML. This full JavaScript URL is required when sending source maps to Browser. You can find the URL for an error's JavaScript file in Browser, on the JS errors page. See Browser monitoring source maps for more on finding these errors in the UI. Is a release name and ID required? Many organizations include a version number or hash in the JavaScript URL. This is generally added to \"bust\" caches to ensure your users get the most recent version of your code. This type of URL might look something like: https://example.com/assets/application-59.min.js https://example.com/assets/bundle-d6d031.min.js https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.js If your app's URLs automatically have the version info appended to it, the Browser agent has everything it needs in order to match errors with your code. You can move ahead to generating source maps. If this doesn't apply to you, and JS URLs do not have version info appended, you’ll have to assist the agent by specifying a release name and ID with the API. Are there limits to source map uploads? There is no limit to the overall number of source maps you can upload. However, the API is rate-limited: You can upload a maximum of 100 source maps per minute You can upload a maximum of 5,000 source maps per day Source map files can be a maximum of 50Mb in size. Push source maps to New Relic Now that you have one or more source maps, you are ready to publish it to Browser. You can use any of these methods to send source maps to Browser: Use the New Relic npm module with the API via the command line or via a client-side JavaScript build/deploy script like Gulp or Grunt. Use API curl commands. Use the Browser UI. Use npm module via command line or client-side script The easiest and recommended way to upload source maps to Browser is to use the our new @newrelic/publish-sourcemap npm module. It provides a command line tool and Javascript API to accomplish this task. More documentation is available in the npm repo. Here are some examples of using the npm module via the command line. Important The following examples are for US accounts. For EU accounts, the endpoint is https://sourcemaps.service.eu.newrelic.com. For more information, see Introduction to the EU region data center. npm command line: Publish Here's an example of uploading source maps using the npm module via the command line. Note that the source map can come from a local file or a remote URL. npm install -g @newrelic/publish-sourcemap publish-sourcemap PATH_TO_SOURCE_MAP_FILE (local or remote) PATH_TO_ORIGINAL_FILE --apiKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY --applicationId=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID Copy npm command line: List published maps Here's an example of listing published source maps: list-sourcemaps --applicationId=YOUR_APP_ID --apiKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY Options: --applicationId Browser application id --apiKey New Relic user API key Copy npm command line: Delete Here's an example of deleting a source map: delete-sourcemap --applicationId=YOUR_APP_ID --apiKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY --sourcemapId=YOUR_SOURCE_MAP_ID Options: --applicationId Browser application id --apiKey New Relic user API key --sourcemapId Unique id generated for a source map Copy Here are some examples of using the npm module to publish from client-side JavaScript: npm via Node.js script: Publish Here's an example of publishing a source map via a Node.js script: var publishSourcemap = require(‘@newrelic/publish-sourcemap’).publishSourcemap publishSourcemap({ sourcemapPath: 'SOURCE_MAP_FULL_PATH', javascriptUrl: 'JS_URL', applicationId: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID, apiKey: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY' }, function (err) { console.log(err || 'Sourcemap upload done')}) Copy npm via Node.js script: List published maps Here's an example of listing all published source maps: var listSourcemaps = require(‘@newrelic/publish-sourcemap’).listSourcemaps listSourcemaps({ sourcemapPath: 'SOURCE_MAP_FULL_PATH', javascriptUrl: 'JS_URL', applicationId: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID, apiKey: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY', }, function (err, res) { console.log(err || res.body)}) Copy npm via Node.js script: Delete Here's an example of deleting a source map file via a Node.js script: var deleteSourcemap = require(‘@newrelic/publish-sourcemap’).deleteSourcemap deleteSourcemap({ sourcemapId: 'SOURCE_MAP_ID', applicationId: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID, apiKey: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY', }, function (err) { console.log(err || 'Deleted source map')}) Copy When you're done, go to the JS errors page in Browser, select an error grouping, and see if your error stack traces have been un-minified. Use API via curl Below are some examples of using curl to publish, list, and delete source maps: curl: Upload maps An example of using API via curl to publish maps to Browser: curl -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY\" \\ -F \"sourcemap=@SOURCE_MAP_PATH\" \\ -F \"javascriptUrl=JS_URL\" \\ -F \"releaseId=YOUR_RELEASE_ID\" \\ -F \"releaseName=YOUR_UI_PAGE\" \\ https://sourcemaps.service.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID/sourcemaps Copy curl: List existing maps Below is an example of how to get a list of source maps previously uploaded to New Relic via curl. New Relic returns the source map's unique SOURCEMAP_ID and its components: curl \\ -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY\" \\ https://sourcemaps.service.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID/sourcemaps Copy curl: Delete map To delete a source map: Use the GET endpoint to list existing source maps and locate the SOURCEMAP_ID. Run the following command via curl: curl -X DELETE \\ -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY\" \\ https://sourcemaps.service.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID/sourcemaps/SOURCEMAP_ID Copy When you're done, go to the JS errors page in Browser, select an error grouping, and see if your error stack traces have been un-minified. Troubleshoot source maps If you are having trouble generating source maps from your build system, or if your errors in Browser are remaining minified, see the source maps troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "New Relic Browser's Filterable Geography page provides a world view with color-coded performance information about cities, regions, and countries anywhere around the world. You can filter and drill down into detailed information, or use your mouse to select or zoom in and out of any location on the map. The enhanced attributes provide deep visibility not only about your end users' experience with page load timing, but also with network performance anywhere around the world. This level of visual detail is especially useful for professionals in IT and Operations to make business decisions about peering agreements and CDN usage. Contents Requirements Your New Relic Browser subscription level and your time picker settings determine what data you can view: Pro or higher: As of January 2016, the Filterable Geography feature automatically appears in your New Relic Browser user interface. No special setup is required. You can view up to eight days of data. Your application must be enabled to send PageView data to New Relic Insights in order to use Filterable Geography. Lite: The Filterable Geography feature appears in your New Relic Browser's UI menu but currently is not available for use. Any subscription level: If you need to use New Relic Browser's legacy Geography feature, you can still view it from your selected browser app. Factors affecting collected data To capture page load timing information, New Relic Browser uses the Navigation Timing API, which most (but not all) browsers support. If the browsers do not support the Navigation Timing API, then New Relic Browser charts and data points can only show the network data they receive for DNS lookup, connection, secure handshake, etc. This may not be 100% of the app's overall traffic. Also, firewalls may have an impact on the geographical data collected about your end users. View performance data by location one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map before drilling down into detailed information about London, England. To view or sort the performance information by location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Select the type of performance data to view from the dropdown, or use the default Average page load time. To drill down to a specific area, mouse over or select any area on the geographical map, or select any of the ten worst performing locations from the list to the right of the map. To view specific performance metrics, select any of the attributes below the funnel icon. To view comparison data, select the Page load performance or Historical performance chart below the selected location's geographical map. Use map functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions and page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the Filterable Geography page. If you want to... Do this... Change what kind of performance data appears Select your choice from the dropdown. Default performance indicator is Average page load time. The map's legend lists the ten best or worst performing areas (depending on the selected performance indicator) for the selected time period. For example: If you select Count, the map's legend shows the top ten locations with the highest number of page loads, as well as the average page load time for each. If you select Connection setup, New Relic Browser first filters out areas with low throughput. Then the map's legend shows the top ten locations where average connection time is the slowest, as well as the average page load time and count for each. View summary performance information about a specific location Mouse over any colored area on the map, select a location from the list, or zoom in and out of any area on the map. View detailed data for a location Select any area of the map. For example: If you select Canada, the map and legend show color-coded performance data for each province and territory. The list to the right of the map shows the top ten worst performing areas. If you select a specific province or territory, the map shows color-coded performance data for the top ten cities. The map includes circled locations which you can mouse over or select to view detailed information. In addition, the Page load performance and Historical performance charts below the map automatically update with each location you select. Hide the list of available attributes Select the funnel icon. Return to a larger world view Select another location on the map, or clear the filter labels above the map. Tip To return to the original map view of the world, select any area on an ocean. Examine heat map details one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map as you use filter and zoom tools to drill down into detailed information about London, England. Athough overall throughput for the area is good (green), the nearby yellow areas, and the smaller red and orange circles indicate nearby cities with varying levels of throughput problems, not the size of those cities. The Filterable Geography heat map identifies performance quality with color and with the size of circles. Heat map Description Color scale Performance quality ranges from green (the best) to yellow, orange, and then red (the worst). When selecting indicators of usage rather than performance, the heat map shows shades of purple, with the darkest shades indicating the highest usage. The color scale adapts to your app's specific performance. Each area is a percentile range. To view the range for each color segment, mouse over the heat map's legend. Thresholds Different thresholds are dynamically applied to the colors based on the type of performance indicator you select from the dropdown and the maximum value your app has reported. For example, green for Average page load time may indicate 0 to 3.3 seconds, while green for Average network time may indicate 0 to 256 milliseconds. Circles The map's colored circles help you identify areas with performance problems at a glance. Each circle's radius is based on throughput reported for the city it represents, not the size of the city itself. You may see many circles overlapping each other. This usually indicates a grouping of metropolitan areas which represent a geographic area of heavy traffic. Filter performance metrics The Filter feature allows you to select and group data by attributes in various categories, including: Page view Geography Browser Identity Custom The filtered results appear on the geographical map, where you can use any of the standard map functions to explore additional details. Here are some examples. Unsatisfactory network performance by ASN In this example, your organization is preparing to renew a peering agreement with the owner of an autonomous system, called \"My-ASN.\" You are concerned that continued outages and other connection issues are affecting customer satisfaction with your site, and you want to compare its performance with other ASNs. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. From the performance type dropdown, select Connection setup. Select the funnel icon. To view the specific ASN's performance: From the search window, type My-ASN, and then select this name from the Filter by results. OR To compare performance with other ASNs: From Geography attributes > ASN organizations, review the performance data for each organization on the list, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filter, select the attribute name. Page rendering performance during sales promotion In this example, your organization has a special three-day sales promotion for an upcoming holiday. Your holiday-merchandise page has undergone major changes, including dozens of new images. You want to look for performance problems with page rendering on Android mobile devices during this sales period. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Use the time picker to change the date range to the promotion period. From the performance type dropdown, select Page rendering. Select the funnel icon. From Page view attributes > Page Url, select your site's holiday-merchandise page, and then select Back to groupings list. From Browser attributes > User agent OS, select Android, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filters, select their attribute names. View comparative performance details Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with comparative performance details for the selected location. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with details for the selected location. The Page load performance tab shows two charts. The Average page load time chart includes: Average page load time for each segment of the page load timing process in seconds Request queuing information (the time after a request enters your production systems and before it reaches your application) if applicable The Average network time chart shows key elements, including how long it takes for DNS lookup, connection establishment, and secure handshake, in seconds. Tip Sometimes areas on the charts may appear to be zero or near zero. This is because some apps use existing TCP connections, and they do not need to establish new connections. The Historical performance tab shows comparison data for the selected time period, yesterday, and last week for the selected location. This includes: Average response time Throughput in pages per minute (ppm) Available metrics You can filter and group geographical performance data in New Relic Browser and in New Relic Insights. Available metrics include: Performance Metrics Webpage Page load time Throughput (pages per minute or ppm) Network time Connection time Secure connection time Network Autonomous system number and name (ASN) via IP mapping SSL negotiation timing DNS timing Time to first byte ASN latitude and longitude for Internet service providers (ISPs) To ensure end user security, New Relic Browser collects GeoIP information for the end user's ISP. New Relic Browser does not collect GeoIP information for the specific end user. For example, if an end user in Portland, Oregon uses an ISP located in Beaverton, Oregon, New Relic Browser collects the GeoIP information for the ISP in Beaverton.

Page load timing, individual asset loads, user interactions, AJAX requests, callbacks, errors, and other events appear in an interactive timeline which includes a detailed waterfall visualization, a heat map overview, and highlighted metrics and problems related to that session. Identify problems and solutions Session traces help you understand: How users experience your page load, including time to DOM load, time waiting for AJAX requests to complete, and the user's interactions with the page How the New Relic metrics reflect your end users' experiences What is the sequence of JavaScript and browser events, which take longer than others, and when each event occurs Where bottlenecks occur, and what may be causing them Why one page load may be slower than others, by providing the context for individual events during a session By connecting performance to user experience and interactions to performance, this detailed and intuitive visualization of all events in the user's session can help pinpoint problem areas and easily identify solutions. Requirements To use Browser monitoring's session traces feature, make sure you meet these requirements: Your agent version must support Browser monitoring. If you're using multiple names for an app, session traces will only report to the most specific application. For accounts older than October 2014, you must enable Browser monitoring and the enhanced Pro features. Browser randomly captures traces only from browsers that support the Resource Timing API. Select a session trace The Session traces index lists the most recent traces based on the time picker selection for the selected app. Session traces are randomly sampled and stored at a rate of 90/hour. You can page through up to 500 traces at a time. Additionally, you can sort and search the list by attributes, including: Full URL, with query string parameters removed Browser type Started at date/time Page load time one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces: You can select a session trace from the Browser index. You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors, and AJAX pages. To select a specific session trace: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > Session traces. To locate a session trace from a different date or time period, use the time picker. To limit the index to a specific type of trace, use the search window. To view detailed information, select the session trace's link. Tip You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors and AJAX pages. View session trace details The Session trace details page provides summary information about the trace, a heat map with timing details, and a waterfall of events that you can explore. The color-coded legend identifies the page load events during the webpage's life cycle. For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser monitoring includes web app and queue time in Network time as part of the page load timing process. This is because Browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the Browser agent through auto-injection. You can view detailed information about how this \"back end\" time breaks down from the browser's point of view. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser spends time on DNS lookups and other network events. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces > (select a trace): Use Browser's session trace details to examine events and identify problems during the end user's webpage session. To navigate through a session trace, explore the waterfall chart by scrolling vertically through the event stack, or select individual events to view their details. If you want to... Do this... View the web page for this session trace Select the trace link. Jump to a specific time Select the time indicator or event on the heat map. View details about individual events Select any event in the waterfall chart. From there, select View full details if applicable. Change the location on the session trace Click on the heat map, or scroll vertically through the waterfall chart. Zoom in or out of the overall trace Select the plus or minus icons below the heat map. Share the session trace information Create a permalink to paste into a form, ticket, email, etc. Session segment definitions Important session trace measurements are displayed in the upper right corner of the Session traces page. The first four measurements represent how long into a session that the segment ended. For example, if Page Load is 0.202s, that means that the page load event completed 0.202 seconds after the request began. Session segment Description Backend The time from when the request began to when backend activity finished and DOM loading began. DOM processing The time from when the request began to when DOM processing finished. Page load The time from when the request began to when the page load event fired. Waiting on AJAX The time from when the request began to when AJAX activity ended. First interaction The time from when the request began to when the first user activity, like a mouse click or a scroll, was recorded. Duration The total duration of the session. Slow JavaScript execution and repainting Session traces help you identify callbacks in your JavaScript code that execute slowly and block the execution of subsequent calls on the browser's main thread. These calls should execute quickly in order to allow the browser to quickly repaint the page in response to user actions. Session traces highlight any callbacks longer than 33ms. If called in rapid succession (such as inside a requestAnimationFrame loop), callbacks longer than 33ms reduce the frame rate below 30 frames per second. This speed seems sluggish to users.",

View error profiles To view Browser monitoring error profiles: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > JS errors. To see error profile details: At the bottom of the JS errors UI page, select an error profile to expand it. What are error profiles? In Browser monitoring, an error profile is a potentially meaningful correlation New Relic has found between your JavaScript error attribute values when compared to normal PageView events. These correlations help you investigate the causes and contributing factors behind your errors. The screenshot below shows an example of an error profile. This error profile shows that the distribution of the userAgentOS attribute values varies significantly when JS error events are compared to normal (non-error) page view events. To investigate further, you could use the filter to display only Windows errors and see if there are other correlations. You can also filter the data used to generate error profiles to help you narrow down potential causes. For an analysis of a specific error profile, see the example error profile explanation. Filter error profile data To further filter the data used to generate error profiles and their comparison page views, use these JS errors page features: Time picker: select a time range used to generate the data. Filter: use the filter to display only error profiles and page views that have the attribute values you choose. You can select multiple attribute values. Example error profile explanation To help you better understand your own error profile data, this is an explanation of an example error profile's data. This error profile example has had a filter of userAgentName = Chrome applied, so it is only showing error data from Chrome browsers. This example profile has had a filter applied so that it is only showing error data from Chrome browsers. Column explanations: The first column is the attribute column. It shows the attribute values with the most deviation when compared to non-error page views. Less significant attribute values are aggregated in the Other category. In this example, the Chrome versions 36, 64, and 65 make up 100% of the errors for Chrome users. The JS errors column shows what percentage of JavaScriptError events have the attribute values from the first column. This column adds up to 100%, representing all errors from the chosen time range and filter set. In this example, a large percentage of Chrome errors are coming from Chrome version 36. If we wanted to investigate this further, we could filter to only show version 36 data. The Page views column shows what percentage of PageView events have the attribute values from the first column. In this example, less than 1% of Chrome users use Chrome version 36, but 55% of errors are generated by users with that version. The Difference column shows you the difference in percentage between the JS errors column and the Page views column. In this example, the 54% indicates that attribute is 54 percentage points higher for error events than for page views.",

      "body": "Our Python agent lets you change the default agent behavior agent using configuration options. The only required Python agent configuration setting is the license key. The license key identifies the account where the agent reports application data. Depending on how you are hosting your application, the license key can be provided via a configuration file or an environment variable. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Python agent is via the configuration file, which is generated as part of the standard install process. It is also possible to set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI or by using environment variables. You can also specify some settings on a per-request basis by passing settings with the WSGI request environ dictionary. The Python agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: With the Python agent, per-request options override server-side config. If enabled, server-side config overrides all corresponding values in the agent config file, even if the server-side values are left blank. The agent config file overrides environment variables. Environment variables override the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file Typically you configure your Python agent from a local configuration file on the agent's host system. Supply the path to the config file at startup using one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the path to the config file as the first argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you use the newrelic-admin wrapper script, you must use the environment variable because the wrapper script calls the agent automatically. The configuration file uses a structure similar to Microsoft Windows .ini files. For more information, see the Python ConfigParser module's file format documentation. Tip A sample configuration file is included with the Python agent as newrelic/newrelic.ini. You can also generate one from the newrelic-admin script using the generate-config command, or download a copy from our download repo. Server-side configuration Tip Owner or Admins Server-side configuration allows you to configure certain settings in the New Relic One UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. Important If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the config file that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty string and does not use the agent config file. Environment variables Environment variables allow you to override the defaults for certain core settings. If the equivalent setting is explicitly listed in the agent config file, the config file settings take precedence over the environment variable. Where available, environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. For simple configurations, you can use the environment variables in conjunction with server-side configuration and avoid the agent config file altogether. This is the default setup with Heroku, where installing the New Relic add-on automatically populates the necessary environment variables. Environment variable Configuration setting NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY license_key NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME app_name NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE monitor_mode NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE developer_mode NEW_RELIC_LOG log_file NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL log_level NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY high_security NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME proxy_scheme NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST proxy_host NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT proxy_port NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER proxy_user NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS proxy_pass NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG audit_log_file NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT startup_timeout NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT shutdown_timeout NEW_RELIC_LABELS labels NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME process_host.display_name NEW_RELIC_API_KEY api_key NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH ca_bundle_path NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED distributed_tracing.enabled NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG feature_flag Per-request configuration For certain WSGI servers, you can override the app name and capture attributes settings on a per-request basis. This is possible with WSGI servers where you can define additional key/value pairs that are passed into the per-request WSGI environ dictionary. Set these values with the strings on, off, true, false, 1 and 0. If set from a configuration mechanism implemented using Python code, Python objects evaluating to True or False will also be accepted. Example: Apache/mod_wsgi app name In the Apache/mod_wsgi server, you can use the SetEnv directive to override config settings (optionally inside a Location or Directory block). For example, you could override the app name for a complete virtual host, or for a subset of URLs handled by the WSGI application for that virtual host. In addition to being able to override certain agent configuration settings, you can set other per-request configuration settings with their WSGI environment key: newrelic.set_background_task If set to true, this web transaction will instead be reported as a non-web transaction. newrelic.ignore_transaction If set to true, this web transaction will not be reported. newrelic.suppress_apdex_metric If set to true, no Apdex metric will be generated for this web transaction. newrelic.suppress_transaction_trace If set to true, this web transaction cannot be recorded in a transaction trace. newrelic.disable_browser_autorum If set to true, this disables automatic insertion of the JavaScript header/footer for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). Only applicable if auto-insertion is available for your web framework. Important Using a WSGI middleware to set these values will not work where the Python agent's own WSGI application wrapper was applied at an outer scope. In these cases you must make calls to the agent API to achieve the same outcome. Multiple environment configuration The agent reads its primary configuration from an agent config section called newrelic. You can provide overrides for specific deployment environments (for example, Development, Staging, Production) in additional sections. Preface these sections with [newrelic:environment], where environment is replaced with the name of your environment. To specify that the agent should use an environment-based configuration, use one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the environment name as the second argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT environment variable to the environment name. If no environment is specified, the agent will use the default settings as specified in the newrelic agent config section. The basic structure of the configuration file is: [newrelic] ... default settings [newrelic:development] ... override settings [newrelic:staging] ... override settings [newrelic:production] ... override settings Copy General configuration settings These settings are available in the agent configuration file. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Specifies the license key of your New Relic account. This key associates your app's metrics with your New Relic account. app_name (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Type String Default Python Application Set in Per-request option, config file, environment variable Per-request option newrelic.app_name Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic One UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon ;. Do not put a space before the semicolon, which causes the Python config parser to interpret the name as an embedded comment. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent collects performance data about your app and reports this data to our data collector. developer_mode Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE When true, the agent will instrument your web app, but will not send any actual data. In this offline mode, you will not be billed for an active agent. Use developer mode to test new versions of the agent, or test the agent against third-party packages in a developer environment. Offline mode is not a way of running the APM locally, because the metrics the agent collects are not reported anywhere. log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Sets the name of a log file, which is useful for debugging issues with the agent. This is not set by default, since the agent does not know your web app process's parent user or what directories that process has permission to write to. For detailed information, see Python agent logging. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct, and that the user that your web application runs as can write to the file. Tip Use an absolute path unless you are sure what the working directory of your application will be at startup. If you can't write out a log file, you can also use stderr and output to standard error output. This would normally result in output appearing in your web server log. log_level Type String Default info Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages, if you've set the log file location. This log_level will not affect the Python logging module log level. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are critical, error, warning, info, and debug. To report agent issues, the most useful setting is debug. However, debug generates a lot of information very quickly, so do not keep the agent at this level for longer than it takes to reproduce your problem. high_security Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data is sent to us. Enabling high security mode means that request parameters are not collected, and you cannot send raw SQL. To activate high security mode, set it to true in the local .ini configuration file and activate it in the Account Settings in the UI. For more information, see High security. proxy_scheme, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass Type Strings Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variables NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS By default, the Python agent attempts to directly connect to our servers. If there is a firewall between your host and the our collector that requires you to use an HTTP proxy, set proxy_host and proxy_port to the required values for your HTTP proxy. If proxy authentication is implemented by the HTTP proxy, also set proxy_user and proxy_pass. The proxy_scheme setting dictates what protocol scheme is used to talk to the HTTP proxy. When set to http, the agent uses a SSL tunnel through the HTTP proxy for end-to-end encryption. Instead of setting the proxy_scheme, proxy_host and proxy_port settings, you can also set the proxy_host setting to a valid URI for the proxy. Include the scheme, host, and port; for example, http://proxy-host:8000. This also works if you set the details of the HTTP proxy with the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST environment variable. Tip Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending whether ssl is disabled or enabled. If you are upgrading from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the ssl setting for backwards compatibility. As proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme, not setting proxy_scheme may result in a failure. audit_log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG Sets the name of the audit log file. If set, the agent logs details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the collector. This allows you to evaluate the security of the Python agent. Use an absolute path unless you are sure what your app's working directory will be at startup. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. Also ensure your web app's parent user can write to the file. Caution Do not use audit logging on an ongoing basis, especially in a production environment. Because the agent does not truncate or rotate the log file, the log file can grow very quickly. labels (tags) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS Adds tags. Specify name:value separated by a colon :, and separate additional tags with semicolons ;. Two tags Server:One;Data Center:Primary Copy process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. api_key Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_KEY Sets the api_key to be used with newrelic-admin record-deploy. ca_bundle_path Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 4.2.0 and newer. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T We'll record transaction traces when they exceed this threshold. The format is a number of seconds (decimal points allowed). See our glossary entry for apdex_t Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. In addition to configuring attributes for all four destinations with the general attribute settings below, they can also be configured on a per-destination basis. For more information, see Python agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes, and Attribute examples. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. Transaction tracer configuration Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. The agent automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? If enabled, the transaction tracer captures deep information about slow transactions. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Positive float or string (apdex_f) Default apdex_f Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds this threshold, the agent records a transaction trace. Valid values are any positive float, or apdex_f (four times apdex_t). transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default obfuscated Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Record SQL? When the transaction tracer is enabled, the agent can record SQL statements. The recorder has three modes: off (sends no SQL), raw (sends the SQL statement in its original form), and obfuscated (strips out numeric and string literals). Most web frameworks (including Django) parameterize SQL queries so they do not actually contain the values used to fill out the query. If you use raw mode with one of these frameworks, the Python agent will only see the SQL prior to insertion of values. The parametrized SQL will look much like obfuscated mode. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Stack trace threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack traces from SQL calls. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent captures the current stack trace. This is helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate in an application. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable SQL query plans? Determines whether the Python agent will capture query plans for slow SQL queries. Only supported in MySQL and PostgreSQL. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Query plan threshold Queries in transaction traces that exceed this threshold will report slow query data and any available explain plans. Explain plan collection will not happen if transaction_tracer.explain_enabled is false. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.function_trace Type String Default (none) Set in Config file For the specified functions or methods, the agent will capture additional function timing instrumentation. Specify these names in the form module:function or module:class.function. Transaction segment configuration Here are Transaction segment settings available via the agent configuration file. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for segments of transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to segments of transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_segments.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for segments of transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_segments.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Error collector configuration Here are error collector settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable error collection? If enabled, the error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions. error_collector.ignore_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these errors To stop collecting specific errors, set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to ignore. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip Before version 6.4.0 of the agent, this setting was named error_collector.ignore_errors. If your configuration file still uses ignore_errors, update your agent to use ignore_classes. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default 100-102 200-208 226 300-308 404 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these status codes Lists HTTP status codes which the agent should ignore rather than record as errors. List additional status codes as integers separated by spaces, and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To add one of the default codes to your allow list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option can only be set in server-side configuration in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these error class names Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to be expected. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these status codes Prevents specified HTTP status codes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. List status codes as integers separated by spaces and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To negate one of the codes in your list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python Agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless on how this configuration setting (error_collector.attributes.enabled) is set. error_collector.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file If enabled, the error collector captures event data for advanced analytics. For more information, see APM Errors. Browser monitoring settings Here are browser monitoring settings available via the agent configuration file. browser_monitoring.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables browser monitoring. For more information, see Page load timing in Python. Important Before enabling browser monitoring in the config file, enable it in the application settings in the browser monitoring UI. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file For supported Python web frameworks, this setting enables auto-insertion of the browser monitoring JavaScript fragments. browser_monitoring.content_type Type String Default text/html Set in Config file Specify the HTML Content-Type(s) that our browser monitoring agent should auto-instrument. Add additional entries in a space-separated list. Instrument xhtml+xml page responses If you are generating HTML page responses and using the Content-Type of application/xhtml+xml, you can override the allowed content types to list both this content type and the default text/html by using: browser_monitoring.content_type = text/html application/xhtml+xml Copy Important The browser monitoring JavaScript snippet prevents the page from validating as application/xhtml+xml, although the page should load and render in end-user browsers. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data which gets sent to page view events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how the configuration setting (browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled) is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Transaction events settings Here are Transaction events settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip These configuration settings used to be called analytic_events. If your configuration file still uses analytic_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. transaction_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Transaction event data allows the use of additional information such as histograms and percentiles. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_events.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_events.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in transaction events. Note that excluding attributes from transaction events does not exclude from span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events settings Here are custom events settings available via the agent configuration file. custom_insights_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Allow recording of events to the Insights custom events API via record_custom_event(). Datastore tracer settings These datastore tracer settings are available via the agent configuration file: datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are also reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects database name for some database drivers. The database name is reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. Distributed tracing settings Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Python agent version 4.2.0.100 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Settings include: distributed_tracing.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. Span event configuration Span events are collected for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Configuration options include: span_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off whether the Python agent sends spans. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off for all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this configuration setting (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Event harvest configuration Event harvest settings limit the amount of event type data sent to New Relic. When you use these settings, consider these important points: Event harvest settings affect the limits for a single instance of the agent, and not across the entire application. See the usage example below for how to set limits across an entire application. Real time streaming sends data every five seconds (12 times per minute), but the event harvest settings still affect the rate in events per minute. Enabling or disabling real time streaming does not require changing these settings. With real time streaming (enabled by default), New Relic will display the event harvest limits for entities in five second intervals. This means, for example, when you set a limit value of 1200 in the config file, you'll see it as 100 in New Relic. Usage example Let's say an application is deployed across 10 hosts, each running four processes per host. To limit the number of span events to 10,000 events per minute for the entire application, divide that number by 10 hosts. Then divide again by four processes per host. 10000 / (10 * 4) = 250 Based on that calculation, the final setting is: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data = 250 Event harvest configuration settings include: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.analytic_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for analytic events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.custom_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for custom events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Custom events are created through the Python Telemetry SDK. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data Type Integer Default 1000 Set in Config file Limit for span events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.error_event_data Type Integer Default 100 Set in Config file Limit for error events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Event loop visibility settings Important Requires Python agent version 5.0.0.124 or higher. Event loop visibility surfaces information about transactions that block the event loop. The agent will generate information about transactions that have waited a significant amount of time to acquire control of the event loop. Settings include: event_loop_visibility.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Set this to false to disable event loop information. event_loop_visibility.blocking_threshold Type Float Default 0.1 Set in Config file Threshold in seconds for how long a transaction must block the event loop before generating event loop information. Garbage collection runtime metrics settings Important Requires Python agent version 6.2.0.156 or higher. These garbage collection runtime metrics settings are available via the agent configuration file: gc_runtime_metrics.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file When enabled, the agent will generate and send garbage collection metrics. gc_runtime_metrics.top_object_count_limit Type Integer Default 5 Set in Config file The agent reports object count metrics for the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector. For each object type, this setting allows you to set the maximum number of individual metrics that will be sampled. Other configuration settings Here are assorted other settings available via the agent configuration file. utilization.detect_aws Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an AWS environment. utilization.detect_azure Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an Azure environment. utilization.detect_gcp Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Google Cloud Platform environment. utilization.detect_pcf Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment. utilization.detect_docker Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in Docker. slow_sql.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable Slow SQL? If enabled, the agent captures details from long-running SQL database queries. thread_profiler.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable thread profiler? Enables you to schedule thread profiling sessions. The thread profiler will periodically capture a snapshot of the call stack for each active thread in the application to construct a statistically representative call tree. cross_application_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables cross application tracing, which connect your apps and services within your service-oriented architecture. strip_exception_messages.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file If enabled, exception messages will be stripped from error traces before they are sent to the collector, in order to prevent the inadvertent capture of sensitive information. This option is automatically enabled in high security mode. strip_exception_messages.whitelist Type String Default (none) Set in Config file Exceptions listed in your allow list will not have their messages stripped, even if strip_exception_messages.enabled is true. The allow list is a space-separated string of exception types, each in the form of module:exception_name. List built-in exceptions as exception_name; you do not need to prepend module: to them. Example: Built-in exception and user-defined exception KeyError my_module:MyException Copy startup_timeout Type Float Default 0.0 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT By default, the agent starts when it receives the first transaction (either web or non-web). The agent then starts in parallel, ensuring that this initial request is not delayed. However, the agent does not record the details of this initial request because the agent cannot collect data until registration is complete. To override this, you can set a startup timeout in seconds. The agent will then pause the initial transaction and wait for registration to complete. Important Since startup_timeout delays your app start, we recommend only setting a startup timeout for background task queuing systems, not web applications. shutdown_timeout Type Float Default 2.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT On process shutdown, the agent attempts one final upload to the collector. To prevent the agent running indefinitely in case of an issue, the process shuts down normally if the shutdown_timeout threshold is reached. This shutdown can result in data loss, but the agent prioritizes key metric data during the upload process. For background task queuing systems, especially those which run a small number of tasks per process, you may want to increase the shutdown timeout to ensure the agent can upload all data on process shutdown. Tip The agent defaults to a 2.5 second timeout because Apache and many other web servers have a 3.0 second process termination timeout. The agent exits at 2.5 seconds to allow atexit cleanup code registered for the process to run. compressed_content_encoding Type String Default gzip Set in Config file If the data compression threshold is reached in the payload, the agent compresses data, using gzip compression by default. The config option compression_content_encoding can be set to deflate to use deflate compression. Heroku heroku.use_dyno_names Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_USE_DYNO_NAMES If true, the agent uses Heroku dyno names as the hostname. heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten Type Array Default [\"scheduler\", \"run\"] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_DYNO_NAME_PREFIXES_TO_SHORTEN Ordinarily the agent reports dyno names with a trailing dot and process ID (for example, worker.3). You can remove this trailing data by specifying the prefixes you want to report without trailing data (for example, worker). Built-in instrumentation The Python agent instruments a range of Python packages/modules. This instrumentation only occurs when the target Python package/module is imported by an application. To disable default instrumentation, provide a special import-hook section corresponding to the name of the module that triggered instrumentation. Then set the enabled setting to false to disable instrumentation of that module. Example: Disabling MySQLdb database query instrumentation Add the following to the configuration file: [import-hook:MySQLdb] enabled = false Copy",

These key-value pairs can be viewed within transaction traces in APM, traced errors in APM, transaction events in dashboards, and page views in dashboards. You can customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. These attribute settings apply to version 3.12.0 or higher of the Ruby agent. Ruby agent attributes The following table lists the attributes that can be automatically captured by the Ruby agent: httpResponseCode The response status code for a web request. Defaults: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Page views (browser monitoring): Unavailable Note: The httpResponseCode attribute (string value) is deprecated as of agent version 6.12.0. http.statusCode (integer value) should be used instead. request.headers.referer The HTTP referrer header if present (minus the query string). Defaults: Transaction traces: Disabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Disabled Page views (browser monitoring): Unavailable request.parameters.* The HTTP request parameters, associated with the transaction. Available for Rails, Sinatra, and Grape applications only. Defaults: Transaction traces: Disabled Error collector (traced errors): Disabled Transaction events: Disabled Page views (browser monitoring): Disabled Note: The capture_params property is deprecated. However, if set to true, it will enable request parameters for transaction traces and traced errors. job.resque.args.* Job arguments passed to the Resque worker. Arguments passed to Resque workers are positional. These arguments are stored as keys of the form job.resque.args.<position> where position is the index of the argument to the perform method. For example, a Resque job that takes two arguments will have keys job.resque.args.0 and job.resque.args.1. Defaults: Transaction traces: Disabled Error collector (traced errors): Disabled Transaction events: Disabled Page views (browser monitoring): Unavailable Note: The resque.capture_params property is deprecated. However, if set to true, it will enable capture of Resque arguments for transaction traces, traced errors. job.sidekiq.args.* Job arguments passed to the Sidekiq worker. Arguments passed to Sidekiq workers are positional. These arguments are stored as keys of the form job.sidekiq.args.<position> where position is the index of the argument to the perform method. For example, a Sidekiq job that takes two arguments will have keys job.sidekiq.args.0 and job.sidekiq.args.1. Defaults: Transaction traces: Disabled Error collector (traced errors): Disabled Transaction events: Disabled Page views (browser monitoring): Unavailable Note: The sidekiq.capture_params property is deprecated. However, if set to true, it will enable capture of Sidekiq arguments for transaction traces and traced errors. Adding custom attributes To capture additional custom attributes from your application, use NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_attributes. For full reference see Collecting custom attributes. Defaults: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Page views (browser monitoring): Disabled Caution If you want to query your custom parameters or attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms for naming them.

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Retrieve data from New Relic. Send data to New Relic. Adjust settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our API endpoints. For developer-focused content on how to use and customize New Relic, see developer.newrelic.com. Tip To use APIs and SDKs, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL-format API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph is the preferred API for querying New Relic data and making a range of feature configurations. To get started, see Introduction to NerdGraph. REST APIs by capability New Relic capabilities, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, or alerts, are often used together, and sometimes they overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Tip To learn more about different API key types, see Understand New Relic API keys. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use the Query API. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The Browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the Browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To retrieve browser monitoring data, use the Query API. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To retrieve infrastructure data, use the Query API. This API can also be used to retrieve subscription usage data. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To retrieve Mobile data from New Relic, use the Query API. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To retrieve synthetics event data, use the Query API. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Telemetry APIs for core data types We offer several APIs that allow you to get our core data types (metrics, logs, traces, and events) into New Relic without the use of an installed agent. Data type Description Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic. Event API Send event data to New Relic. Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage You can use the Query API to retrieve subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API To retrieve information about your New Relic partner account, sub-accounts, and users, use the Partner API. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API To query your data using NRQL-format queries, you can use the Query API. Note that this API is deprecated and NerdGraph is preferred for querying your data. Dashboard API See the Insights Dashboard API. Plugins Use the REST API for New Relic plugins and the API Explorer to: Get a list of plugins, including their names, IDs, and GUIDs. List one or more plugin components, their output, and their metric timeslice data. Developers and New Relic partners can also use New Relic's Plugin API to write an agent in any language that can work directly with the API for plugins. This allows you to send your own metric data to our plugins and view data received from the API in New Relic. See APIs in action For more on how you as a developer can optimize your ability to solve problems using New Relic, go to developer.newrelic.com.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the Browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements To report data to Browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute Browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for Browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the Browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the Browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying Browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports Browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The Browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use Browser's SPA monitoring capabilities, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with Browser. In all cases, the Browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our SPA-enabled Browser agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend the Browser Pro agent. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, Browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the Browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The Browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To retrieve synthetics event data, use the Query API. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Telemetry APIs for core data types We offer several APIs that allow you to get our core data types (metrics, logs, traces, and events) into New Relic without the use of an installed agent. Data type Description Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic. Event API Send event data to New Relic. Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage You can use the Query API to retrieve subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API To retrieve information about your New Relic partner account, sub-accounts, and users, use the Partner API. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API To query your data using NRQL-format queries, you can use the Query API. Note that this API is deprecated and NerdGraph is preferred for querying your data. Dashboard API See the Insights Dashboard API. Plugins Use the REST API for New Relic plugins and the API Explorer to: Get a list of plugins, including their names, IDs, and GUIDs. List one or more plugin components, their output, and their metric timeslice data. Developers and New Relic partners can also use New Relic's Plugin API to write an agent in any language that can work directly with the API for plugins. This allows you to send your own metric data to our plugins and view data received from the API in New Relic.

Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the Browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the Browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying Browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports Browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The Browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use Browser's SPA monitoring capabilities, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with Browser. In all cases, the Browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our SPA-enabled Browser agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend the Browser Pro agent. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, Browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the Browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The Browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

      "body": "Running the latest version of Browser monitoring ensures you can access all Browser features and enhancements. To update to the latest version, check your version number, then follow the steps to update an APM-managed installation or to upgrade a copy/paste installation. Check your version number To verify your Browser version number: View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet. Search the page source for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-. The numbers that follow nr- are your current version. For example, js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js indicates you are running version 593 of the Browser script. The Pro+SPA agent will have the format js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1184.min.js To verify the latest version of the Browser script loader: Go to js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js . Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your Browser agent. Check deployment method Your Browser agent may have been deployed using the copy/paste method rather than injected with APM. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your Browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed Browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the Browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific Browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your Browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, use the Browser Pro + SPA endpoint, the Browser Pro endpoint, or the Browser Lite endpoint. These endpoints always point to the latest version of the script snippet. Recommendation: Use the Browser Pro or Pro + SPA loaders regardless of your Browser subscription level. These loaders are compatible with both the Pro and Lite subscription levels. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your Browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your Browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

This is intentional; any AMP data sent to the New Relic collector will be removed automatically from your browser monitoring metrics. In the meantime, you can run NRQL queries to compare your AMP page to non-AMP pages. The dashboard data provides standard performance key metrics. New Relic stores AMP events in the PageView and BrowserInteraction events. To view the AMP events, run the following NRQL queries: SELECT * FROM BrowserInteraction WHERE mobileOptimized = 'amp' SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE mobileOptimized = 'amp' Here's an example of a dashboard showing AMP event data after you install New Relic Browser's AMP JavaScript snippet into the body of your AMP pages.

Basic requirements To report data to Browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute Browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for Browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the Browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the Browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying Browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports Browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The Browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use Browser's SPA monitoring capabilities, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with Browser. In all cases, the Browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our SPA-enabled Browser agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend the Browser Pro agent. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, Browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the Browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The Browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the Browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals We now, with the release of agent version 1177, have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint This new metric, available with agent version 1163, largestContentfulPaint, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the w3c draft. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good\", between 100-300 ms considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 300 ms considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see the Browser release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), available with agent v1177, is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good\", between 0.1-0.25 considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 0.25 considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event, available with agent v1177, is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Load event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event, available with agent v1163, is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Unload event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements In addition to Browser's installation requirements, the PageViewTiming event requires Browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Browser Pro subscription. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener Browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile.

      "body": "Pages can be cached in the browser or on a server. A cached page will contain stale (previously generated) application and queue times. Contents Detecting cached pages Browser monitoring detects cached pages by comparing the total back-end time against app and queue time. When the sum of app and queue time is greater than the total back-end time, Browser monitoring assumes the page was cached and aggregates the request with app and queue times as 0. Here are some additional tips for cached pages: Java: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Node.js: By default, Node.js does not cache pages. PHP: If you have a CDN cache your dynamic pages, make sure the cache contains the page load timing instrumentation. Python: Restart your app. Ruby: Look at the header information for automatic vs. manual instrumentation. For example, if you want to ignore specific webpages, you must disable automatic browser monitoring from the user interface, and then manually instrument the webpages that you do want to be tagged.

      "body": "This document describes data privacy related to Browser monitoring and cookies, and details about the cookies themselves. Page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) creates the following cookies that Browser monitoring uses when session tracking in end-user browsers. Tip These cookies are related to Browser app monitoring. For more information about data privacy and requesting data to be deleted, see New Relic personal data requests. Data privacy and legal compliance The default Browser agent configuration does not retain any personal data as defined by common privacy laws such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). New Relic has taken steps to enable our customers who elect to process personal data in our products to do so in accordance with applicable privacy laws. Use the additional information below to help enable your compliance with such laws: Data Description IP addresses New Relic briefly collects and leverages the IP address from the end-user as part of the data collection process. The IP is captured when a connection is made between the end user's browser and the New Relic data collector. The IP address is included in the web request, much like a caller ID. New Relic uses the IP, much like you see a phone number when somebody calls you. The IP address is used as a lookup value that maps to additional details, allowing New Relic customers to diagnose performance issues. IP address lookup values include: countryCode regionCode city asn (Autonomous System Number) asnOrganization (ISP/Business/Institution) asnLatitude asnLongitude The mapping process for the IP address lookup value is typically complete within minutes, but in some extreme cases may take up to 24 hours to process. Once the mapping process is complete, New Relic no longer retains the IP address. Default cookies The Browser monitoring agent sets cookies by default. Cookies are placed by the Browser agent and the New Relic collector. The New Relic collector places a cookie when the Browser agent makes a connection and transmits data. A cookie consent manager that uses a conditional script loader that only loads tags/snippets when a visitor agrees to a specific type of cookies can be used. By choosing this option there is a risk that page performance will not be captured until the visitor has agreed and the Browser agent is running. With the release of Browser agent v1169, you can turn off cookie collection (JSESSIONID and NREUM) for your Browser app by using the Application settings page in the New Relic UI. Once this configuration value is set to false (OFF), you will no longer see the session information in your event data. By default, the value is set to true (ON) for all existing Browser apps as well as newly created ones. For more information, see our documentation about cookie collection and session tracking. Personal data through custom Browser configuration New Relic offers the option to manually configure your agent through the Browser monitoring API. This could be used to capture personal data, subject to the restrictions set forth in the Terms of Service with New Relic. (For example, no credit card numbers or sensitive categories of personal data, which are contractually prohibited.) New Relic responds to the instructions specified by the agents, including collecting personal data that may be custom configured. If you (as the data controller) receive a request from one of your own customers and determine that personal data sent to New Relic for processing must be deleted, see New Relic personal data requests. JSESSIONID The JSESSIONID cookie is used to store a session identifier so that New Relic can monitor session counts for an application. The cookie value is generated by Jetty. Components Description Session identifier This is used by New Relic to monitor session counts for an application. Domain The JSESSIONID cookie is associated with the New Relic domain. Expiration JSESSIONID is a session cookie that is deleted when the browser closes. NREUM This cookie is only created in browsers that do not support the Navigation Timing API. When a browser supports the Navigation Timing API, a native interface can be used to determine navigation start time. Mozilla Firefox versions 7 or higher support the Navigation Timing API. However, a bug exists in Firefox's early implementations of the Navigation Timing API that Browser monitoring works around by using this cookie. Components Description Navigation start time Navigation start time is required to measure end user response time. The cookie is written when the current page unloads (as the next navigation begins). Document location Stored as a hash. The document location is used with the referring page URL to validate that the start time refers to the page that was previously being viewed or refreshed (to avoid using an invalid start time from a different navigation). Referring page URLs Stored as a hash. The referring page URL is used with the document location to validate that the start time refers to the page that was previously being viewed or refreshed (to avoid using an invalid start time from a different navigation). Domain The NREUM cookie is associated with the root path of the domain in which the New Relic agent executes. Expiration NREUM is a session cookie that is deleted when the browser closes. NRAGENT The NRAGENT cookie is set only if you use Browser agent version v443 or lower. It is created when a token is handed out to an end user by the New Relic collector. End-user metrics are communicated to New Relic collectors via a JSONP request from the browser (script retrieval). The returned JavaScript contains a call to set the token identifier which is written to the cookie on the next navigation (when the page unloads). This achieves a cross-domain communication between the New Relic collector and the New Relic agent. This cookie is used to communicate between the New Relic collector aggregating end user metrics and the agent(s) running in the associated web application. A token identifies and correlates application tier transaction traces with corresponding browser traces. Components Description Token identifier The 16-character token identifier helps with cross-domain communication between the New Relic collector and the New Relic agent. Domain The NRAGENT cookie is associated with the root path of the domain in which the New Relic agent executes. Expiration NRAGENT is a session cookie that is deleted when the browser closes.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the Browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals We now, with the release of agent version 1177, have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint This new metric, available with agent version 1163, largestContentfulPaint, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the w3c draft. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good\", between 100-300 ms considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 300 ms considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see the Browser release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), available with agent v1177, is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good\", between 0.1-0.25 considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 0.25 considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event, available with agent v1177, is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Load event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event, available with agent v1163, is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Unload event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements In addition to Browser's installation requirements, the PageViewTiming event requires Browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Browser Pro subscription. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener Browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile.

      "body": "Pages can be cached in the browser or on a server. A cached page will contain stale (previously generated) application and queue times. Contents Detecting cached pages Browser monitoring detects cached pages by comparing the total back-end time against app and queue time. When the sum of app and queue time is greater than the total back-end time, Browser monitoring assumes the page was cached and aggregates the request with app and queue times as 0. Here are some additional tips for cached pages: Java: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Node.js: By default, Node.js does not cache pages. PHP: If you have a CDN cache your dynamic pages, make sure the cache contains the page load timing instrumentation. Python: Restart your app. Ruby: Look at the header information for automatic vs. manual instrumentation. For example, if you want to ignore specific webpages, you must disable automatic browser monitoring from the user interface, and then manually instrument the webpages that you do want to be tagged.

      "body": "Running the latest version of Browser monitoring ensures you can access all Browser features and enhancements. To update to the latest version, check your version number, then follow the steps to update an APM-managed installation or to upgrade a copy/paste installation. Check your version number To verify your Browser version number: View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet. Search the page source for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-. The numbers that follow nr- are your current version. For example, js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js indicates you are running version 593 of the Browser script. The Pro+SPA agent will have the format js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1184.min.js To verify the latest version of the Browser script loader: Go to js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js . Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your Browser agent. Check deployment method Your Browser agent may have been deployed using the copy/paste method rather than injected with APM. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your Browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed Browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the Browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific Browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your Browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, use the Browser Pro + SPA endpoint, the Browser Pro endpoint, or the Browser Lite endpoint. These endpoints always point to the latest version of the script snippet. Recommendation: Use the Browser Pro or Pro + SPA loaders regardless of your Browser subscription level. These loaders are compatible with both the Pro and Lite subscription levels. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your Browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your Browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The configuration options explained below refer only to the browser agent, and should not to be confused with the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your agent: Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available.

      "body": "Problem You are not seeing AJAX data for your Browser application. Solution If your application is instrumented with Browser monitoring and is correctly collecting other Browser Pro data, follow these steps: 1. Verify you use XMLHttpRequest. Check whether your application uses the XMLHttpRequest object to make AJAX calls. Browser monitoring: Other methods (including the newer Fetch API) currently are not supported when using New Relic Browser Pro. Single-page app monitoring: Fetch is supported for AJAX requests within a Browser Interaction when using New Relic's SPA monitoring. If you are making requests using JSONP, see JSONP requirements. 2. Verify the object is instrumented. If you are using XMLHttpRequest, use your browser's dev console to verify that the object has been instrumented by New Relic. Enter the object name at your console. If instrumentation has succeeded, the console should return something like: function (t){var e=new p(t);try{u.emit(\"new-xhr\"... Copy If instrumentation failed, you will see something like: function XMLHttpRequest() { [native_code] } Copy If you see this type of failure response, see Troubleshooting Browser monitoring installation. If you see a different response, you may be using another script or library that is conflicting with New Relic instrumentation. Contact support at support.newrelic.com. 3. Verify network access. If the object is properly instrumented, try triggering an AJAX call in your application while monitoring network traffic in the browser's developer tools. Wait up to one minute, and look for a call to bam.nr-data.net/jserrors with an xhr parameter. If the call fails, check for network issues. If you don't see this call, if it fails with an error not related to network access, or if it succeeds but you still aren't seeing data, get support at support.newrelic.com. If your requests use JSONP, see requirements and notes on functionality below: JSONP requirements If your requests use JSONP, these requests will not appear on the AJAX UI page. However, you can view them as assets within Browser's session traces. If using SPA monitoring, you can view them on the Breakdown tab of the Page views page. Requirements for JSONP to be recognized by Browser: Each JSONP request must use a unique callback function. Most popular libraries (e.g. jQuery) generate a unique callback function dynamically for each request. The query string callback must be named \"callback\" or \"cb\" in order to be recognized by New Relic. This is the default behavior in most popular libraries.

DistributedTraceSummary MobileRequest MobileRequestError Span Transaction TransactionError InfrastructureEvent Data sources : InfrastructureCloudTrail InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, Infrastructure will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. Attribute name Definition Events category A New Relic category used to organize events in the UI. For example: automation, notification, and service. InfrastructureEvent changeType A simple classification of the type of change made to the entity: added, modified, or removed. InfrastructureEvent changedPath The fully specified name of the item that changed. This is constructed by taking the source and adding one or more additional path elements that uniquely identify the item that changed. InfrastructureEvent deltaId Delta refers to a recorded change in the system. The deltaId is a number used by New Relic to organize incoming inventory change data. InfrastructureEvent eventId The unique ID of the event, generated by New Relic. InfrastructureEvent format The type of infrastructure event. Each format type includes attributes that may be used to render the event in the UI. InfrastructureEvent newStatus The new agent status: disconnected or connected. InfrastructureEvent newValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the new value of the inventory that was changed. This will have no value if no change has been made. The value will display approximately 4K bytes of data. InfrastructureEvent oldValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the old value of the inventory that was changed. This will be blank if no change has been made. InfrastructureEvent provider For integrations that use generic event types (like the DatastoreSample event), the provider value specifies the source of the data (the service, or a sub-category of data from that service). Some Insights events are generic and are used by several integrations. For example, the DatastoreSample event is used by several integrations, including the AWS DynamoDB integration and the AWS RDS integration. In these cases, the provider attribute value represents the source of that attribute. This will usually be the service that data comes from or, for integrations that use several provider values, a certain sub-category of data from that service. When a provider value is present for a generic event, that event will have additional integration-specific attributes attached to it. Here’s an example of an Insights NRQL query that returns the attributes present for a DatastoreSample event reported by the AWS RDS integration: SELECT * from DatastoreSample where provider = 'RdsDbCluster' InfrastructureEvent source The fully specified origin of this inventory item. This is typically in the form category/plugin, where plugin is the generic word used for the tool that gathered this data. InfrastructureEvent summary A summary of the change that happened. Uses a human-friendly string, such as Agent disconnected. InfrastructureEvent violationUpdateType The type of change to the violation: For example: open or closed.

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the Browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements To report data to Browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute Browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for Browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the Browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the Browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying Browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports Browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The Browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use Browser's SPA monitoring capabilities, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with Browser. In all cases, the Browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our SPA-enabled Browser agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend the Browser Pro agent. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, Browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the Browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The Browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

      "body": "Running the latest version of Browser monitoring ensures you can access all Browser features and enhancements. To update to the latest version, check your version number, then follow the steps to update an APM-managed installation or to upgrade a copy/paste installation. Check your version number To verify your Browser version number: View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet. Search the page source for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-. The numbers that follow nr- are your current version. For example, js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js indicates you are running version 593 of the Browser script. The Pro+SPA agent will have the format js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1184.min.js To verify the latest version of the Browser script loader: Go to js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js . Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your Browser agent. Check deployment method Your Browser agent may have been deployed using the copy/paste method rather than injected with APM. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your Browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed Browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the Browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific Browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your Browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, use the Browser Pro + SPA endpoint, the Browser Pro endpoint, or the Browser Lite endpoint. These endpoints always point to the latest version of the script snippet. Recommendation: Use the Browser Pro or Pro + SPA loaders regardless of your Browser subscription level. These loaders are compatible with both the Pro and Lite subscription levels. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your Browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your Browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

Sort options allow you to view details by percentage of page load time, average page load time, or throughput. Detailed information about the top webpages viewed, timing and throughput details, and links to browser traces or session traces also are available as applicable. Browser also offers single-page app (SPA) monitoring. If you have opted in to SPA monitoring, your SPA Page views page will be different. View summary information Browser monitoring lists page views as URLs. This makes it easy to identify specific front-end page views; for example, /browse/plans. In addition: For browser apps that are also monitored by APM, you can view the back-end transactions associated with the page view; for example, ApplicationsController#Show. For URLs that are also monitored by Synthetics, you can use New Relic's comparative charting feature. This provides a direct page load time comparison between real user (Browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetics monitors. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views: This page provides detailed information about page load time, throughput, top transactions, and traces. To view detailed information about which pages the end users are viewing for your app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Select the time period or sort order, or keep the defaults. If available, select the type of view for page load timing information as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile. To view summary information about a specific transaction, mouse over the transaction's name on the list. To compare page load time between real user (Browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors, select a page monitored by Synthetics, then examine additional comparative charting details. Examine timing details for page loads The Browser page load time chart view shows the average page load time broken down into segments. This chart also appears on the Browser Summary page and Browsers detail page. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views: The Browser page load time chart shows the average page load time broken down into segments indicating the end users' experience (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). The page load timing process shows colored-coded details: Page load timing process Description Request queuing (black) Wait time between the web server and the application code. Large numbers indicate a busy application server. Web application (purple) Time spent in the application code. Network (brown) The network latency, or the time it takes for a request to make a round trip over the Internet. For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. DOM processing (yellow) In the browser, parsing and interpreting the HTML. Measured by the browser's DOMContent event. Page rendering (blue) In the browser, the time to display the HTML, run the inline JavaScript, and load images. Measured by the browser's Load event. \"Additional\" timing data If you are using the JavaScript API, your \"additional\" timing data appears in this chart. Examine page view details Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. In addition, to view details about a specific page view, select its name from the list. To close an individual page view and return to the Page views page, select X (Close). Each page view listed in the list may include links to additional drill-down details: Page view details Comments Page load performance This includes page load timing breakdown data, throughput, session traces, and browser traces (if available).

These key-value pairs can be viewed within transaction traces in APM, traced errors in APM, transaction events in dashboards, and page views in dashboards. You can customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. These attribute settings apply to version 3.12.0 or higher of the Ruby agent. Ruby agent attributes The following table lists the attributes that can be automatically captured by the Ruby agent: httpResponseCode The response status code for a web request. Defaults: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Page views (browser monitoring): Unavailable Note: The httpResponseCode attribute (string value) is deprecated as of agent version 6.12.0. http.statusCode (integer value) should be used instead. request.headers.referer The HTTP referrer header if present (minus the query string).

You can customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. These attribute settings apply to version 3.12.0 or higher of the Ruby agent. Ruby agent attributes The following table lists the attributes that can be automatically captured by the Ruby agent: httpResponseCode The response status code for a web request. Defaults: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Page views (browser monitoring): Unavailable Note: The httpResponseCode attribute (string value) is deprecated as of agent version 6.12.0. http.statusCode (integer value) should be used instead. request.headers.referer The HTTP referrer header if present (minus the query string). Defaults: Transaction traces: Disabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Disabled Page views (browser monitoring): Unavailable request.parameters.* The HTTP request parameters, associated with the transaction. Available for Rails, Sinatra, and Grape applications only. Defaults: Transaction traces: Disabled Error collector (traced errors): Disabled Transaction events: Disabled Page views (browser monitoring): Disabled Note: The capture_params property is deprecated. However, if set to true, it will enable request parameters for transaction traces and traced errors. job.resque.args.* Job arguments passed to the Resque worker. Arguments passed to Resque workers are positional. These arguments are stored as keys of the form job.resque.args.<position> where position is the index of the argument to the perform method. For example, a Resque job that takes two arguments will have keys job.resque.args.0 and job.resque.args.1. Defaults: Transaction traces: Disabled Error collector (traced errors): Disabled Transaction events: Disabled Page views (browser monitoring): Unavailable Note: The resque.capture_params property is deprecated. However, if set to true, it will enable capture of Resque arguments for transaction traces, traced errors. job.sidekiq.args.* Job arguments passed to the Sidekiq worker. Arguments passed to Sidekiq workers are positional. These arguments are stored as keys of the form job.sidekiq.args.<position> where position is the index of the argument to the perform method. For example, a Sidekiq job that takes two arguments will have keys job.sidekiq.args.0 and job.sidekiq.args.1. Defaults: Transaction traces: Disabled Error collector (traced errors): Disabled Transaction events: Disabled Page views (browser monitoring): Unavailable Note: The sidekiq.capture_params property is deprecated. However, if set to true, it will enable capture of Sidekiq arguments for transaction traces and traced errors. Adding custom attributes To capture additional custom attributes from your application, use NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_attributes. For full reference see Collecting custom attributes. Defaults: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Page views (browser monitoring): Disabled Caution If you want to query your custom parameters or attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms for naming them. Upgrading the Ruby agent When upgrading to Ruby agent 3.12.0 or higher, upgrade your newrelic.yml configuration.

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description This API call sends a Browser PageAction event with your user-defined name and optional attributes to dashboards, along with several default attributes. This is useful to track any event that is not already tracked automatically by the Browser agent, such as clicking a Subscribe button or accessing a tutorial. PageAction events are sent to New Relic One every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 60 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 60-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that harvest cycle. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name or category of the action. Reports to New Relic One as the actionName attribute. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute or value. $attributes JSON object Optional. JSON object with one or more key/value pairs. For example: {key:\"value\"}. The key will report to New Relic One as its own PageAction attribute with the specified values. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Record link clicks (JavaScript) This example records a PageAction event whenever a user selects the Try Me link. The event is recorded with an actionName of clickedTryMe: < a href=\"/demo\" id=\"try-me\" >Try Me!< /a> <script> document.getElementById('try-me').addEventListener('click',function (e) { newrelic.addPageAction('clickedTryMe'); }) </script> Copy You can then query the number of times the Try Me button was clicked with the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='clickedTryMe' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Record link clicks (jQuery) This example sends a PageAction event when a user clicks on an element with the class copy-text. The actionName is copy-text-button and the value is reported as another attribute called Result that corresponds to methods named success and error that handle the outcome. $('.copy-text').click(function (){ var clipboard = new Clipboard ('.copy-text'); clipboard.on('success', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'success'}); } }); clipboard.on('error', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'error'}); } }); }); Copy Then in the query builder, you can create a pie chart to see the breakdown of how many button clicks resulted in success versus error over the past 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET result SINCE 30 days ago Copy Or you can create a query to see what pages have the most copy button clicks in the last 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET currentUrl SINCE 30 days ago Copy Capture form input This example captures user input (email addresses) from a form called Signup. The event is recorded with an actionName of userSignup: <form action=\"/signup\" id=\"myform\"> <input id=\"email\" name=\"email\"> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Signup\"> </form> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> document.getElementById('myform').addEventListener('submit', function (e) { var email = e.target.elements['email'].value; newrelic.addPageAction('userSignup', {email: email}); }) </script> Copy You can then see the emails that you gathered with the following NRQL query: SELECT uniques(email) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='userSignup' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy",

For example: myInteraction = newrelic.interaction() myInteraction.save() Copy The named handle can be saved and used from outside an interaction, but methods will have no effect after the interaction has ended.",

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description This API call sends a Browser PageAction event with your user-defined name and optional attributes to dashboards, along with several default attributes. This is useful to track any event that is not already tracked automatically by the Browser agent, such as clicking a Subscribe button or accessing a tutorial. PageAction events are sent to New Relic One every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 60 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 60-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that harvest cycle. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name or category of the action. Reports to New Relic One as the actionName attribute. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute or value. $attributes JSON object Optional. JSON object with one or more key/value pairs. For example: {key:\"value\"}. The key will report to New Relic One as its own PageAction attribute with the specified values. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Record link clicks (JavaScript) This example records a PageAction event whenever a user selects the Try Me link. The event is recorded with an actionName of clickedTryMe: < a href=\"/demo\" id=\"try-me\" >Try Me!< /a> <script> document.getElementById('try-me').addEventListener('click',function (e) { newrelic.addPageAction('clickedTryMe'); }) </script> Copy You can then query the number of times the Try Me button was clicked with the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='clickedTryMe' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Record link clicks (jQuery) This example sends a PageAction event when a user clicks on an element with the class copy-text. The actionName is copy-text-button and the value is reported as another attribute called Result that corresponds to methods named success and error that handle the outcome. $('.copy-text').click(function (){ var clipboard = new Clipboard ('.copy-text'); clipboard.on('success', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'success'}); } }); clipboard.on('error', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'error'}); } }); }); Copy Then in the query builder, you can create a pie chart to see the breakdown of how many button clicks resulted in success versus error over the past 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET result SINCE 30 days ago Copy Or you can create a query to see what pages have the most copy button clicks in the last 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET currentUrl SINCE 30 days ago Copy Capture form input This example captures user input (email addresses) from a form called Signup.

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description This API call sends a Browser PageAction event with your user-defined name and optional attributes to dashboards, along with several default attributes. This is useful to track any event that is not already tracked automatically by the Browser agent, such as clicking a Subscribe button or accessing a tutorial. PageAction events are sent to New Relic One every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 60 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 60-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that harvest cycle. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name or category of the action. Reports to New Relic One as the actionName attribute. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute or value. $attributes JSON object Optional. JSON object with one or more key/value pairs. For example: {key:\"value\"}. The key will report to New Relic One as its own PageAction attribute with the specified values. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Record link clicks (JavaScript) This example records a PageAction event whenever a user selects the Try Me link. The event is recorded with an actionName of clickedTryMe: < a href=\"/demo\" id=\"try-me\" >Try Me!< /a> <script> document.getElementById('try-me').addEventListener('click',function (e) { newrelic.addPageAction('clickedTryMe'); }) </script> Copy You can then query the number of times the Try Me button was clicked with the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='clickedTryMe' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Record link clicks (jQuery) This example sends a PageAction event when a user clicks on an element with the class copy-text. The actionName is copy-text-button and the value is reported as another attribute called Result that corresponds to methods named success and error that handle the outcome. $('.copy-text').click(function (){ var clipboard = new Clipboard ('.copy-text'); clipboard.on('success', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'success'}); } }); clipboard.on('error', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'error'}); } }); }); Copy Then in the query builder, you can create a pie chart to see the breakdown of how many button clicks resulted in success versus error over the past 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET result SINCE 30 days ago Copy Or you can create a query to see what pages have the most copy button clicks in the last 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET currentUrl SINCE 30 days ago Copy Capture form input This example captures user input (email addresses) from a form called Signup.

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description This API call sends a Browser PageAction event with your user-defined name and optional attributes to dashboards, along with several default attributes. This is useful to track any event that is not already tracked automatically by the Browser agent, such as clicking a Subscribe button or accessing a tutorial. PageAction events are sent to New Relic One every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 60 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 60-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that harvest cycle. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name or category of the action. Reports to New Relic One as the actionName attribute. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute or value. $attributes JSON object Optional. JSON object with one or more key/value pairs. For example: {key:\"value\"}. The key will report to New Relic One as its own PageAction attribute with the specified values. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Record link clicks (JavaScript) This example records a PageAction event whenever a user selects the Try Me link. The event is recorded with an actionName of clickedTryMe: < a href=\"/demo\" id=\"try-me\" >Try Me!< /a> <script> document.getElementById('try-me').addEventListener('click',function (e) { newrelic.addPageAction('clickedTryMe'); }) </script> Copy You can then query the number of times the Try Me button was clicked with the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='clickedTryMe' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Record link clicks (jQuery) This example sends a PageAction event when a user clicks on an element with the class copy-text. The actionName is copy-text-button and the value is reported as another attribute called Result that corresponds to methods named success and error that handle the outcome. $('.copy-text').click(function (){ var clipboard = new Clipboard ('.copy-text'); clipboard.on('success', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'success'}); } }); clipboard.on('error', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'error'}); } }); }); Copy Then in the query builder, you can create a pie chart to see the breakdown of how many button clicks resulted in success versus error over the past 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET result SINCE 30 days ago Copy Or you can create a query to see what pages have the most copy button clicks in the last 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET currentUrl SINCE 30 days ago Copy Capture form input This example captures user input (email addresses) from a form called Signup.

Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. $value string OR integer Required. Value of the attribute. Appears as the value in the named attribute column in the PageView event. It will appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Custom attribute values cannot be complex objects, only simple types such as Strings and Integers. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Get JavaScript/jQuery for HTML elements This example uses JavaScript/jQuery to get the values of the following HTML elements on the Drupal-generated pages for New Relic's Docs site: <link rel=\"shortlink\" href=\"/node/1111\" /> <h1>Using NRQL</h1> New Relic reports them as custom attributes.

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description This API call sends a Browser PageAction event with your user-defined name and optional attributes to dashboards, along with several default attributes. This is useful to track any event that is not already tracked automatically by the Browser agent, such as clicking a Subscribe button or accessing a tutorial. PageAction events are sent to New Relic One every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 60 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 60-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that harvest cycle. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name or category of the action. Reports to New Relic One as the actionName attribute. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute or value. $attributes JSON object Optional. JSON object with one or more key/value pairs. For example: {key:\"value\"}. The key will report to New Relic One as its own PageAction attribute with the specified values. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Record link clicks (JavaScript) This example records a PageAction event whenever a user selects the Try Me link.

To view or log errors for a custom attribute via API, use the Browser API's noticeError call. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name of the attribute. Appears as column in the PageView event. It will also appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. $value string OR integer Required. Value of the attribute. Appears as the value in the named attribute column in the PageView event. It will appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Custom attribute values cannot be complex objects, only simple types such as Strings and Integers. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Get JavaScript/jQuery for HTML elements This example uses JavaScript/jQuery to get the values of the following HTML elements on the Drupal-generated pages for New Relic's Docs site: <link rel=\"shortlink\" href=\"/node/1111\" /> <h1>Using NRQL</h1> New Relic reports them as custom attributes. This is useful to query PageView and PageAction events in New Relic One. var node_id = ''; node_id= jQuery(\"link[rel='shortlink']\").attr(\"href\"); var node_title = ''; node_title= jQuery('h1').text(); if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.setCustomAttribute('nodeId', node_id); newrelic.setCustomAttribute('title', node_title); } Copy",

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description This API call sends a Browser PageAction event with your user-defined name and optional attributes to dashboards, along with several default attributes. This is useful to track any event that is not already tracked automatically by the Browser agent, such as clicking a Subscribe button or accessing a tutorial. PageAction events are sent to New Relic One every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 60 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 60-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that harvest cycle. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name or category of the action. Reports to New Relic One as the actionName attribute. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute or value. $attributes JSON object Optional. JSON object with one or more key/value pairs. For example: {key:\"value\"}. The key will report to New Relic One as its own PageAction attribute with the specified values. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Record link clicks (JavaScript) This example records a PageAction event whenever a user selects the Try Me link. The event is recorded with an actionName of clickedTryMe: < a href=\"/demo\" id=\"try-me\" >Try Me!< /a> <script> document.getElementById('try-me').addEventListener('click',function (e) { newrelic.addPageAction('clickedTryMe'); }) </script> Copy You can then query the number of times the Try Me button was clicked with the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='clickedTryMe' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Record link clicks (jQuery) This example sends a PageAction event when a user clicks on an element with the class copy-text. The actionName is copy-text-button and the value is reported as another attribute called Result that corresponds to methods named success and error that handle the outcome. $('.copy-text').click(function (){ var clipboard = new Clipboard ('.copy-text'); clipboard.on('success', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'success'}); } }); clipboard.on('error', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'error'}); } }); }); Copy Then in the query builder, you can create a pie chart to see the breakdown of how many button clicks resulted in success versus error over the past 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET result SINCE 30 days ago Copy Or you can create a query to see what pages have the most copy button clicks in the last 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET currentUrl SINCE 30 days ago Copy Capture form input This example captures user input (email addresses) from a form called Signup.

If you are using SPA monitoring with a compatible agent version, attributes set with this call will also be included in newrelic.interaction events. However, attributes set using the SPA API will take precedence over these attributes. Errors for custom attributes will be included in events on the JS Errors page. To view or log errors for a custom attribute via API, use the Browser API's noticeError call. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name of the attribute. Appears as column in the PageView event. It will also appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. $value string OR integer Required. Value of the attribute. Appears as the value in the named attribute column in the PageView event. It will appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Custom attribute values cannot be complex objects, only simple types such as Strings and Integers. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Get JavaScript/jQuery for HTML elements This example uses JavaScript/jQuery to get the values of the following HTML elements on the Drupal-generated pages for New Relic's Docs site: <link rel=\"shortlink\" href=\"/node/1111\" /> <h1>Using NRQL</h1> New Relic reports them as custom attributes.

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description The Browser API call adds a user-defined attribute name and value to subsequent events on the page. Make this call before the window load event fires (when that data is transmitted) in order for the attributes to be included in the PageView event. Once an attribute is set, New Relic One records it with all PageAction events until the page is reloaded or the attribute is manually unset. If you are using SPA monitoring with a compatible agent version, attributes set with this call will also be included in newrelic.interaction events. However, attributes set using the SPA API will take precedence over these attributes. Errors for custom attributes will be included in events on the JS Errors page. To view or log errors for a custom attribute via API, use the Browser API's noticeError call. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name of the attribute. Appears as column in the PageView event. It will also appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. $value string OR integer Required. Value of the attribute. Appears as the value in the named attribute column in the PageView event. It will appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Custom attribute values cannot be complex objects, only simple types such as Strings and Integers. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value.

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description This API call sends a Browser PageAction event with your user-defined name and optional attributes to dashboards, along with several default attributes. This is useful to track any event that is not already tracked automatically by the Browser agent, such as clicking a Subscribe button or accessing a tutorial. PageAction events are sent to New Relic One every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 60 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 60-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that harvest cycle. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name or category of the action. Reports to New Relic One as the actionName attribute. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute or value. $attributes JSON object Optional. JSON object with one or more key/value pairs. For example: {key:\"value\"}. The key will report to New Relic One as its own PageAction attribute with the specified values. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Record link clicks (JavaScript) This example records a PageAction event whenever a user selects the Try Me link. The event is recorded with an actionName of clickedTryMe: < a href=\"/demo\" id=\"try-me\" >Try Me!< /a> <script> document.getElementById('try-me').addEventListener('click',function (e) { newrelic.addPageAction('clickedTryMe'); }) </script> Copy You can then query the number of times the Try Me button was clicked with the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='clickedTryMe' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Record link clicks (jQuery) This example sends a PageAction event when a user clicks on an element with the class copy-text. The actionName is copy-text-button and the value is reported as another attribute called Result that corresponds to methods named success and error that handle the outcome. $('.copy-text').click(function (){ var clipboard = new Clipboard ('.copy-text'); clipboard.on('success', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'success'}); } }); clipboard.on('error', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'error'}); } }); }); Copy Then in the query builder, you can create a pie chart to see the breakdown of how many button clicks resulted in success versus error over the past 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET result SINCE 30 days ago Copy Or you can create a query to see what pages have the most copy button clicks in the last 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET currentUrl SINCE 30 days ago Copy Capture form input This example captures user input (email addresses) from a form called Signup.

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description The Browser API call adds a user-defined attribute name and value to subsequent events on the page. Make this call before the window load event fires (when that data is transmitted) in order for the attributes to be included in the PageView event. Once an attribute is set, New Relic One records it with all PageAction events until the page is reloaded or the attribute is manually unset. If you are using SPA monitoring with a compatible agent version, attributes set with this call will also be included in newrelic.interaction events. However, attributes set using the SPA API will take precedence over these attributes. Errors for custom attributes will be included in events on the JS Errors page. To view or log errors for a custom attribute via API, use the Browser API's noticeError call. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name of the attribute. Appears as column in the PageView event. It will also appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. $value string OR integer Required. Value of the attribute. Appears as the value in the named attribute column in the PageView event. It will appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Custom attribute values cannot be complex objects, only simple types such as Strings and Integers. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Get JavaScript/jQuery for HTML elements This example uses JavaScript/jQuery to get the values of the following HTML elements on the Drupal-generated pages for New Relic's Docs site: <link rel=\"shortlink\" href=\"/node/1111\" /> <h1>Using NRQL</h1> New Relic reports them as custom attributes. This is useful to query PageView and PageAction events in New Relic One. var node_id = ''; node_id= jQuery(\"link[rel='shortlink']\").attr(\"href\"); var node_title = ''; node_title= jQuery('h1').text(); if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.setCustomAttribute('nodeId', node_id); newrelic.setCustomAttribute('title', node_title); } Copy",

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description This API call sends a Browser PageAction event with your user-defined name and optional attributes to dashboards, along with several default attributes. This is useful to track any event that is not already tracked automatically by the Browser agent, such as clicking a Subscribe button or accessing a tutorial. PageAction events are sent to New Relic One every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 60 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 60-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that harvest cycle. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name or category of the action. Reports to New Relic One as the actionName attribute. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute or value. $attributes JSON object Optional. JSON object with one or more key/value pairs. For example: {key:\"value\"}. The key will report to New Relic One as its own PageAction attribute with the specified values. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Record link clicks (JavaScript) This example records a PageAction event whenever a user selects the Try Me link.

Appears as column in the PageView event. It will also appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. $value string OR integer Required. Value of the attribute. Appears as the value in the named attribute column in the PageView event. It will appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Custom attribute values cannot be complex objects, only simple types such as Strings and Integers. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Get JavaScript/jQuery for HTML elements This example uses JavaScript/jQuery to get the values of the following HTML elements on the Drupal-generated pages for New Relic's Docs site: <link rel=\"shortlink\" href=\"/node/1111\" /> <h1>Using NRQL</h1> New Relic reports them as custom attributes.

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description This API call sends a Browser PageAction event with your user-defined name and optional attributes to dashboards, along with several default attributes. This is useful to track any event that is not already tracked automatically by the Browser agent, such as clicking a Subscribe button or accessing a tutorial. PageAction events are sent to New Relic One every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 60 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 60-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that harvest cycle. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name or category of the action. Reports to New Relic One as the actionName attribute. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute or value. $attributes JSON object Optional. JSON object with one or more key/value pairs. For example: {key:\"value\"}. The key will report to New Relic One as its own PageAction attribute with the specified values. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Record link clicks (JavaScript) This example records a PageAction event whenever a user selects the Try Me link. The event is recorded with an actionName of clickedTryMe: < a href=\"/demo\" id=\"try-me\" >Try Me!< /a> <script> document.getElementById('try-me').addEventListener('click',function (e) { newrelic.addPageAction('clickedTryMe'); }) </script> Copy You can then query the number of times the Try Me button was clicked with the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='clickedTryMe' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Record link clicks (jQuery) This example sends a PageAction event when a user clicks on an element with the class copy-text. The actionName is copy-text-button and the value is reported as another attribute called Result that corresponds to methods named success and error that handle the outcome. $('.copy-text').click(function (){ var clipboard = new Clipboard ('.copy-text'); clipboard.on('success', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'success'}); } }); clipboard.on('error', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'error'}); } }); }); Copy Then in the query builder, you can create a pie chart to see the breakdown of how many button clicks resulted in success versus error over the past 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET result SINCE 30 days ago Copy Or you can create a query to see what pages have the most copy button clicks in the last 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET currentUrl SINCE 30 days ago Copy Capture form input This example captures user input (email addresses) from a form called Signup.

However, attributes set using the SPA API will take precedence over these attributes. Errors for custom attributes will be included in events on the JS Errors page. To view or log errors for a custom attribute via API, use the Browser API's noticeError call. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name of the attribute. Appears as column in the PageView event. It will also appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. $value string OR integer Required. Value of the attribute. Appears as the value in the named attribute column in the PageView event. It will appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Custom attribute values cannot be complex objects, only simple types such as Strings and Integers. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Get JavaScript/jQuery for HTML elements This example uses JavaScript/jQuery to get the values of the following HTML elements on the Drupal-generated pages for New Relic's Docs site: <link rel=\"shortlink\" href=\"/node/1111\" /> <h1>Using NRQL</h1> New Relic reports them as custom attributes. This is useful to query PageView and PageAction events in New Relic One. var node_id = ''; node_id= jQuery(\"link[rel='shortlink']\").attr(\"href\"); var node_title = ''; node_title= jQuery('h1').text(); if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.setCustomAttribute('nodeId', node_id); newrelic.setCustomAttribute('title', node_title); } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic Browser's Filterable Geography page provides a world view with color-coded performance information about cities, regions, and countries anywhere around the world. You can filter and drill down into detailed information, or use your mouse to select or zoom in and out of any location on the map. The enhanced attributes provide deep visibility not only about your end users' experience with page load timing, but also with network performance anywhere around the world. This level of visual detail is especially useful for professionals in IT and Operations to make business decisions about peering agreements and CDN usage. Contents Requirements Your New Relic Browser subscription level and your time picker settings determine what data you can view: Pro or higher: As of January 2016, the Filterable Geography feature automatically appears in your New Relic Browser user interface. No special setup is required. You can view up to eight days of data. Your application must be enabled to send PageView data to New Relic Insights in order to use Filterable Geography. Lite: The Filterable Geography feature appears in your New Relic Browser's UI menu but currently is not available for use. Any subscription level: If you need to use New Relic Browser's legacy Geography feature, you can still view it from your selected browser app. Factors affecting collected data To capture page load timing information, New Relic Browser uses the Navigation Timing API, which most (but not all) browsers support. If the browsers do not support the Navigation Timing API, then New Relic Browser charts and data points can only show the network data they receive for DNS lookup, connection, secure handshake, etc. This may not be 100% of the app's overall traffic. Also, firewalls may have an impact on the geographical data collected about your end users. View performance data by location one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map before drilling down into detailed information about London, England. To view or sort the performance information by location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Select the type of performance data to view from the dropdown, or use the default Average page load time. To drill down to a specific area, mouse over or select any area on the geographical map, or select any of the ten worst performing locations from the list to the right of the map. To view specific performance metrics, select any of the attributes below the funnel icon. To view comparison data, select the Page load performance or Historical performance chart below the selected location's geographical map. Use map functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions and page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the Filterable Geography page. If you want to... Do this... Change what kind of performance data appears Select your choice from the dropdown. Default performance indicator is Average page load time. The map's legend lists the ten best or worst performing areas (depending on the selected performance indicator) for the selected time period. For example: If you select Count, the map's legend shows the top ten locations with the highest number of page loads, as well as the average page load time for each. If you select Connection setup, New Relic Browser first filters out areas with low throughput. Then the map's legend shows the top ten locations where average connection time is the slowest, as well as the average page load time and count for each. View summary performance information about a specific location Mouse over any colored area on the map, select a location from the list, or zoom in and out of any area on the map. View detailed data for a location Select any area of the map. For example: If you select Canada, the map and legend show color-coded performance data for each province and territory. The list to the right of the map shows the top ten worst performing areas. If you select a specific province or territory, the map shows color-coded performance data for the top ten cities. The map includes circled locations which you can mouse over or select to view detailed information. In addition, the Page load performance and Historical performance charts below the map automatically update with each location you select. Hide the list of available attributes Select the funnel icon. Return to a larger world view Select another location on the map, or clear the filter labels above the map. Tip To return to the original map view of the world, select any area on an ocean. Examine heat map details one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map as you use filter and zoom tools to drill down into detailed information about London, England. Athough overall throughput for the area is good (green), the nearby yellow areas, and the smaller red and orange circles indicate nearby cities with varying levels of throughput problems, not the size of those cities. The Filterable Geography heat map identifies performance quality with color and with the size of circles. Heat map Description Color scale Performance quality ranges from green (the best) to yellow, orange, and then red (the worst). When selecting indicators of usage rather than performance, the heat map shows shades of purple, with the darkest shades indicating the highest usage. The color scale adapts to your app's specific performance. Each area is a percentile range. To view the range for each color segment, mouse over the heat map's legend. Thresholds Different thresholds are dynamically applied to the colors based on the type of performance indicator you select from the dropdown and the maximum value your app has reported. For example, green for Average page load time may indicate 0 to 3.3 seconds, while green for Average network time may indicate 0 to 256 milliseconds. Circles The map's colored circles help you identify areas with performance problems at a glance. Each circle's radius is based on throughput reported for the city it represents, not the size of the city itself. You may see many circles overlapping each other. This usually indicates a grouping of metropolitan areas which represent a geographic area of heavy traffic. Filter performance metrics The Filter feature allows you to select and group data by attributes in various categories, including: Page view Geography Browser Identity Custom The filtered results appear on the geographical map, where you can use any of the standard map functions to explore additional details. Here are some examples. Unsatisfactory network performance by ASN In this example, your organization is preparing to renew a peering agreement with the owner of an autonomous system, called \"My-ASN.\" You are concerned that continued outages and other connection issues are affecting customer satisfaction with your site, and you want to compare its performance with other ASNs. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. From the performance type dropdown, select Connection setup. Select the funnel icon. To view the specific ASN's performance: From the search window, type My-ASN, and then select this name from the Filter by results. OR To compare performance with other ASNs: From Geography attributes > ASN organizations, review the performance data for each organization on the list, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filter, select the attribute name. Page rendering performance during sales promotion In this example, your organization has a special three-day sales promotion for an upcoming holiday. Your holiday-merchandise page has undergone major changes, including dozens of new images. You want to look for performance problems with page rendering on Android mobile devices during this sales period. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Use the time picker to change the date range to the promotion period. From the performance type dropdown, select Page rendering. Select the funnel icon. From Page view attributes > Page Url, select your site's holiday-merchandise page, and then select Back to groupings list. From Browser attributes > User agent OS, select Android, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filters, select their attribute names. View comparative performance details Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with comparative performance details for the selected location. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with details for the selected location. The Page load performance tab shows two charts. The Average page load time chart includes: Average page load time for each segment of the page load timing process in seconds Request queuing information (the time after a request enters your production systems and before it reaches your application) if applicable The Average network time chart shows key elements, including how long it takes for DNS lookup, connection establishment, and secure handshake, in seconds. Tip Sometimes areas on the charts may appear to be zero or near zero. This is because some apps use existing TCP connections, and they do not need to establish new connections. The Historical performance tab shows comparison data for the selected time period, yesterday, and last week for the selected location. This includes: Average response time Throughput in pages per minute (ppm) Available metrics You can filter and group geographical performance data in New Relic Browser and in New Relic Insights. Available metrics include: Performance Metrics Webpage Page load time Throughput (pages per minute or ppm) Network time Connection time Secure connection time Network Autonomous system number and name (ASN) via IP mapping SSL negotiation timing DNS timing Time to first byte ASN latitude and longitude for Internet service providers (ISPs) To ensure end user security, New Relic Browser collects GeoIP information for the end user's ISP. New Relic Browser does not collect GeoIP information for the specific end user. For example, if an end user in Portland, Oregon uses an ISP located in Beaverton, Oregon, New Relic Browser collects the GeoIP information for the ISP in Beaverton. User agents Operating systems Browser names or types Browser versions Device types Performance and usage ranges The color-coded legend shows performance and usage as percentile ranges. Performance color ranges Percentile colors for performance range from green (the best) to red (the worst). Performance percentile ranges (best to worst) Green Yellow Orange Red Back-end duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Connection setup duration 0-96.9 97-97.9 98-98.9 99+ DNS lookup duration 0-96.9 97-97.9 98-98.9 99+ DOM processing duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Network duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Page load duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Page rendering duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Queue duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Secure handshake duration 0-96.9 97-97.9 98-98.9 99+ Web app duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Usage color ranges Percentile colors for usage counts appear as shades of purple, from lightest (lowest usage) to darkest (highest usage).

Page load timing, individual asset loads, user interactions, AJAX requests, callbacks, errors, and other events appear in an interactive timeline which includes a detailed waterfall visualization, a heat map overview, and highlighted metrics and problems related to that session. Identify problems and solutions Session traces help you understand: How users experience your page load, including time to DOM load, time waiting for AJAX requests to complete, and the user's interactions with the page How the New Relic metrics reflect your end users' experiences What is the sequence of JavaScript and browser events, which take longer than others, and when each event occurs Where bottlenecks occur, and what may be causing them Why one page load may be slower than others, by providing the context for individual events during a session By connecting performance to user experience and interactions to performance, this detailed and intuitive visualization of all events in the user's session can help pinpoint problem areas and easily identify solutions. Requirements To use Browser monitoring's session traces feature, make sure you meet these requirements: Your agent version must support Browser monitoring. If you're using multiple names for an app, session traces will only report to the most specific application. For accounts older than October 2014, you must enable Browser monitoring and the enhanced Pro features. Browser randomly captures traces only from browsers that support the Resource Timing API. Select a session trace The Session traces index lists the most recent traces based on the time picker selection for the selected app. Session traces are randomly sampled and stored at a rate of 90/hour. You can page through up to 500 traces at a time. Additionally, you can sort and search the list by attributes, including: Full URL, with query string parameters removed Browser type Started at date/time Page load time one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces: You can select a session trace from the Browser index. You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors, and AJAX pages. To select a specific session trace: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > Session traces. To locate a session trace from a different date or time period, use the time picker. To limit the index to a specific type of trace, use the search window. To view detailed information, select the session trace's link. Tip You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors and AJAX pages. View session trace details The Session trace details page provides summary information about the trace, a heat map with timing details, and a waterfall of events that you can explore. The color-coded legend identifies the page load events during the webpage's life cycle. For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser monitoring includes web app and queue time in Network time as part of the page load timing process. This is because Browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the Browser agent through auto-injection. You can view detailed information about how this \"back end\" time breaks down from the browser's point of view. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser spends time on DNS lookups and other network events. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces > (select a trace): Use Browser's session trace details to examine events and identify problems during the end user's webpage session. To navigate through a session trace, explore the waterfall chart by scrolling vertically through the event stack, or select individual events to view their details. If you want to... Do this... View the web page for this session trace Select the trace link. Jump to a specific time Select the time indicator or event on the heat map. View details about individual events Select any event in the waterfall chart. From there, select View full details if applicable. Change the location on the session trace Click on the heat map, or scroll vertically through the waterfall chart. Zoom in or out of the overall trace Select the plus or minus icons below the heat map. Share the session trace information Create a permalink to paste into a form, ticket, email, etc. Session segment definitions Important session trace measurements are displayed in the upper right corner of the Session traces page. The first four measurements represent how long into a session that the segment ended. For example, if Page Load is 0.202s, that means that the page load event completed 0.202 seconds after the request began. Session segment Description Backend The time from when the request began to when backend activity finished and DOM loading began. DOM processing The time from when the request began to when DOM processing finished. Page load The time from when the request began to when the page load event fired. Waiting on AJAX The time from when the request began to when AJAX activity ended. First interaction The time from when the request began to when the first user activity, like a mouse click or a scroll, was recorded. Duration The total duration of the session. Slow JavaScript execution and repainting Session traces help you identify callbacks in your JavaScript code that execute slowly and block the execution of subsequent calls on the browser's main thread. These calls should execute quickly in order to allow the browser to quickly repaint the page in response to user actions. Session traces highlight any callbacks longer than 33ms. If called in rapid succession (such as inside a requestAnimationFrame loop), callbacks longer than 33ms reduce the frame rate below 30 frames per second. This speed seems sluggish to users.",

To see error profile details: At the bottom of the JS errors UI page, select an error profile to expand it. What are error profiles? In Browser monitoring, an error profile is a potentially meaningful correlation New Relic has found between your JavaScript error attribute values when compared to normal PageView events. These correlations help you investigate the causes and contributing factors behind your errors. The screenshot below shows an example of an error profile. This error profile shows that the distribution of the userAgentOS attribute values varies significantly when JS error events are compared to normal (non-error) page view events. To investigate further, you could use the filter to display only Windows errors and see if there are other correlations. You can also filter the data used to generate error profiles to help you narrow down potential causes. For an analysis of a specific error profile, see the example error profile explanation. Filter error profile data To further filter the data used to generate error profiles and their comparison page views, use these JS errors page features: Time picker: select a time range used to generate the data. Filter: use the filter to display only error profiles and page views that have the attribute values you choose. You can select multiple attribute values. Example error profile explanation To help you better understand your own error profile data, this is an explanation of an example error profile's data. This error profile example has had a filter of userAgentName = Chrome applied, so it is only showing error data from Chrome browsers. This example profile has had a filter applied so that it is only showing error data from Chrome browsers. Column explanations: The first column is the attribute column. It shows the attribute values with the most deviation when compared to non-error page views. Less significant attribute values are aggregated in the Other category. In this example, the Chrome versions 36, 64, and 65 make up 100% of the errors for Chrome users. The JS errors column shows what percentage of JavaScriptError events have the attribute values from the first column. This column adds up to 100%, representing all errors from the chosen time range and filter set. In this example, a large percentage of Chrome errors are coming from Chrome version 36. If we wanted to investigate this further, we could filter to only show version 36 data. The Page views column shows what percentage of PageView events have the attribute values from the first column. In this example, less than 1% of Chrome users use Chrome version 36, but 55% of errors are generated by users with that version. The Difference column shows you the difference in percentage between the JS errors column and the Page views column. In this example, the 54% indicates that attribute is 54 percentage points higher for error events than for page views.",

      "body": "New Relic Browser's Filterable Geography page provides a world view with color-coded performance information about cities, regions, and countries anywhere around the world. You can filter and drill down into detailed information, or use your mouse to select or zoom in and out of any location on the map. The enhanced attributes provide deep visibility not only about your end users' experience with page load timing, but also with network performance anywhere around the world. This level of visual detail is especially useful for professionals in IT and Operations to make business decisions about peering agreements and CDN usage. Contents Requirements Your New Relic Browser subscription level and your time picker settings determine what data you can view: Pro or higher: As of January 2016, the Filterable Geography feature automatically appears in your New Relic Browser user interface. No special setup is required. You can view up to eight days of data. Your application must be enabled to send PageView data to New Relic Insights in order to use Filterable Geography. Lite: The Filterable Geography feature appears in your New Relic Browser's UI menu but currently is not available for use. Any subscription level: If you need to use New Relic Browser's legacy Geography feature, you can still view it from your selected browser app. Factors affecting collected data To capture page load timing information, New Relic Browser uses the Navigation Timing API, which most (but not all) browsers support. If the browsers do not support the Navigation Timing API, then New Relic Browser charts and data points can only show the network data they receive for DNS lookup, connection, secure handshake, etc. This may not be 100% of the app's overall traffic. Also, firewalls may have an impact on the geographical data collected about your end users. View performance data by location one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map before drilling down into detailed information about London, England. To view or sort the performance information by location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Select the type of performance data to view from the dropdown, or use the default Average page load time. To drill down to a specific area, mouse over or select any area on the geographical map, or select any of the ten worst performing locations from the list to the right of the map. To view specific performance metrics, select any of the attributes below the funnel icon. To view comparison data, select the Page load performance or Historical performance chart below the selected location's geographical map. Use map functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions and page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the Filterable Geography page. If you want to... Do this... Change what kind of performance data appears Select your choice from the dropdown. Default performance indicator is Average page load time. The map's legend lists the ten best or worst performing areas (depending on the selected performance indicator) for the selected time period. For example: If you select Count, the map's legend shows the top ten locations with the highest number of page loads, as well as the average page load time for each. If you select Connection setup, New Relic Browser first filters out areas with low throughput. Then the map's legend shows the top ten locations where average connection time is the slowest, as well as the average page load time and count for each. View summary performance information about a specific location Mouse over any colored area on the map, select a location from the list, or zoom in and out of any area on the map. View detailed data for a location Select any area of the map. For example: If you select Canada, the map and legend show color-coded performance data for each province and territory. The list to the right of the map shows the top ten worst performing areas. If you select a specific province or territory, the map shows color-coded performance data for the top ten cities. The map includes circled locations which you can mouse over or select to view detailed information. In addition, the Page load performance and Historical performance charts below the map automatically update with each location you select. Hide the list of available attributes Select the funnel icon. Return to a larger world view Select another location on the map, or clear the filter labels above the map. Tip To return to the original map view of the world, select any area on an ocean. Examine heat map details one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map as you use filter and zoom tools to drill down into detailed information about London, England. Athough overall throughput for the area is good (green), the nearby yellow areas, and the smaller red and orange circles indicate nearby cities with varying levels of throughput problems, not the size of those cities. The Filterable Geography heat map identifies performance quality with color and with the size of circles. Heat map Description Color scale Performance quality ranges from green (the best) to yellow, orange, and then red (the worst). When selecting indicators of usage rather than performance, the heat map shows shades of purple, with the darkest shades indicating the highest usage. The color scale adapts to your app's specific performance. Each area is a percentile range. To view the range for each color segment, mouse over the heat map's legend. Thresholds Different thresholds are dynamically applied to the colors based on the type of performance indicator you select from the dropdown and the maximum value your app has reported. For example, green for Average page load time may indicate 0 to 3.3 seconds, while green for Average network time may indicate 0 to 256 milliseconds. Circles The map's colored circles help you identify areas with performance problems at a glance. Each circle's radius is based on throughput reported for the city it represents, not the size of the city itself. You may see many circles overlapping each other. This usually indicates a grouping of metropolitan areas which represent a geographic area of heavy traffic. Filter performance metrics The Filter feature allows you to select and group data by attributes in various categories, including: Page view Geography Browser Identity Custom The filtered results appear on the geographical map, where you can use any of the standard map functions to explore additional details. Here are some examples. Unsatisfactory network performance by ASN In this example, your organization is preparing to renew a peering agreement with the owner of an autonomous system, called \"My-ASN.\" You are concerned that continued outages and other connection issues are affecting customer satisfaction with your site, and you want to compare its performance with other ASNs. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. From the performance type dropdown, select Connection setup. Select the funnel icon. To view the specific ASN's performance: From the search window, type My-ASN, and then select this name from the Filter by results. OR To compare performance with other ASNs: From Geography attributes > ASN organizations, review the performance data for each organization on the list, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filter, select the attribute name. Page rendering performance during sales promotion In this example, your organization has a special three-day sales promotion for an upcoming holiday. Your holiday-merchandise page has undergone major changes, including dozens of new images. You want to look for performance problems with page rendering on Android mobile devices during this sales period. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Use the time picker to change the date range to the promotion period. From the performance type dropdown, select Page rendering. Select the funnel icon. From Page view attributes > Page Url, select your site's holiday-merchandise page, and then select Back to groupings list. From Browser attributes > User agent OS, select Android, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filters, select their attribute names. View comparative performance details Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with comparative performance details for the selected location. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with details for the selected location. The Page load performance tab shows two charts. The Average page load time chart includes: Average page load time for each segment of the page load timing process in seconds Request queuing information (the time after a request enters your production systems and before it reaches your application) if applicable The Average network time chart shows key elements, including how long it takes for DNS lookup, connection establishment, and secure handshake, in seconds. Tip Sometimes areas on the charts may appear to be zero or near zero. This is because some apps use existing TCP connections, and they do not need to establish new connections. The Historical performance tab shows comparison data for the selected time period, yesterday, and last week for the selected location. This includes: Average response time Throughput in pages per minute (ppm) Available metrics You can filter and group geographical performance data in New Relic Browser and in New Relic Insights. Available metrics include: Performance Metrics Webpage Page load time Throughput (pages per minute or ppm) Network time Connection time Secure connection time Network Autonomous system number and name (ASN) via IP mapping SSL negotiation timing DNS timing Time to first byte ASN latitude and longitude for Internet service providers (ISPs) To ensure end user security, New Relic Browser collects GeoIP information for the end user's ISP. New Relic Browser does not collect GeoIP information for the specific end user. For example, if an end user in Portland, Oregon uses an ISP located in Beaverton, Oregon, New Relic Browser collects the GeoIP information for the ISP in Beaverton. User agents Operating systems Browser names or types Browser versions Device types Performance and usage ranges The color-coded legend shows performance and usage as percentile ranges. Performance color ranges Percentile colors for performance range from green (the best) to red (the worst). Performance percentile ranges (best to worst) Green Yellow Orange Red Back-end duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Connection setup duration 0-96.9 97-97.9 98-98.9 99+ DNS lookup duration 0-96.9 97-97.9 98-98.9 99+ DOM processing duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Network duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Page load duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Page rendering duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Queue duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Secure handshake duration 0-96.9 97-97.9 98-98.9 99+ Web app duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Usage color ranges Percentile colors for usage counts appear as shades of purple, from lightest (lowest usage) to darkest (highest usage).

      "body": "Browser monitoring's session traces provide a detailed timeline of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle, for as long as ten minutes. Page load timing, individual asset loads, user interactions, AJAX requests, callbacks, errors, and other events appear in an interactive timeline which includes a detailed waterfall visualization, a heat map overview, and highlighted metrics and problems related to that session. Identify problems and solutions Session traces help you understand: How users experience your page load, including time to DOM load, time waiting for AJAX requests to complete, and the user's interactions with the page How the New Relic metrics reflect your end users' experiences What is the sequence of JavaScript and browser events, which take longer than others, and when each event occurs Where bottlenecks occur, and what may be causing them Why one page load may be slower than others, by providing the context for individual events during a session By connecting performance to user experience and interactions to performance, this detailed and intuitive visualization of all events in the user's session can help pinpoint problem areas and easily identify solutions. Requirements To use Browser monitoring's session traces feature, make sure you meet these requirements: Your agent version must support Browser monitoring. If you're using multiple names for an app, session traces will only report to the most specific application. For accounts older than October 2014, you must enable Browser monitoring and the enhanced Pro features. Browser randomly captures traces only from browsers that support the Resource Timing API. Select a session trace The Session traces index lists the most recent traces based on the time picker selection for the selected app. Session traces are randomly sampled and stored at a rate of 90/hour. You can page through up to 500 traces at a time. Additionally, you can sort and search the list by attributes, including: Full URL, with query string parameters removed Browser type Started at date/time Page load time one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces: You can select a session trace from the Browser index. You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors, and AJAX pages. To select a specific session trace: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > Session traces. To locate a session trace from a different date or time period, use the time picker. To limit the index to a specific type of trace, use the search window. To view detailed information, select the session trace's link. Tip You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors and AJAX pages. View session trace details The Session trace details page provides summary information about the trace, a heat map with timing details, and a waterfall of events that you can explore. The color-coded legend identifies the page load events during the webpage's life cycle. For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser monitoring includes web app and queue time in Network time as part of the page load timing process. This is because Browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the Browser agent through auto-injection. You can view detailed information about how this \"back end\" time breaks down from the browser's point of view. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser spends time on DNS lookups and other network events. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces > (select a trace): Use Browser's session trace details to examine events and identify problems during the end user's webpage session. To navigate through a session trace, explore the waterfall chart by scrolling vertically through the event stack, or select individual events to view their details. If you want to... Do this... View the web page for this session trace Select the trace link. Jump to a specific time Select the time indicator or event on the heat map. View details about individual events Select any event in the waterfall chart. From there, select View full details if applicable. Change the location on the session trace Click on the heat map, or scroll vertically through the waterfall chart. Zoom in or out of the overall trace Select the plus or minus icons below the heat map. Share the session trace information Create a permalink to paste into a form, ticket, email, etc. Session segment definitions Important session trace measurements are displayed in the upper right corner of the Session traces page. The first four measurements represent how long into a session that the segment ended. For example, if Page Load is 0.202s, that means that the page load event completed 0.202 seconds after the request began. Session segment Description Backend The time from when the request began to when backend activity finished and DOM loading began. DOM processing The time from when the request began to when DOM processing finished. Page load The time from when the request began to when the page load event fired. Waiting on AJAX The time from when the request began to when AJAX activity ended. First interaction The time from when the request began to when the first user activity, like a mouse click or a scroll, was recorded. Duration The total duration of the session. Slow JavaScript execution and repainting Session traces help you identify callbacks in your JavaScript code that execute slowly and block the execution of subsequent calls on the browser's main thread. These calls should execute quickly in order to allow the browser to quickly repaint the page in response to user actions. Session traces highlight any callbacks longer than 33ms. If called in rapid succession (such as inside a requestAnimationFrame loop), callbacks longer than 33ms reduce the frame rate below 30 frames per second. This speed seems sluggish to users.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring supports the uploading of source maps, which are used to un-minify error stack traces on the JS errors page. This document explains how to use the API to publish (upload) source maps to Browser. Prepare for using the source map API In order to upload source maps to Browser via the API, you'll need this information: A user API key (before November 20, 2020, the Admin API key was required; that will still work if already in place) The New Relic application ID for the deployed app The full JavaScript file URL Optionally, if the JavaScript URL doesn't automatically have release info appended to it, the release name and ID What is the JavaScript URL? Every time the agent captures an error in your code, it's associated with the URL of the JavaScript in which it occurred. This is the src attribute of the script tag in your HTML. This full JavaScript URL is required when sending source maps to Browser. You can find the URL for an error's JavaScript file in Browser, on the JS errors page. See Browser monitoring source maps for more on finding these errors in the UI. Is a release name and ID required? Many organizations include a version number or hash in the JavaScript URL. This is generally added to \"bust\" caches to ensure your users get the most recent version of your code. This type of URL might look something like: https://example.com/assets/application-59.min.js https://example.com/assets/bundle-d6d031.min.js https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.js If your app's URLs automatically have the version info appended to it, the Browser agent has everything it needs in order to match errors with your code. You can move ahead to generating source maps. If this doesn't apply to you, and JS URLs do not have version info appended, you’ll have to assist the agent by specifying a release name and ID with the API. Are there limits to source map uploads? There is no limit to the overall number of source maps you can upload. However, the API is rate-limited: You can upload a maximum of 100 source maps per minute You can upload a maximum of 5,000 source maps per day Source map files can be a maximum of 50Mb in size. Push source maps to New Relic Now that you have one or more source maps, you are ready to publish it to Browser. You can use any of these methods to send source maps to Browser: Use the New Relic npm module with the API via the command line or via a client-side JavaScript build/deploy script like Gulp or Grunt. Use API curl commands. Use the Browser UI. Use npm module via command line or client-side script The easiest and recommended way to upload source maps to Browser is to use the our new @newrelic/publish-sourcemap npm module. It provides a command line tool and Javascript API to accomplish this task. More documentation is available in the npm repo. Here are some examples of using the npm module via the command line. Important The following examples are for US accounts. For EU accounts, the endpoint is https://sourcemaps.service.eu.newrelic.com. For more information, see Introduction to the EU region data center. npm command line: Publish Here's an example of uploading source maps using the npm module via the command line. Note that the source map can come from a local file or a remote URL. npm install -g @newrelic/publish-sourcemap publish-sourcemap PATH_TO_SOURCE_MAP_FILE (local or remote) PATH_TO_ORIGINAL_FILE --apiKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY --applicationId=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID Copy npm command line: List published maps Here's an example of listing published source maps: list-sourcemaps --applicationId=YOUR_APP_ID --apiKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY Options: --applicationId Browser application id --apiKey New Relic user API key Copy npm command line: Delete Here's an example of deleting a source map: delete-sourcemap --applicationId=YOUR_APP_ID --apiKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY --sourcemapId=YOUR_SOURCE_MAP_ID Options: --applicationId Browser application id --apiKey New Relic user API key --sourcemapId Unique id generated for a source map Copy Here are some examples of using the npm module to publish from client-side JavaScript: npm via Node.js script: Publish Here's an example of publishing a source map via a Node.js script: var publishSourcemap = require(‘@newrelic/publish-sourcemap’).publishSourcemap publishSourcemap({ sourcemapPath: 'SOURCE_MAP_FULL_PATH', javascriptUrl: 'JS_URL', applicationId: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID, apiKey: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY' }, function (err) { console.log(err || 'Sourcemap upload done')}) Copy npm via Node.js script: List published maps Here's an example of listing all published source maps: var listSourcemaps = require(‘@newrelic/publish-sourcemap’).listSourcemaps listSourcemaps({ sourcemapPath: 'SOURCE_MAP_FULL_PATH', javascriptUrl: 'JS_URL', applicationId: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID, apiKey: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY', }, function (err, res) { console.log(err || res.body)}) Copy npm via Node.js script: Delete Here's an example of deleting a source map file via a Node.js script: var deleteSourcemap = require(‘@newrelic/publish-sourcemap’).deleteSourcemap deleteSourcemap({ sourcemapId: 'SOURCE_MAP_ID', applicationId: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID, apiKey: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_API_KEY', }, function (err) { console.log(err || 'Deleted source map')}) Copy When you're done, go to the JS errors page in Browser, select an error grouping, and see if your error stack traces have been un-minified.

      "body": "Browser monitoring's session traces provide a detailed timeline of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle, for as long as ten minutes. Page load timing, individual asset loads, user interactions, AJAX requests, callbacks, errors, and other events appear in an interactive timeline which includes a detailed waterfall visualization, a heat map overview, and highlighted metrics and problems related to that session. Identify problems and solutions Session traces help you understand: How users experience your page load, including time to DOM load, time waiting for AJAX requests to complete, and the user's interactions with the page How the New Relic metrics reflect your end users' experiences What is the sequence of JavaScript and browser events, which take longer than others, and when each event occurs Where bottlenecks occur, and what may be causing them Why one page load may be slower than others, by providing the context for individual events during a session By connecting performance to user experience and interactions to performance, this detailed and intuitive visualization of all events in the user's session can help pinpoint problem areas and easily identify solutions. Requirements To use Browser monitoring's session traces feature, make sure you meet these requirements: Your agent version must support Browser monitoring. If you're using multiple names for an app, session traces will only report to the most specific application. For accounts older than October 2014, you must enable Browser monitoring and the enhanced Pro features. Browser randomly captures traces only from browsers that support the Resource Timing API. Select a session trace The Session traces index lists the most recent traces based on the time picker selection for the selected app. Session traces are randomly sampled and stored at a rate of 90/hour. You can page through up to 500 traces at a time. Additionally, you can sort and search the list by attributes, including: Full URL, with query string parameters removed Browser type Started at date/time Page load time one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces: You can select a session trace from the Browser index. You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors, and AJAX pages. To select a specific session trace: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > Session traces. To locate a session trace from a different date or time period, use the time picker. To limit the index to a specific type of trace, use the search window. To view detailed information, select the session trace's link. Tip You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors and AJAX pages. View session trace details The Session trace details page provides summary information about the trace, a heat map with timing details, and a waterfall of events that you can explore. The color-coded legend identifies the page load events during the webpage's life cycle. For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser monitoring includes web app and queue time in Network time as part of the page load timing process. This is because Browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the Browser agent through auto-injection. You can view detailed information about how this \"back end\" time breaks down from the browser's point of view. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser spends time on DNS lookups and other network events. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces > (select a trace): Use Browser's session trace details to examine events and identify problems during the end user's webpage session. To navigate through a session trace, explore the waterfall chart by scrolling vertically through the event stack, or select individual events to view their details. If you want to... Do this... View the web page for this session trace Select the trace link. Jump to a specific time Select the time indicator or event on the heat map. View details about individual events Select any event in the waterfall chart. From there, select View full details if applicable. Change the location on the session trace Click on the heat map, or scroll vertically through the waterfall chart. Zoom in or out of the overall trace Select the plus or minus icons below the heat map. Share the session trace information Create a permalink to paste into a form, ticket, email, etc. Session segment definitions Important session trace measurements are displayed in the upper right corner of the Session traces page. The first four measurements represent how long into a session that the segment ended. For example, if Page Load is 0.202s, that means that the page load event completed 0.202 seconds after the request began. Session segment Description Backend The time from when the request began to when backend activity finished and DOM loading began. DOM processing The time from when the request began to when DOM processing finished. Page load The time from when the request began to when the page load event fired. Waiting on AJAX The time from when the request began to when AJAX activity ended. First interaction The time from when the request began to when the first user activity, like a mouse click or a scroll, was recorded. Duration The total duration of the session. Slow JavaScript execution and repainting Session traces help you identify callbacks in your JavaScript code that execute slowly and block the execution of subsequent calls on the browser's main thread. These calls should execute quickly in order to allow the browser to quickly repaint the page in response to user actions. Session traces highlight any callbacks longer than 33ms. If called in rapid succession (such as inside a requestAnimationFrame loop), callbacks longer than 33ms reduce the frame rate below 30 frames per second. This speed seems sluggish to users.",

View error profiles To view Browser monitoring error profiles: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > JS errors. To see error profile details: At the bottom of the JS errors UI page, select an error profile to expand it. What are error profiles? In Browser monitoring, an error profile is a potentially meaningful correlation New Relic has found between your JavaScript error attribute values when compared to normal PageView events. These correlations help you investigate the causes and contributing factors behind your errors. The screenshot below shows an example of an error profile. This error profile shows that the distribution of the userAgentOS attribute values varies significantly when JS error events are compared to normal (non-error) page view events. To investigate further, you could use the filter to display only Windows errors and see if there are other correlations. You can also filter the data used to generate error profiles to help you narrow down potential causes. For an analysis of a specific error profile, see the example error profile explanation. Filter error profile data To further filter the data used to generate error profiles and their comparison page views, use these JS errors page features: Time picker: select a time range used to generate the data. Filter: use the filter to display only error profiles and page views that have the attribute values you choose. You can select multiple attribute values. Example error profile explanation To help you better understand your own error profile data, this is an explanation of an example error profile's data. This error profile example has had a filter of userAgentName = Chrome applied, so it is only showing error data from Chrome browsers. This example profile has had a filter applied so that it is only showing error data from Chrome browsers. Column explanations: The first column is the attribute column. It shows the attribute values with the most deviation when compared to non-error page views. Less significant attribute values are aggregated in the Other category. In this example, the Chrome versions 36, 64, and 65 make up 100% of the errors for Chrome users. The JS errors column shows what percentage of JavaScriptError events have the attribute values from the first column. This column adds up to 100%, representing all errors from the chosen time range and filter set. In this example, a large percentage of Chrome errors are coming from Chrome version 36. If we wanted to investigate this further, we could filter to only show version 36 data. The Page views column shows what percentage of PageView events have the attribute values from the first column. In this example, less than 1% of Chrome users use Chrome version 36, but 55% of errors are generated by users with that version. The Difference column shows you the difference in percentage between the JS errors column and the Page views column. In this example, the 54% indicates that attribute is 54 percentage points higher for error events than for page views.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring supports the uploading of source maps, which are used to un-minify error stack traces on the JS errors page. This document explains how to use the API to publish (upload) source maps to Browser. Prepare for using the source map API In order to upload source maps to Browser via the API, you'll need this information: A user API key (before November 20, 2020, the Admin API key was required; that will still work if already in place) The New Relic application ID for the deployed app The full JavaScript file URL Optionally, if the JavaScript URL doesn't automatically have release info appended to it, the release name and ID What is the JavaScript URL? Every time the agent captures an error in your code, it's associated with the URL of the JavaScript in which it occurred. This is the src attribute of the script tag in your HTML. This full JavaScript URL is required when sending source maps to Browser. You can find the URL for an error's JavaScript file in Browser, on the JS errors page. See Browser monitoring source maps for more on finding these errors in the UI. Is a release name and ID required? Many organizations include a version number or hash in the JavaScript URL. This is generally added to \"bust\" caches to ensure your users get the most recent version of your code. This type of URL might look something like: https://example.com/assets/application-59.min.js https://example.com/assets/bundle-d6d031.min.js https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.js If your app's URLs automatically have the version info appended to it, the Browser agent has everything it needs in order to match errors with your code. You can move ahead to generating source maps. If this doesn't apply to you, and JS URLs do not have version info appended, you’ll have to assist the agent by specifying a release name and ID with the API. Are there limits to source map uploads? There is no limit to the overall number of source maps you can upload. However, the API is rate-limited: You can upload a maximum of 100 source maps per minute You can upload a maximum of 5,000 source maps per day Source map files can be a maximum of 50Mb in size. Push source maps to New Relic Now that you have one or more source maps, you are ready to publish it to Browser. You can use any of these methods to send source maps to Browser: Use the New Relic npm module with the API via the command line or via a client-side JavaScript build/deploy script like Gulp or Grunt. Use API curl commands. Use the Browser UI. Use npm module via command line or client-side script The easiest and recommended way to upload source maps to Browser is to use the our new @newrelic/publish-sourcemap npm module. It provides a command line tool and Javascript API to accomplish this task. More documentation is available in the npm repo. Here are some examples of using the npm module via the command line. Important The following examples are for US accounts. For EU accounts, the endpoint is https://sourcemaps.service.eu.newrelic.com. For more information, see Introduction to the EU region data center. npm command line: Publish Here's an example of uploading source maps using the npm module via the command line.

You can filter and drill down into detailed information, or use your mouse to select or zoom in and out of any location on the map. The enhanced attributes provide deep visibility not only about your end users' experience with page load timing, but also with network performance anywhere around the world. This level of visual detail is especially useful for professionals in IT and Operations to make business decisions about peering agreements and CDN usage. Contents Requirements Your New Relic Browser subscription level and your time picker settings determine what data you can view: Pro or higher: As of January 2016, the Filterable Geography feature automatically appears in your New Relic Browser user interface. No special setup is required. You can view up to eight days of data. Your application must be enabled to send PageView data to New Relic Insights in order to use Filterable Geography. Lite: The Filterable Geography feature appears in your New Relic Browser's UI menu but currently is not available for use. Any subscription level: If you need to use New Relic Browser's legacy Geography feature, you can still view it from your selected browser app. Factors affecting collected data To capture page load timing information, New Relic Browser uses the Navigation Timing API, which most (but not all) browsers support. If the browsers do not support the Navigation Timing API, then New Relic Browser charts and data points can only show the network data they receive for DNS lookup, connection, secure handshake, etc. This may not be 100% of the app's overall traffic. Also, firewalls may have an impact on the geographical data collected about your end users. View performance data by location one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map before drilling down into detailed information about London, England. To view or sort the performance information by location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Select the type of performance data to view from the dropdown, or use the default Average page load time. To drill down to a specific area, mouse over or select any area on the geographical map, or select any of the ten worst performing locations from the list to the right of the map. To view specific performance metrics, select any of the attributes below the funnel icon. To view comparison data, select the Page load performance or Historical performance chart below the selected location's geographical map. Use map functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions and page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the Filterable Geography page. If you want to... Do this... Change what kind of performance data appears Select your choice from the dropdown. Default performance indicator is Average page load time. The map's legend lists the ten best or worst performing areas (depending on the selected performance indicator) for the selected time period. For example: If you select Count, the map's legend shows the top ten locations with the highest number of page loads, as well as the average page load time for each. If you select Connection setup, New Relic Browser first filters out areas with low throughput. Then the map's legend shows the top ten locations where average connection time is the slowest, as well as the average page load time and count for each. View summary performance information about a specific location Mouse over any colored area on the map, select a location from the list, or zoom in and out of any area on the map. View detailed data for a location Select any area of the map. For example: If you select Canada, the map and legend show color-coded performance data for each province and territory. The list to the right of the map shows the top ten worst performing areas. If you select a specific province or territory, the map shows color-coded performance data for the top ten cities. The map includes circled locations which you can mouse over or select to view detailed information. In addition, the Page load performance and Historical performance charts below the map automatically update with each location you select. Hide the list of available attributes Select the funnel icon. Return to a larger world view Select another location on the map, or clear the filter labels above the map. Tip To return to the original map view of the world, select any area on an ocean. Examine heat map details one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map as you use filter and zoom tools to drill down into detailed information about London, England. Athough overall throughput for the area is good (green), the nearby yellow areas, and the smaller red and orange circles indicate nearby cities with varying levels of throughput problems, not the size of those cities. The Filterable Geography heat map identifies performance quality with color and with the size of circles. Heat map Description Color scale Performance quality ranges from green (the best) to yellow, orange, and then red (the worst). When selecting indicators of usage rather than performance, the heat map shows shades of purple, with the darkest shades indicating the highest usage. The color scale adapts to your app's specific performance. Each area is a percentile range. To view the range for each color segment, mouse over the heat map's legend. Thresholds Different thresholds are dynamically applied to the colors based on the type of performance indicator you select from the dropdown and the maximum value your app has reported. For example, green for Average page load time may indicate 0 to 3.3 seconds, while green for Average network time may indicate 0 to 256 milliseconds. Circles The map's colored circles help you identify areas with performance problems at a glance. Each circle's radius is based on throughput reported for the city it represents, not the size of the city itself. You may see many circles overlapping each other. This usually indicates a grouping of metropolitan areas which represent a geographic area of heavy traffic. Filter performance metrics The Filter feature allows you to select and group data by attributes in various categories, including: Page view Geography Browser Identity Custom The filtered results appear on the geographical map, where you can use any of the standard map functions to explore additional details. Here are some examples. Unsatisfactory network performance by ASN In this example, your organization is preparing to renew a peering agreement with the owner of an autonomous system, called \"My-ASN.\" You are concerned that continued outages and other connection issues are affecting customer satisfaction with your site, and you want to compare its performance with other ASNs. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. From the performance type dropdown, select Connection setup. Select the funnel icon. To view the specific ASN's performance: From the search window, type My-ASN, and then select this name from the Filter by results. OR To compare performance with other ASNs: From Geography attributes > ASN organizations, review the performance data for each organization on the list, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filter, select the attribute name. Page rendering performance during sales promotion In this example, your organization has a special three-day sales promotion for an upcoming holiday. Your holiday-merchandise page has undergone major changes, including dozens of new images. You want to look for performance problems with page rendering on Android mobile devices during this sales period. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Use the time picker to change the date range to the promotion period. From the performance type dropdown, select Page rendering. Select the funnel icon. From Page view attributes > Page Url, select your site's holiday-merchandise page, and then select Back to groupings list. From Browser attributes > User agent OS, select Android, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filters, select their attribute names. View comparative performance details Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with comparative performance details for the selected location. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with details for the selected location. The Page load performance tab shows two charts. The Average page load time chart includes: Average page load time for each segment of the page load timing process in seconds Request queuing information (the time after a request enters your production systems and before it reaches your application) if applicable The Average network time chart shows key elements, including how long it takes for DNS lookup, connection establishment, and secure handshake, in seconds. Tip Sometimes areas on the charts may appear to be zero or near zero. This is because some apps use existing TCP connections, and they do not need to establish new connections. The Historical performance tab shows comparison data for the selected time period, yesterday, and last week for the selected location. This includes: Average response time Throughput in pages per minute (ppm) Available metrics You can filter and group geographical performance data in New Relic Browser and in New Relic Insights. Available metrics include: Performance Metrics Webpage Page load time Throughput (pages per minute or ppm) Network time Connection time Secure connection time Network Autonomous system number and name (ASN) via IP mapping SSL negotiation timing DNS timing Time to first byte ASN latitude and longitude for Internet service providers (ISPs) To ensure end user security, New Relic Browser collects GeoIP information for the end user's ISP. New Relic Browser does not collect GeoIP information for the specific end user. For example, if an end user in Portland, Oregon uses an ISP located in Beaverton, Oregon, New Relic Browser collects the GeoIP information for the ISP in Beaverton. User agents Operating systems Browser names or types Browser versions Device types Performance and usage ranges The color-coded legend shows performance and usage as percentile ranges. Performance color ranges Percentile colors for performance range from green (the best) to red (the worst). Performance percentile ranges (best to worst) Green Yellow Orange Red Back-end duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Connection setup duration 0-96.9 97-97.9 98-98.9 99+ DNS lookup duration 0-96.9 97-97.9 98-98.9 99+ DOM processing duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Network duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Page load duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Page rendering duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Queue duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Secure handshake duration 0-96.9 97-97.9 98-98.9 99+ Web app duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Usage color ranges Percentile colors for usage counts appear as shades of purple, from lightest (lowest usage) to darkest (highest usage).

Page load timing, individual asset loads, user interactions, AJAX requests, callbacks, errors, and other events appear in an interactive timeline which includes a detailed waterfall visualization, a heat map overview, and highlighted metrics and problems related to that session. Identify problems and solutions Session traces help you understand: How users experience your page load, including time to DOM load, time waiting for AJAX requests to complete, and the user's interactions with the page How the New Relic metrics reflect your end users' experiences What is the sequence of JavaScript and browser events, which take longer than others, and when each event occurs Where bottlenecks occur, and what may be causing them Why one page load may be slower than others, by providing the context for individual events during a session By connecting performance to user experience and interactions to performance, this detailed and intuitive visualization of all events in the user's session can help pinpoint problem areas and easily identify solutions. Requirements To use Browser monitoring's session traces feature, make sure you meet these requirements: Your agent version must support Browser monitoring. If you're using multiple names for an app, session traces will only report to the most specific application. For accounts older than October 2014, you must enable Browser monitoring and the enhanced Pro features. Browser randomly captures traces only from browsers that support the Resource Timing API. Select a session trace The Session traces index lists the most recent traces based on the time picker selection for the selected app. Session traces are randomly sampled and stored at a rate of 90/hour. You can page through up to 500 traces at a time. Additionally, you can sort and search the list by attributes, including: Full URL, with query string parameters removed Browser type Started at date/time Page load time one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces: You can select a session trace from the Browser index. You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors, and AJAX pages. To select a specific session trace: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > Session traces. To locate a session trace from a different date or time period, use the time picker. To limit the index to a specific type of trace, use the search window. To view detailed information, select the session trace's link. Tip You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors and AJAX pages. View session trace details The Session trace details page provides summary information about the trace, a heat map with timing details, and a waterfall of events that you can explore. The color-coded legend identifies the page load events during the webpage's life cycle. For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser monitoring includes web app and queue time in Network time as part of the page load timing process. This is because Browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the Browser agent through auto-injection. You can view detailed information about how this \"back end\" time breaks down from the browser's point of view. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser spends time on DNS lookups and other network events. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces > (select a trace): Use Browser's session trace details to examine events and identify problems during the end user's webpage session. To navigate through a session trace, explore the waterfall chart by scrolling vertically through the event stack, or select individual events to view their details. If you want to... Do this... View the web page for this session trace Select the trace link. Jump to a specific time Select the time indicator or event on the heat map. View details about individual events Select any event in the waterfall chart. From there, select View full details if applicable. Change the location on the session trace Click on the heat map, or scroll vertically through the waterfall chart. Zoom in or out of the overall trace Select the plus or minus icons below the heat map. Share the session trace information Create a permalink to paste into a form, ticket, email, etc. Session segment definitions Important session trace measurements are displayed in the upper right corner of the Session traces page. The first four measurements represent how long into a session that the segment ended. For example, if Page Load is 0.202s, that means that the page load event completed 0.202 seconds after the request began. Session segment Description Backend The time from when the request began to when backend activity finished and DOM loading began. DOM processing The time from when the request began to when DOM processing finished. Page load The time from when the request began to when the page load event fired. Waiting on AJAX The time from when the request began to when AJAX activity ended. First interaction The time from when the request began to when the first user activity, like a mouse click or a scroll, was recorded. Duration The total duration of the session. Slow JavaScript execution and repainting Session traces help you identify callbacks in your JavaScript code that execute slowly and block the execution of subsequent calls on the browser's main thread. These calls should execute quickly in order to allow the browser to quickly repaint the page in response to user actions. Session traces highlight any callbacks longer than 33ms. If called in rapid succession (such as inside a requestAnimationFrame loop), callbacks longer than 33ms reduce the frame rate below 30 frames per second. This speed seems sluggish to users.",

View error profiles To view Browser monitoring error profiles: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > JS errors. To see error profile details: At the bottom of the JS errors UI page, select an error profile to expand it. What are error profiles? In Browser monitoring, an error profile is a potentially meaningful correlation New Relic has found between your JavaScript error attribute values when compared to normal PageView events. These correlations help you investigate the causes and contributing factors behind your errors. The screenshot below shows an example of an error profile. This error profile shows that the distribution of the userAgentOS attribute values varies significantly when JS error events are compared to normal (non-error) page view events. To investigate further, you could use the filter to display only Windows errors and see if there are other correlations. You can also filter the data used to generate error profiles to help you narrow down potential causes. For an analysis of a specific error profile, see the example error profile explanation. Filter error profile data To further filter the data used to generate error profiles and their comparison page views, use these JS errors page features: Time picker: select a time range used to generate the data. Filter: use the filter to display only error profiles and page views that have the attribute values you choose. You can select multiple attribute values. Example error profile explanation To help you better understand your own error profile data, this is an explanation of an example error profile's data. This error profile example has had a filter of userAgentName = Chrome applied, so it is only showing error data from Chrome browsers. This example profile has had a filter applied so that it is only showing error data from Chrome browsers. Column explanations: The first column is the attribute column. It shows the attribute values with the most deviation when compared to non-error page views. Less significant attribute values are aggregated in the Other category. In this example, the Chrome versions 36, 64, and 65 make up 100% of the errors for Chrome users. The JS errors column shows what percentage of JavaScriptError events have the attribute values from the first column. This column adds up to 100%, representing all errors from the chosen time range and filter set. In this example, a large percentage of Chrome errors are coming from Chrome version 36. If we wanted to investigate this further, we could filter to only show version 36 data. The Page views column shows what percentage of PageView events have the attribute values from the first column. In this example, less than 1% of Chrome users use Chrome version 36, but 55% of errors are generated by users with that version. The Difference column shows you the difference in percentage between the JS errors column and the Page views column. In this example, the 54% indicates that attribute is 54 percentage points higher for error events than for page views.",

You can filter and drill down into detailed information, or use your mouse to select or zoom in and out of any location on the map. The enhanced attributes provide deep visibility not only about your end users' experience with page load timing, but also with network performance anywhere around the world. This level of visual detail is especially useful for professionals in IT and Operations to make business decisions about peering agreements and CDN usage. Contents Requirements Your New Relic Browser subscription level and your time picker settings determine what data you can view: Pro or higher: As of January 2016, the Filterable Geography feature automatically appears in your New Relic Browser user interface. No special setup is required. You can view up to eight days of data. Your application must be enabled to send PageView data to New Relic Insights in order to use Filterable Geography. Lite: The Filterable Geography feature appears in your New Relic Browser's UI menu but currently is not available for use. Any subscription level: If you need to use New Relic Browser's legacy Geography feature, you can still view it from your selected browser app. Factors affecting collected data To capture page load timing information, New Relic Browser uses the Navigation Timing API, which most (but not all) browsers support. If the browsers do not support the Navigation Timing API, then New Relic Browser charts and data points can only show the network data they receive for DNS lookup, connection, secure handshake, etc. This may not be 100% of the app's overall traffic.

Here is a summary of additional options with the Filterable Geography page. If you want to... Do this... Change what kind of performance data appears Select your choice from the dropdown. Default performance indicator is Average page load time. The map's legend lists the ten best or worst performing areas (depending on the selected performance indicator) for the selected time period. For example: If you select Count, the map's legend shows the top ten locations with the highest number of page loads, as well as the average page load time for each. If you select Connection setup, New Relic Browser first filters out areas with low throughput. Then the map's legend shows the top ten locations where average connection time is the slowest, as well as the average page load time and count for each. View summary performance information about a specific location Mouse over any colored area on the map, select a location from the list, or zoom in and out of any area on the map. View detailed data for a location Select any area of the map. For example: If you select Canada, the map and legend show color-coded performance data for each province and territory. The list to the right of the map shows the top ten worst performing areas. If you select a specific province or territory, the map shows color-coded performance data for the top ten cities.

Heat map Description Color scale Performance quality ranges from green (the best) to yellow, orange, and then red (the worst). When selecting indicators of usage rather than performance, the heat map shows shades of purple, with the darkest shades indicating the highest usage. The color scale adapts to your app's specific performance. Each area is a percentile range. To view the range for each color segment, mouse over the heat map's legend. Thresholds Different thresholds are dynamically applied to the colors based on the type of performance indicator you select from the dropdown and the maximum value your app has reported. For example, green for Average page load time may indicate 0 to 3.3 seconds, while green for Average network time may indicate 0 to 256 milliseconds. Circles The map's colored circles help you identify areas with performance problems at a glance. Each circle's radius is based on throughput reported for the city it represents, not the size of the city itself. You may see many circles overlapping each other. This usually indicates a grouping of metropolitan areas which represent a geographic area of heavy traffic. Filter performance metrics The Filter feature allows you to select and group data by attributes in various categories, including: Page view Geography Browser Identity Custom The filtered results appear on the geographical map, where you can use any of the standard map functions to explore additional details. Here are some examples. Unsatisfactory network performance by ASN In this example, your organization is preparing to renew a peering agreement with the owner of an autonomous system, called \"My-ASN.\" You are concerned that continued outages and other connection issues are affecting customer satisfaction with your site, and you want to compare its performance with other ASNs. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. From the performance type dropdown, select Connection setup. Select the funnel icon. To view the specific ASN's performance: From the search window, type My-ASN, and then select this name from the Filter by results. OR To compare performance with other ASNs: From Geography attributes > ASN organizations, review the performance data for each organization on the list, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filter, select the attribute name. Page rendering performance during sales promotion In this example, your organization has a special three-day sales promotion for an upcoming holiday. Your holiday-merchandise page has undergone major changes, including dozens of new images. You want to look for performance problems with page rendering on Android mobile devices during this sales period. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Use the time picker to change the date range to the promotion period. From the performance type dropdown, select Page rendering. Select the funnel icon. From Page view attributes > Page Url, select your site's holiday-merchandise page, and then select Back to groupings list. From Browser attributes > User agent OS, select Android, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filters, select their attribute names. View comparative performance details Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with comparative performance details for the selected location. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with details for the selected location. The Page load performance tab shows two charts. The Average page load time chart includes: Average page load time for each segment of the page load timing process in seconds Request queuing information (the time after a request enters your production systems and before it reaches your application) if applicable The Average network time chart shows key elements, including how long it takes for DNS lookup, connection establishment, and secure handshake, in seconds. Tip Sometimes areas on the charts may appear to be zero or near zero. This is because some apps use existing TCP connections, and they do not need to establish new connections. The Historical performance tab shows comparison data for the selected time period, yesterday, and last week for the selected location. This includes: Average response time Throughput in pages per minute (ppm) Available metrics You can filter and group geographical performance data in New Relic Browser and in New Relic Insights. Available metrics include: Performance Metrics Webpage Page load time Throughput (pages per minute or ppm) Network time Connection time Secure connection time Network Autonomous system number and name (ASN) via IP mapping SSL negotiation timing DNS timing Time to first byte ASN latitude and longitude for Internet service providers (ISPs) To ensure end user security, New Relic Browser collects GeoIP information for the end user's ISP. New Relic Browser does not collect GeoIP information for the specific end user. For example, if an end user in Portland, Oregon uses an ISP located in Beaverton, Oregon, New Relic Browser collects the GeoIP information for the ISP in Beaverton. User agents Operating systems Browser names or types Browser versions Device types Performance and usage ranges The color-coded legend shows performance and usage as percentile ranges. Performance color ranges Percentile colors for performance range from green (the best) to red (the worst). Performance percentile ranges (best to worst) Green Yellow Orange Red Back-end duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Connection setup duration 0-96.9 97-97.9 98-98.9 99+ DNS lookup duration 0-96.9 97-97.9 98-98.9 99+ DOM processing duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Network duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Page load duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Page rendering duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Queue duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Secure handshake duration 0-96.9 97-97.9 98-98.9 99+ Web app duration 0-74.9 75-86.9 87-94.9 95+ Usage color ranges Percentile colors for usage counts appear as shades of purple, from lightest (lowest usage) to darkest (highest usage).

Page load timing, individual asset loads, user interactions, AJAX requests, callbacks, errors, and other events appear in an interactive timeline which includes a detailed waterfall visualization, a heat map overview, and highlighted metrics and problems related to that session. Identify problems and solutions Session traces help you understand: How users experience your page load, including time to DOM load, time waiting for AJAX requests to complete, and the user's interactions with the page How the New Relic metrics reflect your end users' experiences What is the sequence of JavaScript and browser events, which take longer than others, and when each event occurs Where bottlenecks occur, and what may be causing them Why one page load may be slower than others, by providing the context for individual events during a session By connecting performance to user experience and interactions to performance, this detailed and intuitive visualization of all events in the user's session can help pinpoint problem areas and easily identify solutions. Requirements To use Browser monitoring's session traces feature, make sure you meet these requirements: Your agent version must support Browser monitoring. If you're using multiple names for an app, session traces will only report to the most specific application. For accounts older than October 2014, you must enable Browser monitoring and the enhanced Pro features. Browser randomly captures traces only from browsers that support the Resource Timing API. Select a session trace The Session traces index lists the most recent traces based on the time picker selection for the selected app. Session traces are randomly sampled and stored at a rate of 90/hour. You can page through up to 500 traces at a time. Additionally, you can sort and search the list by attributes, including: Full URL, with query string parameters removed Browser type Started at date/time Page load time one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces: You can select a session trace from the Browser index. You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors, and AJAX pages. To select a specific session trace: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > Session traces. To locate a session trace from a different date or time period, use the time picker. To limit the index to a specific type of trace, use the search window. To view detailed information, select the session trace's link. Tip You can also select a session trace directly from the Browser Summary, Page views, JS errors and AJAX pages. View session trace details The Session trace details page provides summary information about the trace, a heat map with timing details, and a waterfall of events that you can explore. The color-coded legend identifies the page load events during the webpage's life cycle. For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser monitoring includes web app and queue time in Network time as part of the page load timing process. This is because Browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the Browser agent through auto-injection. You can view detailed information about how this \"back end\" time breaks down from the browser's point of view. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser spends time on DNS lookups and other network events. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces > (select a trace): Use Browser's session trace details to examine events and identify problems during the end user's webpage session. To navigate through a session trace, explore the waterfall chart by scrolling vertically through the event stack, or select individual events to view their details. If you want to... Do this... View the web page for this session trace Select the trace link. Jump to a specific time Select the time indicator or event on the heat map. View details about individual events Select any event in the waterfall chart. From there, select View full details if applicable. Change the location on the session trace Click on the heat map, or scroll vertically through the waterfall chart. Zoom in or out of the overall trace Select the plus or minus icons below the heat map. Share the session trace information Create a permalink to paste into a form, ticket, email, etc. Session segment definitions Important session trace measurements are displayed in the upper right corner of the Session traces page. The first four measurements represent how long into a session that the segment ended. For example, if Page Load is 0.202s, that means that the page load event completed 0.202 seconds after the request began. Session segment Description Backend The time from when the request began to when backend activity finished and DOM loading began. DOM processing The time from when the request began to when DOM processing finished. Page load The time from when the request began to when the page load event fired. Waiting on AJAX The time from when the request began to when AJAX activity ended. First interaction The time from when the request began to when the first user activity, like a mouse click or a scroll, was recorded. Duration The total duration of the session. Slow JavaScript execution and repainting Session traces help you identify callbacks in your JavaScript code that execute slowly and block the execution of subsequent calls on the browser's main thread. These calls should execute quickly in order to allow the browser to quickly repaint the page in response to user actions. Session traces highlight any callbacks longer than 33ms. If called in rapid succession (such as inside a requestAnimationFrame loop), callbacks longer than 33ms reduce the frame rate below 30 frames per second. This speed seems sluggish to users.",

View error profiles To view Browser monitoring error profiles: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser > (select an app) > JS errors. To see error profile details: At the bottom of the JS errors UI page, select an error profile to expand it. What are error profiles? In Browser monitoring, an error profile is a potentially meaningful correlation New Relic has found between your JavaScript error attribute values when compared to normal PageView events. These correlations help you investigate the causes and contributing factors behind your errors. The screenshot below shows an example of an error profile. This error profile shows that the distribution of the userAgentOS attribute values varies significantly when JS error events are compared to normal (non-error) page view events. To investigate further, you could use the filter to display only Windows errors and see if there are other correlations. You can also filter the data used to generate error profiles to help you narrow down potential causes. For an analysis of a specific error profile, see the example error profile explanation. Filter error profile data To further filter the data used to generate error profiles and their comparison page views, use these JS errors page features: Time picker: select a time range used to generate the data. Filter: use the filter to display only error profiles and page views that have the attribute values you choose. You can select multiple attribute values. Example error profile explanation To help you better understand your own error profile data, this is an explanation of an example error profile's data. This error profile example has had a filter of userAgentName = Chrome applied, so it is only showing error data from Chrome browsers. This example profile has had a filter applied so that it is only showing error data from Chrome browsers. Column explanations: The first column is the attribute column. It shows the attribute values with the most deviation when compared to non-error page views. Less significant attribute values are aggregated in the Other category. In this example, the Chrome versions 36, 64, and 65 make up 100% of the errors for Chrome users. The JS errors column shows what percentage of JavaScriptError events have the attribute values from the first column. This column adds up to 100%, representing all errors from the chosen time range and filter set. In this example, a large percentage of Chrome errors are coming from Chrome version 36. If we wanted to investigate this further, we could filter to only show version 36 data. The Page views column shows what percentage of PageView events have the attribute values from the first column. In this example, less than 1% of Chrome users use Chrome version 36, but 55% of errors are generated by users with that version. The Difference column shows you the difference in percentage between the JS errors column and the Page views column. In this example, the 54% indicates that attribute is 54 percentage points higher for error events than for page views.",

      "body": "Our Python agent lets you change the default agent behavior agent using configuration options. The only required Python agent configuration setting is the license key. The license key identifies the account where the agent reports application data. Depending on how you are hosting your application, the license key can be provided via a configuration file or an environment variable. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Python agent is via the configuration file, which is generated as part of the standard install process. It is also possible to set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI or by using environment variables. You can also specify some settings on a per-request basis by passing settings with the WSGI request environ dictionary. The Python agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: With the Python agent, per-request options override server-side config. If enabled, server-side config overrides all corresponding values in the agent config file, even if the server-side values are left blank. The agent config file overrides environment variables. Environment variables override the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file Typically you configure your Python agent from a local configuration file on the agent's host system. Supply the path to the config file at startup using one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the path to the config file as the first argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you use the newrelic-admin wrapper script, you must use the environment variable because the wrapper script calls the agent automatically. The configuration file uses a structure similar to Microsoft Windows .ini files. For more information, see the Python ConfigParser module's file format documentation. Tip A sample configuration file is included with the Python agent as newrelic/newrelic.ini. You can also generate one from the newrelic-admin script using the generate-config command, or download a copy from our download repo. Server-side configuration Tip Owner or Admins Server-side configuration allows you to configure certain settings in the New Relic One UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. Important If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the config file that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty string and does not use the agent config file. Environment variables Environment variables allow you to override the defaults for certain core settings. If the equivalent setting is explicitly listed in the agent config file, the config file settings take precedence over the environment variable. Where available, environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. For simple configurations, you can use the environment variables in conjunction with server-side configuration and avoid the agent config file altogether. This is the default setup with Heroku, where installing the New Relic add-on automatically populates the necessary environment variables. Environment variable Configuration setting NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY license_key NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME app_name NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE monitor_mode NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE developer_mode NEW_RELIC_LOG log_file NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL log_level NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY high_security NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME proxy_scheme NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST proxy_host NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT proxy_port NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER proxy_user NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS proxy_pass NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG audit_log_file NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT startup_timeout NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT shutdown_timeout NEW_RELIC_LABELS labels NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME process_host.display_name NEW_RELIC_API_KEY api_key NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH ca_bundle_path NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED distributed_tracing.enabled NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG feature_flag Per-request configuration For certain WSGI servers, you can override the app name and capture attributes settings on a per-request basis. This is possible with WSGI servers where you can define additional key/value pairs that are passed into the per-request WSGI environ dictionary. Set these values with the strings on, off, true, false, 1 and 0. If set from a configuration mechanism implemented using Python code, Python objects evaluating to True or False will also be accepted. Example: Apache/mod_wsgi app name In the Apache/mod_wsgi server, you can use the SetEnv directive to override config settings (optionally inside a Location or Directory block). For example, you could override the app name for a complete virtual host, or for a subset of URLs handled by the WSGI application for that virtual host. In addition to being able to override certain agent configuration settings, you can set other per-request configuration settings with their WSGI environment key: newrelic.set_background_task If set to true, this web transaction will instead be reported as a non-web transaction. newrelic.ignore_transaction If set to true, this web transaction will not be reported. newrelic.suppress_apdex_metric If set to true, no Apdex metric will be generated for this web transaction. newrelic.suppress_transaction_trace If set to true, this web transaction cannot be recorded in a transaction trace. newrelic.disable_browser_autorum If set to true, this disables automatic insertion of the JavaScript header/footer for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). Only applicable if auto-insertion is available for your web framework. Important Using a WSGI middleware to set these values will not work where the Python agent's own WSGI application wrapper was applied at an outer scope. In these cases you must make calls to the agent API to achieve the same outcome. Multiple environment configuration The agent reads its primary configuration from an agent config section called newrelic. You can provide overrides for specific deployment environments (for example, Development, Staging, Production) in additional sections. Preface these sections with [newrelic:environment], where environment is replaced with the name of your environment. To specify that the agent should use an environment-based configuration, use one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the environment name as the second argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT environment variable to the environment name. If no environment is specified, the agent will use the default settings as specified in the newrelic agent config section. The basic structure of the configuration file is: [newrelic] ... default settings [newrelic:development] ... override settings [newrelic:staging] ... override settings [newrelic:production] ... override settings Copy General configuration settings These settings are available in the agent configuration file. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Specifies the license key of your New Relic account. This key associates your app's metrics with your New Relic account. app_name (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Type String Default Python Application Set in Per-request option, config file, environment variable Per-request option newrelic.app_name Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic One UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon ;. Do not put a space before the semicolon, which causes the Python config parser to interpret the name as an embedded comment. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent collects performance data about your app and reports this data to our data collector. developer_mode Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE When true, the agent will instrument your web app, but will not send any actual data. In this offline mode, you will not be billed for an active agent. Use developer mode to test new versions of the agent, or test the agent against third-party packages in a developer environment. Offline mode is not a way of running the APM locally, because the metrics the agent collects are not reported anywhere. log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Sets the name of a log file, which is useful for debugging issues with the agent. This is not set by default, since the agent does not know your web app process's parent user or what directories that process has permission to write to. For detailed information, see Python agent logging. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct, and that the user that your web application runs as can write to the file. Tip Use an absolute path unless you are sure what the working directory of your application will be at startup. If you can't write out a log file, you can also use stderr and output to standard error output. This would normally result in output appearing in your web server log. log_level Type String Default info Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages, if you've set the log file location. This log_level will not affect the Python logging module log level. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are critical, error, warning, info, and debug. To report agent issues, the most useful setting is debug. However, debug generates a lot of information very quickly, so do not keep the agent at this level for longer than it takes to reproduce your problem. high_security Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data is sent to us. Enabling high security mode means that request parameters are not collected, and you cannot send raw SQL. To activate high security mode, set it to true in the local .ini configuration file and activate it in the Account Settings in the UI. For more information, see High security. proxy_scheme, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass Type Strings Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variables NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS By default, the Python agent attempts to directly connect to our servers. If there is a firewall between your host and the our collector that requires you to use an HTTP proxy, set proxy_host and proxy_port to the required values for your HTTP proxy. If proxy authentication is implemented by the HTTP proxy, also set proxy_user and proxy_pass. The proxy_scheme setting dictates what protocol scheme is used to talk to the HTTP proxy. When set to http, the agent uses a SSL tunnel through the HTTP proxy for end-to-end encryption. Instead of setting the proxy_scheme, proxy_host and proxy_port settings, you can also set the proxy_host setting to a valid URI for the proxy. Include the scheme, host, and port; for example, http://proxy-host:8000. This also works if you set the details of the HTTP proxy with the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST environment variable. Tip Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending whether ssl is disabled or enabled. If you are upgrading from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the ssl setting for backwards compatibility. As proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme, not setting proxy_scheme may result in a failure. audit_log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG Sets the name of the audit log file. If set, the agent logs details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the collector. This allows you to evaluate the security of the Python agent. Use an absolute path unless you are sure what your app's working directory will be at startup. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. Also ensure your web app's parent user can write to the file. Caution Do not use audit logging on an ongoing basis, especially in a production environment. Because the agent does not truncate or rotate the log file, the log file can grow very quickly. labels (tags) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS Adds tags. Specify name:value separated by a colon :, and separate additional tags with semicolons ;. Two tags Server:One;Data Center:Primary Copy process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. api_key Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_KEY Sets the api_key to be used with newrelic-admin record-deploy. ca_bundle_path Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 4.2.0 and newer. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T We'll record transaction traces when they exceed this threshold. The format is a number of seconds (decimal points allowed). See our glossary entry for apdex_t Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. In addition to configuring attributes for all four destinations with the general attribute settings below, they can also be configured on a per-destination basis. For more information, see Python agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes, and Attribute examples. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. Transaction tracer configuration Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. The agent automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? If enabled, the transaction tracer captures deep information about slow transactions. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Positive float or string (apdex_f) Default apdex_f Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds this threshold, the agent records a transaction trace. Valid values are any positive float, or apdex_f (four times apdex_t). transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default obfuscated Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Record SQL? When the transaction tracer is enabled, the agent can record SQL statements. The recorder has three modes: off (sends no SQL), raw (sends the SQL statement in its original form), and obfuscated (strips out numeric and string literals). Most web frameworks (including Django) parameterize SQL queries so they do not actually contain the values used to fill out the query. If you use raw mode with one of these frameworks, the Python agent will only see the SQL prior to insertion of values. The parametrized SQL will look much like obfuscated mode. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Stack trace threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack traces from SQL calls. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent captures the current stack trace. This is helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate in an application. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable SQL query plans? Determines whether the Python agent will capture query plans for slow SQL queries. Only supported in MySQL and PostgreSQL. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Query plan threshold Queries in transaction traces that exceed this threshold will report slow query data and any available explain plans. Explain plan collection will not happen if transaction_tracer.explain_enabled is false. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.function_trace Type String Default (none) Set in Config file For the specified functions or methods, the agent will capture additional function timing instrumentation. Specify these names in the form module:function or module:class.function. Transaction segment configuration Here are Transaction segment settings available via the agent configuration file. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for segments of transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to segments of transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_segments.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for segments of transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_segments.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Error collector configuration Here are error collector settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable error collection? If enabled, the error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions. error_collector.ignore_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these errors To stop collecting specific errors, set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to ignore. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip Before version 6.4.0 of the agent, this setting was named error_collector.ignore_errors. If your configuration file still uses ignore_errors, update your agent to use ignore_classes. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default 100-102 200-208 226 300-308 404 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these status codes Lists HTTP status codes which the agent should ignore rather than record as errors. List additional status codes as integers separated by spaces, and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To add one of the default codes to your allow list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option can only be set in server-side configuration in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these error class names Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to be expected. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these status codes Prevents specified HTTP status codes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. List status codes as integers separated by spaces and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To negate one of the codes in your list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python Agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless on how this configuration setting (error_collector.attributes.enabled) is set. error_collector.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file If enabled, the error collector captures event data for advanced analytics. For more information, see APM Errors. Browser monitoring settings Here are browser monitoring settings available via the agent configuration file. browser_monitoring.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables browser monitoring. For more information, see Page load timing in Python. Important Before enabling browser monitoring in the config file, enable it in the application settings in the browser monitoring UI. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file For supported Python web frameworks, this setting enables auto-insertion of the browser monitoring JavaScript fragments. browser_monitoring.content_type Type String Default text/html Set in Config file Specify the HTML Content-Type(s) that our browser monitoring agent should auto-instrument. Add additional entries in a space-separated list. Instrument xhtml+xml page responses If you are generating HTML page responses and using the Content-Type of application/xhtml+xml, you can override the allowed content types to list both this content type and the default text/html by using: browser_monitoring.content_type = text/html application/xhtml+xml Copy Important The browser monitoring JavaScript snippet prevents the page from validating as application/xhtml+xml, although the page should load and render in end-user browsers. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data which gets sent to page view events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how the configuration setting (browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled) is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Transaction events settings Here are Transaction events settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip These configuration settings used to be called analytic_events. If your configuration file still uses analytic_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. transaction_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Transaction event data allows the use of additional information such as histograms and percentiles. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_events.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_events.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in transaction events. Note that excluding attributes from transaction events does not exclude from span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events settings Here are custom events settings available via the agent configuration file. custom_insights_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Allow recording of events to the Insights custom events API via record_custom_event(). Datastore tracer settings These datastore tracer settings are available via the agent configuration file: datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are also reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects database name for some database drivers. The database name is reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. Distributed tracing settings Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Python agent version 4.2.0.100 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Settings include: distributed_tracing.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. Span event configuration Span events are collected for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Configuration options include: span_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off whether the Python agent sends spans. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off for all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this configuration setting (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Event harvest configuration Event harvest settings limit the amount of event type data sent to New Relic. When you use these settings, consider these important points: Event harvest settings affect the limits for a single instance of the agent, and not across the entire application. See the usage example below for how to set limits across an entire application. Real time streaming sends data every five seconds (12 times per minute), but the event harvest settings still affect the rate in events per minute. Enabling or disabling real time streaming does not require changing these settings. With real time streaming (enabled by default), New Relic will display the event harvest limits for entities in five second intervals. This means, for example, when you set a limit value of 1200 in the config file, you'll see it as 100 in New Relic. Usage example Let's say an application is deployed across 10 hosts, each running four processes per host. To limit the number of span events to 10,000 events per minute for the entire application, divide that number by 10 hosts. Then divide again by four processes per host. 10000 / (10 * 4) = 250 Based on that calculation, the final setting is: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data = 250 Event harvest configuration settings include: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.analytic_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for analytic events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.custom_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for custom events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Custom events are created through the Python Telemetry SDK. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data Type Integer Default 1000 Set in Config file Limit for span events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.error_event_data Type Integer Default 100 Set in Config file Limit for error events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Event loop visibility settings Important Requires Python agent version 5.0.0.124 or higher. Event loop visibility surfaces information about transactions that block the event loop. The agent will generate information about transactions that have waited a significant amount of time to acquire control of the event loop. Settings include: event_loop_visibility.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Set this to false to disable event loop information. event_loop_visibility.blocking_threshold Type Float Default 0.1 Set in Config file Threshold in seconds for how long a transaction must block the event loop before generating event loop information. Garbage collection runtime metrics settings Important Requires Python agent version 6.2.0.156 or higher. These garbage collection runtime metrics settings are available via the agent configuration file: gc_runtime_metrics.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file When enabled, the agent will generate and send garbage collection metrics. gc_runtime_metrics.top_object_count_limit Type Integer Default 5 Set in Config file The agent reports object count metrics for the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector. For each object type, this setting allows you to set the maximum number of individual metrics that will be sampled. Other configuration settings Here are assorted other settings available via the agent configuration file. utilization.detect_aws Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an AWS environment. utilization.detect_azure Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an Azure environment. utilization.detect_gcp Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Google Cloud Platform environment. utilization.detect_pcf Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment. utilization.detect_docker Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in Docker. slow_sql.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable Slow SQL? If enabled, the agent captures details from long-running SQL database queries. thread_profiler.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable thread profiler? Enables you to schedule thread profiling sessions. The thread profiler will periodically capture a snapshot of the call stack for each active thread in the application to construct a statistically representative call tree. cross_application_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables cross application tracing, which connect your apps and services within your service-oriented architecture. strip_exception_messages.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file If enabled, exception messages will be stripped from error traces before they are sent to the collector, in order to prevent the inadvertent capture of sensitive information. This option is automatically enabled in high security mode. strip_exception_messages.whitelist Type String Default (none) Set in Config file Exceptions listed in your allow list will not have their messages stripped, even if strip_exception_messages.enabled is true. The allow list is a space-separated string of exception types, each in the form of module:exception_name. List built-in exceptions as exception_name; you do not need to prepend module: to them. Example: Built-in exception and user-defined exception KeyError my_module:MyException Copy startup_timeout Type Float Default 0.0 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT By default, the agent starts when it receives the first transaction (either web or non-web). The agent then starts in parallel, ensuring that this initial request is not delayed. However, the agent does not record the details of this initial request because the agent cannot collect data until registration is complete. To override this, you can set a startup timeout in seconds. The agent will then pause the initial transaction and wait for registration to complete. Important Since startup_timeout delays your app start, we recommend only setting a startup timeout for background task queuing systems, not web applications. shutdown_timeout Type Float Default 2.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT On process shutdown, the agent attempts one final upload to the collector. To prevent the agent running indefinitely in case of an issue, the process shuts down normally if the shutdown_timeout threshold is reached. This shutdown can result in data loss, but the agent prioritizes key metric data during the upload process. For background task queuing systems, especially those which run a small number of tasks per process, you may want to increase the shutdown timeout to ensure the agent can upload all data on process shutdown. Tip The agent defaults to a 2.5 second timeout because Apache and many other web servers have a 3.0 second process termination timeout. The agent exits at 2.5 seconds to allow atexit cleanup code registered for the process to run. compressed_content_encoding Type String Default gzip Set in Config file If the data compression threshold is reached in the payload, the agent compresses data, using gzip compression by default. The config option compression_content_encoding can be set to deflate to use deflate compression. Heroku heroku.use_dyno_names Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_USE_DYNO_NAMES If true, the agent uses Heroku dyno names as the hostname. heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten Type Array Default [\"scheduler\", \"run\"] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_DYNO_NAME_PREFIXES_TO_SHORTEN Ordinarily the agent reports dyno names with a trailing dot and process ID (for example, worker.3). You can remove this trailing data by specifying the prefixes you want to report without trailing data (for example, worker). Built-in instrumentation The Python agent instruments a range of Python packages/modules. This instrumentation only occurs when the target Python package/module is imported by an application. To disable default instrumentation, provide a special import-hook section corresponding to the name of the module that triggered instrumentation. Then set the enabled setting to false to disable instrumentation of that module. Example: Disabling MySQLdb database query instrumentation Add the following to the configuration file: [import-hook:MySQLdb] enabled = false Copy",
      "info": "",

These key-value pairs can be viewed within transaction traces in APM, traced errors in APM, transaction events in dashboards, and page views in dashboards. You can customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. These attribute settings apply to version 3.12.0 or higher of the Ruby agent. Ruby agent attributes The following table lists the attributes that can be automatically captured by the Ruby agent: httpResponseCode The response status code for a web request. Defaults: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Page views (browser monitoring): Unavailable Note: The httpResponseCode attribute (string value) is deprecated as of agent version 6.12.0. http.statusCode (integer value) should be used instead. request.headers.referer The HTTP referrer header if present (minus the query string).

      "body": "Our Python agent lets you change the default agent behavior agent using configuration options. The only required Python agent configuration setting is the license key. The license key identifies the account where the agent reports application data. Depending on how you are hosting your application, the license key can be provided via a configuration file or an environment variable. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Python agent is via the configuration file, which is generated as part of the standard install process. It is also possible to set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI or by using environment variables. You can also specify some settings on a per-request basis by passing settings with the WSGI request environ dictionary. The Python agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: With the Python agent, per-request options override server-side config. If enabled, server-side config overrides all corresponding values in the agent config file, even if the server-side values are left blank. The agent config file overrides environment variables. Environment variables override the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file Typically you configure your Python agent from a local configuration file on the agent's host system. Supply the path to the config file at startup using one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the path to the config file as the first argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you use the newrelic-admin wrapper script, you must use the environment variable because the wrapper script calls the agent automatically. The configuration file uses a structure similar to Microsoft Windows .ini files. For more information, see the Python ConfigParser module's file format documentation. Tip A sample configuration file is included with the Python agent as newrelic/newrelic.ini. You can also generate one from the newrelic-admin script using the generate-config command, or download a copy from our download repo. Server-side configuration Tip Owner or Admins Server-side configuration allows you to configure certain settings in the New Relic One UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. Important If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the config file that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty string and does not use the agent config file. Environment variables Environment variables allow you to override the defaults for certain core settings. If the equivalent setting is explicitly listed in the agent config file, the config file settings take precedence over the environment variable. Where available, environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. For simple configurations, you can use the environment variables in conjunction with server-side configuration and avoid the agent config file altogether. This is the default setup with Heroku, where installing the New Relic add-on automatically populates the necessary environment variables. Environment variable Configuration setting NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY license_key NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME app_name NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE monitor_mode NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE developer_mode NEW_RELIC_LOG log_file NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL log_level NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY high_security NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME proxy_scheme NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST proxy_host NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT proxy_port NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER proxy_user NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS proxy_pass NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG audit_log_file NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT startup_timeout NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT shutdown_timeout NEW_RELIC_LABELS labels NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME process_host.display_name NEW_RELIC_API_KEY api_key NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH ca_bundle_path NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED distributed_tracing.enabled NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG feature_flag Per-request configuration For certain WSGI servers, you can override the app name and capture attributes settings on a per-request basis. This is possible with WSGI servers where you can define additional key/value pairs that are passed into the per-request WSGI environ dictionary. Set these values with the strings on, off, true, false, 1 and 0. If set from a configuration mechanism implemented using Python code, Python objects evaluating to True or False will also be accepted. Example: Apache/mod_wsgi app name In the Apache/mod_wsgi server, you can use the SetEnv directive to override config settings (optionally inside a Location or Directory block). For example, you could override the app name for a complete virtual host, or for a subset of URLs handled by the WSGI application for that virtual host. In addition to being able to override certain agent configuration settings, you can set other per-request configuration settings with their WSGI environment key: newrelic.set_background_task If set to true, this web transaction will instead be reported as a non-web transaction. newrelic.ignore_transaction If set to true, this web transaction will not be reported. newrelic.suppress_apdex_metric If set to true, no Apdex metric will be generated for this web transaction. newrelic.suppress_transaction_trace If set to true, this web transaction cannot be recorded in a transaction trace. newrelic.disable_browser_autorum If set to true, this disables automatic insertion of the JavaScript header/footer for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). Only applicable if auto-insertion is available for your web framework. Important Using a WSGI middleware to set these values will not work where the Python agent's own WSGI application wrapper was applied at an outer scope. In these cases you must make calls to the agent API to achieve the same outcome. Multiple environment configuration The agent reads its primary configuration from an agent config section called newrelic. You can provide overrides for specific deployment environments (for example, Development, Staging, Production) in additional sections. Preface these sections with [newrelic:environment], where environment is replaced with the name of your environment. To specify that the agent should use an environment-based configuration, use one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the environment name as the second argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT environment variable to the environment name. If no environment is specified, the agent will use the default settings as specified in the newrelic agent config section. The basic structure of the configuration file is: [newrelic] ... default settings [newrelic:development] ... override settings [newrelic:staging] ... override settings [newrelic:production] ... override settings Copy General configuration settings These settings are available in the agent configuration file. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Specifies the license key of your New Relic account. This key associates your app's metrics with your New Relic account. app_name (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Type String Default Python Application Set in Per-request option, config file, environment variable Per-request option newrelic.app_name Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic One UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon ;. Do not put a space before the semicolon, which causes the Python config parser to interpret the name as an embedded comment. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent collects performance data about your app and reports this data to our data collector. developer_mode Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE When true, the agent will instrument your web app, but will not send any actual data. In this offline mode, you will not be billed for an active agent. Use developer mode to test new versions of the agent, or test the agent against third-party packages in a developer environment. Offline mode is not a way of running the APM locally, because the metrics the agent collects are not reported anywhere. log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Sets the name of a log file, which is useful for debugging issues with the agent. This is not set by default, since the agent does not know your web app process's parent user or what directories that process has permission to write to. For detailed information, see Python agent logging. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct, and that the user that your web application runs as can write to the file. Tip Use an absolute path unless you are sure what the working directory of your application will be at startup. If you can't write out a log file, you can also use stderr and output to standard error output. This would normally result in output appearing in your web server log. log_level Type String Default info Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages, if you've set the log file location. This log_level will not affect the Python logging module log level. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are critical, error, warning, info, and debug. To report agent issues, the most useful setting is debug. However, debug generates a lot of information very quickly, so do not keep the agent at this level for longer than it takes to reproduce your problem. high_security Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data is sent to us. Enabling high security mode means that request parameters are not collected, and you cannot send raw SQL. To activate high security mode, set it to true in the local .ini configuration file and activate it in the Account Settings in the UI. For more information, see High security. proxy_scheme, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass Type Strings Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variables NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS By default, the Python agent attempts to directly connect to our servers. If there is a firewall between your host and the our collector that requires you to use an HTTP proxy, set proxy_host and proxy_port to the required values for your HTTP proxy. If proxy authentication is implemented by the HTTP proxy, also set proxy_user and proxy_pass. The proxy_scheme setting dictates what protocol scheme is used to talk to the HTTP proxy. When set to http, the agent uses a SSL tunnel through the HTTP proxy for end-to-end encryption. Instead of setting the proxy_scheme, proxy_host and proxy_port settings, you can also set the proxy_host setting to a valid URI for the proxy. Include the scheme, host, and port; for example, http://proxy-host:8000. This also works if you set the details of the HTTP proxy with the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST environment variable. Tip Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending whether ssl is disabled or enabled. If you are upgrading from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the ssl setting for backwards compatibility. As proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme, not setting proxy_scheme may result in a failure. audit_log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG Sets the name of the audit log file. If set, the agent logs details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the collector. This allows you to evaluate the security of the Python agent. Use an absolute path unless you are sure what your app's working directory will be at startup. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. Also ensure your web app's parent user can write to the file. Caution Do not use audit logging on an ongoing basis, especially in a production environment. Because the agent does not truncate or rotate the log file, the log file can grow very quickly. labels (tags) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS Adds tags. Specify name:value separated by a colon :, and separate additional tags with semicolons ;. Two tags Server:One;Data Center:Primary Copy process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. api_key Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_KEY Sets the api_key to be used with newrelic-admin record-deploy. ca_bundle_path Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 4.2.0 and newer. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T We'll record transaction traces when they exceed this threshold. The format is a number of seconds (decimal points allowed). See our glossary entry for apdex_t Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. In addition to configuring attributes for all four destinations with the general attribute settings below, they can also be configured on a per-destination basis. For more information, see Python agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes, and Attribute examples. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. Transaction tracer configuration Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. The agent automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? If enabled, the transaction tracer captures deep information about slow transactions. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Positive float or string (apdex_f) Default apdex_f Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds this threshold, the agent records a transaction trace. Valid values are any positive float, or apdex_f (four times apdex_t). transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default obfuscated Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Record SQL? When the transaction tracer is enabled, the agent can record SQL statements. The recorder has three modes: off (sends no SQL), raw (sends the SQL statement in its original form), and obfuscated (strips out numeric and string literals). Most web frameworks (including Django) parameterize SQL queries so they do not actually contain the values used to fill out the query. If you use raw mode with one of these frameworks, the Python agent will only see the SQL prior to insertion of values. The parametrized SQL will look much like obfuscated mode. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Stack trace threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack traces from SQL calls. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent captures the current stack trace. This is helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate in an application. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable SQL query plans? Determines whether the Python agent will capture query plans for slow SQL queries. Only supported in MySQL and PostgreSQL. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Query plan threshold Queries in transaction traces that exceed this threshold will report slow query data and any available explain plans. Explain plan collection will not happen if transaction_tracer.explain_enabled is false. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.function_trace Type String Default (none) Set in Config file For the specified functions or methods, the agent will capture additional function timing instrumentation. Specify these names in the form module:function or module:class.function. Transaction segment configuration Here are Transaction segment settings available via the agent configuration file. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for segments of transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to segments of transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_segments.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for segments of transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_segments.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Error collector configuration Here are error collector settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable error collection? If enabled, the error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions. error_collector.ignore_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these errors To stop collecting specific errors, set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to ignore. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip Before version 6.4.0 of the agent, this setting was named error_collector.ignore_errors. If your configuration file still uses ignore_errors, update your agent to use ignore_classes. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default 100-102 200-208 226 300-308 404 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these status codes Lists HTTP status codes which the agent should ignore rather than record as errors. List additional status codes as integers separated by spaces, and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To add one of the default codes to your allow list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option can only be set in server-side configuration in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these error class names Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to be expected. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these status codes Prevents specified HTTP status codes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. List status codes as integers separated by spaces and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To negate one of the codes in your list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python Agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless on how this configuration setting (error_collector.attributes.enabled) is set. error_collector.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file If enabled, the error collector captures event data for advanced analytics. For more information, see APM Errors. Browser monitoring settings Here are browser monitoring settings available via the agent configuration file. browser_monitoring.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables browser monitoring. For more information, see Page load timing in Python. Important Before enabling browser monitoring in the config file, enable it in the application settings in the browser monitoring UI. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file For supported Python web frameworks, this setting enables auto-insertion of the browser monitoring JavaScript fragments. browser_monitoring.content_type Type String Default text/html Set in Config file Specify the HTML Content-Type(s) that our browser monitoring agent should auto-instrument. Add additional entries in a space-separated list. Instrument xhtml+xml page responses If you are generating HTML page responses and using the Content-Type of application/xhtml+xml, you can override the allowed content types to list both this content type and the default text/html by using: browser_monitoring.content_type = text/html application/xhtml+xml Copy Important The browser monitoring JavaScript snippet prevents the page from validating as application/xhtml+xml, although the page should load and render in end-user browsers. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data which gets sent to page view events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how the configuration setting (browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled) is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Transaction events settings Here are Transaction events settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip These configuration settings used to be called analytic_events. If your configuration file still uses analytic_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. transaction_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Transaction event data allows the use of additional information such as histograms and percentiles. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_events.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_events.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in transaction events. Note that excluding attributes from transaction events does not exclude from span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events settings Here are custom events settings available via the agent configuration file. custom_insights_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Allow recording of events to the Insights custom events API via record_custom_event(). Datastore tracer settings These datastore tracer settings are available via the agent configuration file: datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are also reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects database name for some database drivers. The database name is reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. Distributed tracing settings Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Python agent version 4.2.0.100 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Settings include: distributed_tracing.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. Span event configuration Span events are collected for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Configuration options include: span_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off whether the Python agent sends spans. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off for all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this configuration setting (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Event harvest configuration Event harvest settings limit the amount of event type data sent to New Relic. When you use these settings, consider these important points: Event harvest settings affect the limits for a single instance of the agent, and not across the entire application. See the usage example below for how to set limits across an entire application. Real time streaming sends data every five seconds (12 times per minute), but the event harvest settings still affect the rate in events per minute. Enabling or disabling real time streaming does not require changing these settings. With real time streaming (enabled by default), New Relic will display the event harvest limits for entities in five second intervals. This means, for example, when you set a limit value of 1200 in the config file, you'll see it as 100 in New Relic. Usage example Let's say an application is deployed across 10 hosts, each running four processes per host. To limit the number of span events to 10,000 events per minute for the entire application, divide that number by 10 hosts. Then divide again by four processes per host. 10000 / (10 * 4) = 250 Based on that calculation, the final setting is: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data = 250 Event harvest configuration settings include: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.analytic_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for analytic events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.custom_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for custom events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Custom events are created through the Python Telemetry SDK. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data Type Integer Default 1000 Set in Config file Limit for span events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.error_event_data Type Integer Default 100 Set in Config file Limit for error events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Event loop visibility settings Important Requires Python agent version 5.0.0.124 or higher. Event loop visibility surfaces information about transactions that block the event loop. The agent will generate information about transactions that have waited a significant amount of time to acquire control of the event loop. Settings include: event_loop_visibility.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Set this to false to disable event loop information. event_loop_visibility.blocking_threshold Type Float Default 0.1 Set in Config file Threshold in seconds for how long a transaction must block the event loop before generating event loop information. Garbage collection runtime metrics settings Important Requires Python agent version 6.2.0.156 or higher. These garbage collection runtime metrics settings are available via the agent configuration file: gc_runtime_metrics.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file When enabled, the agent will generate and send garbage collection metrics. gc_runtime_metrics.top_object_count_limit Type Integer Default 5 Set in Config file The agent reports object count metrics for the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector. For each object type, this setting allows you to set the maximum number of individual metrics that will be sampled. Other configuration settings Here are assorted other settings available via the agent configuration file. utilization.detect_aws Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an AWS environment. utilization.detect_azure Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an Azure environment. utilization.detect_gcp Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Google Cloud Platform environment. utilization.detect_pcf Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment. utilization.detect_docker Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in Docker. slow_sql.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable Slow SQL? If enabled, the agent captures details from long-running SQL database queries. thread_profiler.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable thread profiler? Enables you to schedule thread profiling sessions. The thread profiler will periodically capture a snapshot of the call stack for each active thread in the application to construct a statistically representative call tree. cross_application_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables cross application tracing, which connect your apps and services within your service-oriented architecture. strip_exception_messages.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file If enabled, exception messages will be stripped from error traces before they are sent to the collector, in order to prevent the inadvertent capture of sensitive information. This option is automatically enabled in high security mode. strip_exception_messages.whitelist Type String Default (none) Set in Config file Exceptions listed in your allow list will not have their messages stripped, even if strip_exception_messages.enabled is true. The allow list is a space-separated string of exception types, each in the form of module:exception_name. List built-in exceptions as exception_name; you do not need to prepend module: to them. Example: Built-in exception and user-defined exception KeyError my_module:MyException Copy startup_timeout Type Float Default 0.0 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT By default, the agent starts when it receives the first transaction (either web or non-web). The agent then starts in parallel, ensuring that this initial request is not delayed. However, the agent does not record the details of this initial request because the agent cannot collect data until registration is complete. To override this, you can set a startup timeout in seconds. The agent will then pause the initial transaction and wait for registration to complete. Important Since startup_timeout delays your app start, we recommend only setting a startup timeout for background task queuing systems, not web applications. shutdown_timeout Type Float Default 2.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT On process shutdown, the agent attempts one final upload to the collector. To prevent the agent running indefinitely in case of an issue, the process shuts down normally if the shutdown_timeout threshold is reached. This shutdown can result in data loss, but the agent prioritizes key metric data during the upload process. For background task queuing systems, especially those which run a small number of tasks per process, you may want to increase the shutdown timeout to ensure the agent can upload all data on process shutdown. Tip The agent defaults to a 2.5 second timeout because Apache and many other web servers have a 3.0 second process termination timeout. The agent exits at 2.5 seconds to allow atexit cleanup code registered for the process to run. compressed_content_encoding Type String Default gzip Set in Config file If the data compression threshold is reached in the payload, the agent compresses data, using gzip compression by default. The config option compression_content_encoding can be set to deflate to use deflate compression. Heroku heroku.use_dyno_names Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_USE_DYNO_NAMES If true, the agent uses Heroku dyno names as the hostname. heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten Type Array Default [\"scheduler\", \"run\"] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_DYNO_NAME_PREFIXES_TO_SHORTEN Ordinarily the agent reports dyno names with a trailing dot and process ID (for example, worker.3). You can remove this trailing data by specifying the prefixes you want to report without trailing data (for example, worker). Built-in instrumentation The Python agent instruments a range of Python packages/modules. This instrumentation only occurs when the target Python package/module is imported by an application. To disable default instrumentation, provide a special import-hook section corresponding to the name of the module that triggered instrumentation. Then set the enabled setting to false to disable instrumentation of that module. Example: Disabling MySQLdb database query instrumentation Add the following to the configuration file: [import-hook:MySQLdb] enabled = false Copy",

      "body": "Our Python agent lets you change the default agent behavior agent using configuration options. The only required Python agent configuration setting is the license key. The license key identifies the account where the agent reports application data. Depending on how you are hosting your application, the license key can be provided via a configuration file or an environment variable. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Python agent is via the configuration file, which is generated as part of the standard install process. It is also possible to set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI or by using environment variables. You can also specify some settings on a per-request basis by passing settings with the WSGI request environ dictionary. The Python agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: With the Python agent, per-request options override server-side config. If enabled, server-side config overrides all corresponding values in the agent config file, even if the server-side values are left blank. The agent config file overrides environment variables. Environment variables override the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file Typically you configure your Python agent from a local configuration file on the agent's host system. Supply the path to the config file at startup using one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the path to the config file as the first argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you use the newrelic-admin wrapper script, you must use the environment variable because the wrapper script calls the agent automatically. The configuration file uses a structure similar to Microsoft Windows .ini files. For more information, see the Python ConfigParser module's file format documentation. Tip A sample configuration file is included with the Python agent as newrelic/newrelic.ini. You can also generate one from the newrelic-admin script using the generate-config command, or download a copy from our download repo. Server-side configuration Tip Owner or Admins Server-side configuration allows you to configure certain settings in the New Relic One UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. Important If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the config file that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty string and does not use the agent config file. Environment variables Environment variables allow you to override the defaults for certain core settings. If the equivalent setting is explicitly listed in the agent config file, the config file settings take precedence over the environment variable. Where available, environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. For simple configurations, you can use the environment variables in conjunction with server-side configuration and avoid the agent config file altogether. This is the default setup with Heroku, where installing the New Relic add-on automatically populates the necessary environment variables. Environment variable Configuration setting NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY license_key NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME app_name NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE monitor_mode NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE developer_mode NEW_RELIC_LOG log_file NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL log_level NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY high_security NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME proxy_scheme NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST proxy_host NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT proxy_port NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER proxy_user NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS proxy_pass NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG audit_log_file NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT startup_timeout NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT shutdown_timeout NEW_RELIC_LABELS labels NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME process_host.display_name NEW_RELIC_API_KEY api_key NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH ca_bundle_path NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED distributed_tracing.enabled NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG feature_flag Per-request configuration For certain WSGI servers, you can override the app name and capture attributes settings on a per-request basis. This is possible with WSGI servers where you can define additional key/value pairs that are passed into the per-request WSGI environ dictionary. Set these values with the strings on, off, true, false, 1 and 0. If set from a configuration mechanism implemented using Python code, Python objects evaluating to True or False will also be accepted. Example: Apache/mod_wsgi app name In the Apache/mod_wsgi server, you can use the SetEnv directive to override config settings (optionally inside a Location or Directory block). For example, you could override the app name for a complete virtual host, or for a subset of URLs handled by the WSGI application for that virtual host. In addition to being able to override certain agent configuration settings, you can set other per-request configuration settings with their WSGI environment key: newrelic.set_background_task If set to true, this web transaction will instead be reported as a non-web transaction. newrelic.ignore_transaction If set to true, this web transaction will not be reported. newrelic.suppress_apdex_metric If set to true, no Apdex metric will be generated for this web transaction. newrelic.suppress_transaction_trace If set to true, this web transaction cannot be recorded in a transaction trace. newrelic.disable_browser_autorum If set to true, this disables automatic insertion of the JavaScript header/footer for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). Only applicable if auto-insertion is available for your web framework. Important Using a WSGI middleware to set these values will not work where the Python agent's own WSGI application wrapper was applied at an outer scope. In these cases you must make calls to the agent API to achieve the same outcome. Multiple environment configuration The agent reads its primary configuration from an agent config section called newrelic. You can provide overrides for specific deployment environments (for example, Development, Staging, Production) in additional sections. Preface these sections with [newrelic:environment], where environment is replaced with the name of your environment. To specify that the agent should use an environment-based configuration, use one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the environment name as the second argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT environment variable to the environment name. If no environment is specified, the agent will use the default settings as specified in the newrelic agent config section. The basic structure of the configuration file is: [newrelic] ... default settings [newrelic:development] ... override settings [newrelic:staging] ... override settings [newrelic:production] ... override settings Copy General configuration settings These settings are available in the agent configuration file. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Specifies the license key of your New Relic account. This key associates your app's metrics with your New Relic account. app_name (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Type String Default Python Application Set in Per-request option, config file, environment variable Per-request option newrelic.app_name Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic One UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon ;. Do not put a space before the semicolon, which causes the Python config parser to interpret the name as an embedded comment. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent collects performance data about your app and reports this data to our data collector. developer_mode Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE When true, the agent will instrument your web app, but will not send any actual data. In this offline mode, you will not be billed for an active agent. Use developer mode to test new versions of the agent, or test the agent against third-party packages in a developer environment. Offline mode is not a way of running the APM locally, because the metrics the agent collects are not reported anywhere. log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Sets the name of a log file, which is useful for debugging issues with the agent. This is not set by default, since the agent does not know your web app process's parent user or what directories that process has permission to write to. For detailed information, see Python agent logging. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct, and that the user that your web application runs as can write to the file. Tip Use an absolute path unless you are sure what the working directory of your application will be at startup. If you can't write out a log file, you can also use stderr and output to standard error output. This would normally result in output appearing in your web server log. log_level Type String Default info Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages, if you've set the log file location. This log_level will not affect the Python logging module log level. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are critical, error, warning, info, and debug. To report agent issues, the most useful setting is debug. However, debug generates a lot of information very quickly, so do not keep the agent at this level for longer than it takes to reproduce your problem. high_security Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data is sent to us. Enabling high security mode means that request parameters are not collected, and you cannot send raw SQL. To activate high security mode, set it to true in the local .ini configuration file and activate it in the Account Settings in the UI. For more information, see High security. proxy_scheme, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass Type Strings Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variables NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS By default, the Python agent attempts to directly connect to our servers. If there is a firewall between your host and the our collector that requires you to use an HTTP proxy, set proxy_host and proxy_port to the required values for your HTTP proxy. If proxy authentication is implemented by the HTTP proxy, also set proxy_user and proxy_pass. The proxy_scheme setting dictates what protocol scheme is used to talk to the HTTP proxy. When set to http, the agent uses a SSL tunnel through the HTTP proxy for end-to-end encryption. Instead of setting the proxy_scheme, proxy_host and proxy_port settings, you can also set the proxy_host setting to a valid URI for the proxy. Include the scheme, host, and port; for example, http://proxy-host:8000. This also works if you set the details of the HTTP proxy with the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST environment variable. Tip Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending whether ssl is disabled or enabled. If you are upgrading from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the ssl setting for backwards compatibility. As proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme, not setting proxy_scheme may result in a failure. audit_log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG Sets the name of the audit log file. If set, the agent logs details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the collector. This allows you to evaluate the security of the Python agent. Use an absolute path unless you are sure what your app's working directory will be at startup. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. Also ensure your web app's parent user can write to the file. Caution Do not use audit logging on an ongoing basis, especially in a production environment. Because the agent does not truncate or rotate the log file, the log file can grow very quickly. labels (tags) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS Adds tags. Specify name:value separated by a colon :, and separate additional tags with semicolons ;. Two tags Server:One;Data Center:Primary Copy process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. api_key Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_KEY Sets the api_key to be used with newrelic-admin record-deploy. ca_bundle_path Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 4.2.0 and newer. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T We'll record transaction traces when they exceed this threshold. The format is a number of seconds (decimal points allowed). See our glossary entry for apdex_t Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. In addition to configuring attributes for all four destinations with the general attribute settings below, they can also be configured on a per-destination basis. For more information, see Python agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes, and Attribute examples. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. Transaction tracer configuration Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. The agent automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? If enabled, the transaction tracer captures deep information about slow transactions. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Positive float or string (apdex_f) Default apdex_f Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds this threshold, the agent records a transaction trace. Valid values are any positive float, or apdex_f (four times apdex_t). transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default obfuscated Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Record SQL? When the transaction tracer is enabled, the agent can record SQL statements. The recorder has three modes: off (sends no SQL), raw (sends the SQL statement in its original form), and obfuscated (strips out numeric and string literals). Most web frameworks (including Django) parameterize SQL queries so they do not actually contain the values used to fill out the query. If you use raw mode with one of these frameworks, the Python agent will only see the SQL prior to insertion of values. The parametrized SQL will look much like obfuscated mode. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Stack trace threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack traces from SQL calls. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent captures the current stack trace. This is helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate in an application. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable SQL query plans? Determines whether the Python agent will capture query plans for slow SQL queries. Only supported in MySQL and PostgreSQL. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Query plan threshold Queries in transaction traces that exceed this threshold will report slow query data and any available explain plans. Explain plan collection will not happen if transaction_tracer.explain_enabled is false. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.function_trace Type String Default (none) Set in Config file For the specified functions or methods, the agent will capture additional function timing instrumentation. Specify these names in the form module:function or module:class.function. Transaction segment configuration Here are Transaction segment settings available via the agent configuration file. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for segments of transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to segments of transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_segments.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for segments of transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_segments.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Error collector configuration Here are error collector settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable error collection? If enabled, the error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions. error_collector.ignore_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these errors To stop collecting specific errors, set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to ignore. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip Before version 6.4.0 of the agent, this setting was named error_collector.ignore_errors. If your configuration file still uses ignore_errors, update your agent to use ignore_classes. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default 100-102 200-208 226 300-308 404 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these status codes Lists HTTP status codes which the agent should ignore rather than record as errors. List additional status codes as integers separated by spaces, and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To add one of the default codes to your allow list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option can only be set in server-side configuration in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these error class names Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to be expected. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these status codes Prevents specified HTTP status codes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. List status codes as integers separated by spaces and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To negate one of the codes in your list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python Agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless on how this configuration setting (error_collector.attributes.enabled) is set. error_collector.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file If enabled, the error collector captures event data for advanced analytics. For more information, see APM Errors. Browser monitoring settings Here are browser monitoring settings available via the agent configuration file. browser_monitoring.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables browser monitoring. For more information, see Page load timing in Python. Important Before enabling browser monitoring in the config file, enable it in the application settings in the browser monitoring UI. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file For supported Python web frameworks, this setting enables auto-insertion of the browser monitoring JavaScript fragments. browser_monitoring.content_type Type String Default text/html Set in Config file Specify the HTML Content-Type(s) that our browser monitoring agent should auto-instrument. Add additional entries in a space-separated list. Instrument xhtml+xml page responses If you are generating HTML page responses and using the Content-Type of application/xhtml+xml, you can override the allowed content types to list both this content type and the default text/html by using: browser_monitoring.content_type = text/html application/xhtml+xml Copy Important The browser monitoring JavaScript snippet prevents the page from validating as application/xhtml+xml, although the page should load and render in end-user browsers. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data which gets sent to page view events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how the configuration setting (browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled) is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Transaction events settings Here are Transaction events settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip These configuration settings used to be called analytic_events. If your configuration file still uses analytic_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. transaction_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Transaction event data allows the use of additional information such as histograms and percentiles. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_events.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_events.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in transaction events. Note that excluding attributes from transaction events does not exclude from span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events settings Here are custom events settings available via the agent configuration file. custom_insights_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Allow recording of events to the Insights custom events API via record_custom_event(). Datastore tracer settings These datastore tracer settings are available via the agent configuration file: datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are also reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects database name for some database drivers. The database name is reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. Distributed tracing settings Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Python agent version 4.2.0.100 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Settings include: distributed_tracing.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. Span event configuration Span events are collected for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Configuration options include: span_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off whether the Python agent sends spans. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off for all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this configuration setting (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Event harvest configuration Event harvest settings limit the amount of event type data sent to New Relic. When you use these settings, consider these important points: Event harvest settings affect the limits for a single instance of the agent, and not across the entire application. See the usage example below for how to set limits across an entire application. Real time streaming sends data every five seconds (12 times per minute), but the event harvest settings still affect the rate in events per minute. Enabling or disabling real time streaming does not require changing these settings. With real time streaming (enabled by default), New Relic will display the event harvest limits for entities in five second intervals. This means, for example, when you set a limit value of 1200 in the config file, you'll see it as 100 in New Relic. Usage example Let's say an application is deployed across 10 hosts, each running four processes per host. To limit the number of span events to 10,000 events per minute for the entire application, divide that number by 10 hosts. Then divide again by four processes per host. 10000 / (10 * 4) = 250 Based on that calculation, the final setting is: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data = 250 Event harvest configuration settings include: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.analytic_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for analytic events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.custom_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for custom events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Custom events are created through the Python Telemetry SDK. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data Type Integer Default 1000 Set in Config file Limit for span events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.error_event_data Type Integer Default 100 Set in Config file Limit for error events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Event loop visibility settings Important Requires Python agent version 5.0.0.124 or higher. Event loop visibility surfaces information about transactions that block the event loop. The agent will generate information about transactions that have waited a significant amount of time to acquire control of the event loop. Settings include: event_loop_visibility.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Set this to false to disable event loop information. event_loop_visibility.blocking_threshold Type Float Default 0.1 Set in Config file Threshold in seconds for how long a transaction must block the event loop before generating event loop information. Garbage collection runtime metrics settings Important Requires Python agent version 6.2.0.156 or higher. These garbage collection runtime metrics settings are available via the agent configuration file: gc_runtime_metrics.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file When enabled, the agent will generate and send garbage collection metrics. gc_runtime_metrics.top_object_count_limit Type Integer Default 5 Set in Config file The agent reports object count metrics for the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector. For each object type, this setting allows you to set the maximum number of individual metrics that will be sampled. Other configuration settings Here are assorted other settings available via the agent configuration file. utilization.detect_aws Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an AWS environment. utilization.detect_azure Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an Azure environment. utilization.detect_gcp Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Google Cloud Platform environment. utilization.detect_pcf Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment. utilization.detect_docker Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in Docker. slow_sql.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable Slow SQL? If enabled, the agent captures details from long-running SQL database queries. thread_profiler.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable thread profiler? Enables you to schedule thread profiling sessions. The thread profiler will periodically capture a snapshot of the call stack for each active thread in the application to construct a statistically representative call tree. cross_application_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables cross application tracing, which connect your apps and services within your service-oriented architecture. strip_exception_messages.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file If enabled, exception messages will be stripped from error traces before they are sent to the collector, in order to prevent the inadvertent capture of sensitive information. This option is automatically enabled in high security mode. strip_exception_messages.whitelist Type String Default (none) Set in Config file Exceptions listed in your allow list will not have their messages stripped, even if strip_exception_messages.enabled is true. The allow list is a space-separated string of exception types, each in the form of module:exception_name. List built-in exceptions as exception_name; you do not need to prepend module: to them. Example: Built-in exception and user-defined exception KeyError my_module:MyException Copy startup_timeout Type Float Default 0.0 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT By default, the agent starts when it receives the first transaction (either web or non-web). The agent then starts in parallel, ensuring that this initial request is not delayed. However, the agent does not record the details of this initial request because the agent cannot collect data until registration is complete. To override this, you can set a startup timeout in seconds. The agent will then pause the initial transaction and wait for registration to complete. Important Since startup_timeout delays your app start, we recommend only setting a startup timeout for background task queuing systems, not web applications. shutdown_timeout Type Float Default 2.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT On process shutdown, the agent attempts one final upload to the collector. To prevent the agent running indefinitely in case of an issue, the process shuts down normally if the shutdown_timeout threshold is reached. This shutdown can result in data loss, but the agent prioritizes key metric data during the upload process. For background task queuing systems, especially those which run a small number of tasks per process, you may want to increase the shutdown timeout to ensure the agent can upload all data on process shutdown. Tip The agent defaults to a 2.5 second timeout because Apache and many other web servers have a 3.0 second process termination timeout. The agent exits at 2.5 seconds to allow atexit cleanup code registered for the process to run. compressed_content_encoding Type String Default gzip Set in Config file If the data compression threshold is reached in the payload, the agent compresses data, using gzip compression by default. The config option compression_content_encoding can be set to deflate to use deflate compression. Heroku heroku.use_dyno_names Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_USE_DYNO_NAMES If true, the agent uses Heroku dyno names as the hostname. heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten Type Array Default [\"scheduler\", \"run\"] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_DYNO_NAME_PREFIXES_TO_SHORTEN Ordinarily the agent reports dyno names with a trailing dot and process ID (for example, worker.3). You can remove this trailing data by specifying the prefixes you want to report without trailing data (for example, worker). Built-in instrumentation The Python agent instruments a range of Python packages/modules. This instrumentation only occurs when the target Python package/module is imported by an application. To disable default instrumentation, provide a special import-hook section corresponding to the name of the module that triggered instrumentation. Then set the enabled setting to false to disable instrumentation of that module. Example: Disabling MySQLdb database query instrumentation Add the following to the configuration file: [import-hook:MySQLdb] enabled = false Copy",

      "body": "Our Python agent lets you change the default agent behavior agent using configuration options. The only required Python agent configuration setting is the license key. The license key identifies the account where the agent reports application data. Depending on how you are hosting your application, the license key can be provided via a configuration file or an environment variable. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Python agent is via the configuration file, which is generated as part of the standard install process. It is also possible to set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI or by using environment variables. You can also specify some settings on a per-request basis by passing settings with the WSGI request environ dictionary. The Python agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: With the Python agent, per-request options override server-side config. If enabled, server-side config overrides all corresponding values in the agent config file, even if the server-side values are left blank. The agent config file overrides environment variables. Environment variables override the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file Typically you configure your Python agent from a local configuration file on the agent's host system. Supply the path to the config file at startup using one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the path to the config file as the first argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you use the newrelic-admin wrapper script, you must use the environment variable because the wrapper script calls the agent automatically. The configuration file uses a structure similar to Microsoft Windows .ini files. For more information, see the Python ConfigParser module's file format documentation. Tip A sample configuration file is included with the Python agent as newrelic/newrelic.ini. You can also generate one from the newrelic-admin script using the generate-config command, or download a copy from our download repo. Server-side configuration Tip Owner or Admins Server-side configuration allows you to configure certain settings in the New Relic One UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. Important If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the config file that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty string and does not use the agent config file. Environment variables Environment variables allow you to override the defaults for certain core settings. If the equivalent setting is explicitly listed in the agent config file, the config file settings take precedence over the environment variable. Where available, environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. For simple configurations, you can use the environment variables in conjunction with server-side configuration and avoid the agent config file altogether. This is the default setup with Heroku, where installing the New Relic add-on automatically populates the necessary environment variables. Environment variable Configuration setting NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY license_key NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME app_name NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE monitor_mode NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE developer_mode NEW_RELIC_LOG log_file NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL log_level NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY high_security NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME proxy_scheme NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST proxy_host NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT proxy_port NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER proxy_user NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS proxy_pass NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG audit_log_file NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT startup_timeout NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT shutdown_timeout NEW_RELIC_LABELS labels NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME process_host.display_name NEW_RELIC_API_KEY api_key NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH ca_bundle_path NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED distributed_tracing.enabled NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG feature_flag Per-request configuration For certain WSGI servers, you can override the app name and capture attributes settings on a per-request basis. This is possible with WSGI servers where you can define additional key/value pairs that are passed into the per-request WSGI environ dictionary. Set these values with the strings on, off, true, false, 1 and 0. If set from a configuration mechanism implemented using Python code, Python objects evaluating to True or False will also be accepted. Example: Apache/mod_wsgi app name In the Apache/mod_wsgi server, you can use the SetEnv directive to override config settings (optionally inside a Location or Directory block). For example, you could override the app name for a complete virtual host, or for a subset of URLs handled by the WSGI application for that virtual host. In addition to being able to override certain agent configuration settings, you can set other per-request configuration settings with their WSGI environment key: newrelic.set_background_task If set to true, this web transaction will instead be reported as a non-web transaction. newrelic.ignore_transaction If set to true, this web transaction will not be reported. newrelic.suppress_apdex_metric If set to true, no Apdex metric will be generated for this web transaction. newrelic.suppress_transaction_trace If set to true, this web transaction cannot be recorded in a transaction trace. newrelic.disable_browser_autorum If set to true, this disables automatic insertion of the JavaScript header/footer for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). Only applicable if auto-insertion is available for your web framework. Important Using a WSGI middleware to set these values will not work where the Python agent's own WSGI application wrapper was applied at an outer scope. In these cases you must make calls to the agent API to achieve the same outcome. Multiple environment configuration The agent reads its primary configuration from an agent config section called newrelic. You can provide overrides for specific deployment environments (for example, Development, Staging, Production) in additional sections. Preface these sections with [newrelic:environment], where environment is replaced with the name of your environment. To specify that the agent should use an environment-based configuration, use one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the environment name as the second argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT environment variable to the environment name. If no environment is specified, the agent will use the default settings as specified in the newrelic agent config section. The basic structure of the configuration file is: [newrelic] ... default settings [newrelic:development] ... override settings [newrelic:staging] ... override settings [newrelic:production] ... override settings Copy General configuration settings These settings are available in the agent configuration file. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Specifies the license key of your New Relic account. This key associates your app's metrics with your New Relic account. app_name (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Type String Default Python Application Set in Per-request option, config file, environment variable Per-request option newrelic.app_name Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic One UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon ;. Do not put a space before the semicolon, which causes the Python config parser to interpret the name as an embedded comment. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent collects performance data about your app and reports this data to our data collector. developer_mode Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE When true, the agent will instrument your web app, but will not send any actual data. In this offline mode, you will not be billed for an active agent. Use developer mode to test new versions of the agent, or test the agent against third-party packages in a developer environment. Offline mode is not a way of running the APM locally, because the metrics the agent collects are not reported anywhere. log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Sets the name of a log file, which is useful for debugging issues with the agent. This is not set by default, since the agent does not know your web app process's parent user or what directories that process has permission to write to. For detailed information, see Python agent logging. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct, and that the user that your web application runs as can write to the file. Tip Use an absolute path unless you are sure what the working directory of your application will be at startup. If you can't write out a log file, you can also use stderr and output to standard error output. This would normally result in output appearing in your web server log. log_level Type String Default info Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages, if you've set the log file location. This log_level will not affect the Python logging module log level. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are critical, error, warning, info, and debug. To report agent issues, the most useful setting is debug. However, debug generates a lot of information very quickly, so do not keep the agent at this level for longer than it takes to reproduce your problem. high_security Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data is sent to us. Enabling high security mode means that request parameters are not collected, and you cannot send raw SQL. To activate high security mode, set it to true in the local .ini configuration file and activate it in the Account Settings in the UI. For more information, see High security. proxy_scheme, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass Type Strings Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variables NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS By default, the Python agent attempts to directly connect to our servers. If there is a firewall between your host and the our collector that requires you to use an HTTP proxy, set proxy_host and proxy_port to the required values for your HTTP proxy. If proxy authentication is implemented by the HTTP proxy, also set proxy_user and proxy_pass. The proxy_scheme setting dictates what protocol scheme is used to talk to the HTTP proxy. When set to http, the agent uses a SSL tunnel through the HTTP proxy for end-to-end encryption. Instead of setting the proxy_scheme, proxy_host and proxy_port settings, you can also set the proxy_host setting to a valid URI for the proxy. Include the scheme, host, and port; for example, http://proxy-host:8000. This also works if you set the details of the HTTP proxy with the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST environment variable. Tip Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending whether ssl is disabled or enabled. If you are upgrading from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the ssl setting for backwards compatibility. As proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme, not setting proxy_scheme may result in a failure. audit_log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG Sets the name of the audit log file. If set, the agent logs details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the collector. This allows you to evaluate the security of the Python agent. Use an absolute path unless you are sure what your app's working directory will be at startup. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. Also ensure your web app's parent user can write to the file. Caution Do not use audit logging on an ongoing basis, especially in a production environment. Because the agent does not truncate or rotate the log file, the log file can grow very quickly. labels (tags) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS Adds tags. Specify name:value separated by a colon :, and separate additional tags with semicolons ;. Two tags Server:One;Data Center:Primary Copy process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. api_key Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_KEY Sets the api_key to be used with newrelic-admin record-deploy. ca_bundle_path Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 4.2.0 and newer. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T We'll record transaction traces when they exceed this threshold. The format is a number of seconds (decimal points allowed). See our glossary entry for apdex_t Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. In addition to configuring attributes for all four destinations with the general attribute settings below, they can also be configured on a per-destination basis. For more information, see Python agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes, and Attribute examples. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. Transaction tracer configuration Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. The agent automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? If enabled, the transaction tracer captures deep information about slow transactions. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Positive float or string (apdex_f) Default apdex_f Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds this threshold, the agent records a transaction trace. Valid values are any positive float, or apdex_f (four times apdex_t). transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default obfuscated Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Record SQL? When the transaction tracer is enabled, the agent can record SQL statements. The recorder has three modes: off (sends no SQL), raw (sends the SQL statement in its original form), and obfuscated (strips out numeric and string literals). Most web frameworks (including Django) parameterize SQL queries so they do not actually contain the values used to fill out the query. If you use raw mode with one of these frameworks, the Python agent will only see the SQL prior to insertion of values. The parametrized SQL will look much like obfuscated mode. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Stack trace threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack traces from SQL calls. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent captures the current stack trace. This is helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate in an application. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable SQL query plans? Determines whether the Python agent will capture query plans for slow SQL queries. Only supported in MySQL and PostgreSQL. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Query plan threshold Queries in transaction traces that exceed this threshold will report slow query data and any available explain plans. Explain plan collection will not happen if transaction_tracer.explain_enabled is false. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.function_trace Type String Default (none) Set in Config file For the specified functions or methods, the agent will capture additional function timing instrumentation. Specify these names in the form module:function or module:class.function. Transaction segment configuration Here are Transaction segment settings available via the agent configuration file. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for segments of transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to segments of transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_segments.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for segments of transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_segments.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Error collector configuration Here are error collector settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable error collection? If enabled, the error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions. error_collector.ignore_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these errors To stop collecting specific errors, set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to ignore. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip Before version 6.4.0 of the agent, this setting was named error_collector.ignore_errors. If your configuration file still uses ignore_errors, update your agent to use ignore_classes. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default 100-102 200-208 226 300-308 404 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these status codes Lists HTTP status codes which the agent should ignore rather than record as errors. List additional status codes as integers separated by spaces, and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To add one of the default codes to your allow list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option can only be set in server-side configuration in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these error class names Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to be expected. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these status codes Prevents specified HTTP status codes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. List status codes as integers separated by spaces and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To negate one of the codes in your list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python Agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless on how this configuration setting (error_collector.attributes.enabled) is set. error_collector.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file If enabled, the error collector captures event data for advanced analytics. For more information, see APM Errors. Browser monitoring settings Here are browser monitoring settings available via the agent configuration file. browser_monitoring.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables browser monitoring. For more information, see Page load timing in Python. Important Before enabling browser monitoring in the config file, enable it in the application settings in the browser monitoring UI. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file For supported Python web frameworks, this setting enables auto-insertion of the browser monitoring JavaScript fragments. browser_monitoring.content_type Type String Default text/html Set in Config file Specify the HTML Content-Type(s) that our browser monitoring agent should auto-instrument. Add additional entries in a space-separated list. Instrument xhtml+xml page responses If you are generating HTML page responses and using the Content-Type of application/xhtml+xml, you can override the allowed content types to list both this content type and the default text/html by using: browser_monitoring.content_type = text/html application/xhtml+xml Copy Important The browser monitoring JavaScript snippet prevents the page from validating as application/xhtml+xml, although the page should load and render in end-user browsers. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data which gets sent to page view events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how the configuration setting (browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled) is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Transaction events settings Here are Transaction events settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip These configuration settings used to be called analytic_events. If your configuration file still uses analytic_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. transaction_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Transaction event data allows the use of additional information such as histograms and percentiles. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_events.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_events.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in transaction events. Note that excluding attributes from transaction events does not exclude from span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events settings Here are custom events settings available via the agent configuration file. custom_insights_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Allow recording of events to the Insights custom events API via record_custom_event(). Datastore tracer settings These datastore tracer settings are available via the agent configuration file: datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are also reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects database name for some database drivers. The database name is reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. Distributed tracing settings Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Python agent version 4.2.0.100 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Settings include: distributed_tracing.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. Span event configuration Span events are collected for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Configuration options include: span_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off whether the Python agent sends spans. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off for all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this configuration setting (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Event harvest configuration Event harvest settings limit the amount of event type data sent to New Relic. When you use these settings, consider these important points: Event harvest settings affect the limits for a single instance of the agent, and not across the entire application. See the usage example below for how to set limits across an entire application. Real time streaming sends data every five seconds (12 times per minute), but the event harvest settings still affect the rate in events per minute. Enabling or disabling real time streaming does not require changing these settings. With real time streaming (enabled by default), New Relic will display the event harvest limits for entities in five second intervals. This means, for example, when you set a limit value of 1200 in the config file, you'll see it as 100 in New Relic. Usage example Let's say an application is deployed across 10 hosts, each running four processes per host. To limit the number of span events to 10,000 events per minute for the entire application, divide that number by 10 hosts. Then divide again by four processes per host. 10000 / (10 * 4) = 250 Based on that calculation, the final setting is: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data = 250 Event harvest configuration settings include: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.analytic_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for analytic events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.custom_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for custom events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Custom events are created through the Python Telemetry SDK. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data Type Integer Default 1000 Set in Config file Limit for span events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.error_event_data Type Integer Default 100 Set in Config file Limit for error events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Event loop visibility settings Important Requires Python agent version 5.0.0.124 or higher. Event loop visibility surfaces information about transactions that block the event loop. The agent will generate information about transactions that have waited a significant amount of time to acquire control of the event loop. Settings include: event_loop_visibility.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Set this to false to disable event loop information. event_loop_visibility.blocking_threshold Type Float Default 0.1 Set in Config file Threshold in seconds for how long a transaction must block the event loop before generating event loop information. Garbage collection runtime metrics settings Important Requires Python agent version 6.2.0.156 or higher. These garbage collection runtime metrics settings are available via the agent configuration file: gc_runtime_metrics.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file When enabled, the agent will generate and send garbage collection metrics. gc_runtime_metrics.top_object_count_limit Type Integer Default 5 Set in Config file The agent reports object count metrics for the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector. For each object type, this setting allows you to set the maximum number of individual metrics that will be sampled. Other configuration settings Here are assorted other settings available via the agent configuration file. utilization.detect_aws Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an AWS environment. utilization.detect_azure Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an Azure environment. utilization.detect_gcp Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Google Cloud Platform environment. utilization.detect_pcf Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment. utilization.detect_docker Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in Docker. slow_sql.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable Slow SQL? If enabled, the agent captures details from long-running SQL database queries. thread_profiler.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable thread profiler? Enables you to schedule thread profiling sessions. The thread profiler will periodically capture a snapshot of the call stack for each active thread in the application to construct a statistically representative call tree. cross_application_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables cross application tracing, which connect your apps and services within your service-oriented architecture. strip_exception_messages.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file If enabled, exception messages will be stripped from error traces before they are sent to the collector, in order to prevent the inadvertent capture of sensitive information. This option is automatically enabled in high security mode. strip_exception_messages.whitelist Type String Default (none) Set in Config file Exceptions listed in your allow list will not have their messages stripped, even if strip_exception_messages.enabled is true. The allow list is a space-separated string of exception types, each in the form of module:exception_name. List built-in exceptions as exception_name; you do not need to prepend module: to them. Example: Built-in exception and user-defined exception KeyError my_module:MyException Copy startup_timeout Type Float Default 0.0 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT By default, the agent starts when it receives the first transaction (either web or non-web). The agent then starts in parallel, ensuring that this initial request is not delayed. However, the agent does not record the details of this initial request because the agent cannot collect data until registration is complete. To override this, you can set a startup timeout in seconds. The agent will then pause the initial transaction and wait for registration to complete. Important Since startup_timeout delays your app start, we recommend only setting a startup timeout for background task queuing systems, not web applications. shutdown_timeout Type Float Default 2.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT On process shutdown, the agent attempts one final upload to the collector. To prevent the agent running indefinitely in case of an issue, the process shuts down normally if the shutdown_timeout threshold is reached. This shutdown can result in data loss, but the agent prioritizes key metric data during the upload process. For background task queuing systems, especially those which run a small number of tasks per process, you may want to increase the shutdown timeout to ensure the agent can upload all data on process shutdown. Tip The agent defaults to a 2.5 second timeout because Apache and many other web servers have a 3.0 second process termination timeout. The agent exits at 2.5 seconds to allow atexit cleanup code registered for the process to run. compressed_content_encoding Type String Default gzip Set in Config file If the data compression threshold is reached in the payload, the agent compresses data, using gzip compression by default. The config option compression_content_encoding can be set to deflate to use deflate compression. Heroku heroku.use_dyno_names Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_USE_DYNO_NAMES If true, the agent uses Heroku dyno names as the hostname. heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten Type Array Default [\"scheduler\", \"run\"] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_DYNO_NAME_PREFIXES_TO_SHORTEN Ordinarily the agent reports dyno names with a trailing dot and process ID (for example, worker.3). You can remove this trailing data by specifying the prefixes you want to report without trailing data (for example, worker). Built-in instrumentation The Python agent instruments a range of Python packages/modules. This instrumentation only occurs when the target Python package/module is imported by an application. To disable default instrumentation, provide a special import-hook section corresponding to the name of the module that triggered instrumentation. Then set the enabled setting to false to disable instrumentation of that module. Example: Disabling MySQLdb database query instrumentation Add the following to the configuration file: [import-hook:MySQLdb] enabled = false Copy",

      "body": "Our Python agent lets you change the default agent behavior agent using configuration options. The only required Python agent configuration setting is the license key. The license key identifies the account where the agent reports application data. Depending on how you are hosting your application, the license key can be provided via a configuration file or an environment variable. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Python agent is via the configuration file, which is generated as part of the standard install process. It is also possible to set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI or by using environment variables. You can also specify some settings on a per-request basis by passing settings with the WSGI request environ dictionary. The Python agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: With the Python agent, per-request options override server-side config. If enabled, server-side config overrides all corresponding values in the agent config file, even if the server-side values are left blank. The agent config file overrides environment variables. Environment variables override the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file Typically you configure your Python agent from a local configuration file on the agent's host system. Supply the path to the config file at startup using one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the path to the config file as the first argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you use the newrelic-admin wrapper script, you must use the environment variable because the wrapper script calls the agent automatically. The configuration file uses a structure similar to Microsoft Windows .ini files. For more information, see the Python ConfigParser module's file format documentation. Tip A sample configuration file is included with the Python agent as newrelic/newrelic.ini. You can also generate one from the newrelic-admin script using the generate-config command, or download a copy from our download repo. Server-side configuration Tip Owner or Admins Server-side configuration allows you to configure certain settings in the New Relic One UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. Important If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the config file that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty string and does not use the agent config file. Environment variables Environment variables allow you to override the defaults for certain core settings. If the equivalent setting is explicitly listed in the agent config file, the config file settings take precedence over the environment variable. Where available, environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. For simple configurations, you can use the environment variables in conjunction with server-side configuration and avoid the agent config file altogether. This is the default setup with Heroku, where installing the New Relic add-on automatically populates the necessary environment variables. Environment variable Configuration setting NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY license_key NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME app_name NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE monitor_mode NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE developer_mode NEW_RELIC_LOG log_file NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL log_level NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY high_security NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME proxy_scheme NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST proxy_host NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT proxy_port NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER proxy_user NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS proxy_pass NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG audit_log_file NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT startup_timeout NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT shutdown_timeout NEW_RELIC_LABELS labels NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME process_host.display_name NEW_RELIC_API_KEY api_key NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH ca_bundle_path NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED distributed_tracing.enabled NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG feature_flag Per-request configuration For certain WSGI servers, you can override the app name and capture attributes settings on a per-request basis. This is possible with WSGI servers where you can define additional key/value pairs that are passed into the per-request WSGI environ dictionary. Set these values with the strings on, off, true, false, 1 and 0. If set from a configuration mechanism implemented using Python code, Python objects evaluating to True or False will also be accepted. Example: Apache/mod_wsgi app name In the Apache/mod_wsgi server, you can use the SetEnv directive to override config settings (optionally inside a Location or Directory block). For example, you could override the app name for a complete virtual host, or for a subset of URLs handled by the WSGI application for that virtual host. In addition to being able to override certain agent configuration settings, you can set other per-request configuration settings with their WSGI environment key: newrelic.set_background_task If set to true, this web transaction will instead be reported as a non-web transaction. newrelic.ignore_transaction If set to true, this web transaction will not be reported. newrelic.suppress_apdex_metric If set to true, no Apdex metric will be generated for this web transaction. newrelic.suppress_transaction_trace If set to true, this web transaction cannot be recorded in a transaction trace. newrelic.disable_browser_autorum If set to true, this disables automatic insertion of the JavaScript header/footer for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). Only applicable if auto-insertion is available for your web framework. Important Using a WSGI middleware to set these values will not work where the Python agent's own WSGI application wrapper was applied at an outer scope. In these cases you must make calls to the agent API to achieve the same outcome. Multiple environment configuration The agent reads its primary configuration from an agent config section called newrelic. You can provide overrides for specific deployment environments (for example, Development, Staging, Production) in additional sections. Preface these sections with [newrelic:environment], where environment is replaced with the name of your environment. To specify that the agent should use an environment-based configuration, use one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the environment name as the second argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT environment variable to the environment name. If no environment is specified, the agent will use the default settings as specified in the newrelic agent config section. The basic structure of the configuration file is: [newrelic] ... default settings [newrelic:development] ... override settings [newrelic:staging] ... override settings [newrelic:production] ... override settings Copy General configuration settings These settings are available in the agent configuration file. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Specifies the license key of your New Relic account. This key associates your app's metrics with your New Relic account. app_name (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Type String Default Python Application Set in Per-request option, config file, environment variable Per-request option newrelic.app_name Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic One UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon ;. Do not put a space before the semicolon, which causes the Python config parser to interpret the name as an embedded comment. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent collects performance data about your app and reports this data to our data collector. developer_mode Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE When true, the agent will instrument your web app, but will not send any actual data. In this offline mode, you will not be billed for an active agent. Use developer mode to test new versions of the agent, or test the agent against third-party packages in a developer environment. Offline mode is not a way of running the APM locally, because the metrics the agent collects are not reported anywhere. log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Sets the name of a log file, which is useful for debugging issues with the agent. This is not set by default, since the agent does not know your web app process's parent user or what directories that process has permission to write to. For detailed information, see Python agent logging. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct, and that the user that your web application runs as can write to the file. Tip Use an absolute path unless you are sure what the working directory of your application will be at startup. If you can't write out a log file, you can also use stderr and output to standard error output. This would normally result in output appearing in your web server log. log_level Type String Default info Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages, if you've set the log file location. This log_level will not affect the Python logging module log level. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are critical, error, warning, info, and debug. To report agent issues, the most useful setting is debug. However, debug generates a lot of information very quickly, so do not keep the agent at this level for longer than it takes to reproduce your problem. high_security Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data is sent to us. Enabling high security mode means that request parameters are not collected, and you cannot send raw SQL. To activate high security mode, set it to true in the local .ini configuration file and activate it in the Account Settings in the UI. For more information, see High security. proxy_scheme, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass Type Strings Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variables NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS By default, the Python agent attempts to directly connect to our servers. If there is a firewall between your host and the our collector that requires you to use an HTTP proxy, set proxy_host and proxy_port to the required values for your HTTP proxy. If proxy authentication is implemented by the HTTP proxy, also set proxy_user and proxy_pass. The proxy_scheme setting dictates what protocol scheme is used to talk to the HTTP proxy. When set to http, the agent uses a SSL tunnel through the HTTP proxy for end-to-end encryption. Instead of setting the proxy_scheme, proxy_host and proxy_port settings, you can also set the proxy_host setting to a valid URI for the proxy. Include the scheme, host, and port; for example, http://proxy-host:8000. This also works if you set the details of the HTTP proxy with the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST environment variable. Tip Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending whether ssl is disabled or enabled. If you are upgrading from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the ssl setting for backwards compatibility. As proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme, not setting proxy_scheme may result in a failure. audit_log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG Sets the name of the audit log file. If set, the agent logs details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the collector. This allows you to evaluate the security of the Python agent. Use an absolute path unless you are sure what your app's working directory will be at startup. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. Also ensure your web app's parent user can write to the file. Caution Do not use audit logging on an ongoing basis, especially in a production environment. Because the agent does not truncate or rotate the log file, the log file can grow very quickly. labels (tags) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS Adds tags. Specify name:value separated by a colon :, and separate additional tags with semicolons ;. Two tags Server:One;Data Center:Primary Copy process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. api_key Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_KEY Sets the api_key to be used with newrelic-admin record-deploy. ca_bundle_path Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 4.2.0 and newer. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T We'll record transaction traces when they exceed this threshold. The format is a number of seconds (decimal points allowed). See our glossary entry for apdex_t Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. In addition to configuring attributes for all four destinations with the general attribute settings below, they can also be configured on a per-destination basis. For more information, see Python agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes, and Attribute examples. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. Transaction tracer configuration Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. The agent automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? If enabled, the transaction tracer captures deep information about slow transactions. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Positive float or string (apdex_f) Default apdex_f Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds this threshold, the agent records a transaction trace. Valid values are any positive float, or apdex_f (four times apdex_t). transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default obfuscated Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Record SQL? When the transaction tracer is enabled, the agent can record SQL statements. The recorder has three modes: off (sends no SQL), raw (sends the SQL statement in its original form), and obfuscated (strips out numeric and string literals). Most web frameworks (including Django) parameterize SQL queries so they do not actually contain the values used to fill out the query. If you use raw mode with one of these frameworks, the Python agent will only see the SQL prior to insertion of values. The parametrized SQL will look much like obfuscated mode. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Stack trace threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack traces from SQL calls. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent captures the current stack trace. This is helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate in an application. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable SQL query plans? Determines whether the Python agent will capture query plans for slow SQL queries. Only supported in MySQL and PostgreSQL. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Query plan threshold Queries in transaction traces that exceed this threshold will report slow query data and any available explain plans. Explain plan collection will not happen if transaction_tracer.explain_enabled is false. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.function_trace Type String Default (none) Set in Config file For the specified functions or methods, the agent will capture additional function timing instrumentation. Specify these names in the form module:function or module:class.function. Transaction segment configuration Here are Transaction segment settings available via the agent configuration file. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for segments of transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to segments of transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_segments.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for segments of transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_segments.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Error collector configuration Here are error collector settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable error collection? If enabled, the error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions. error_collector.ignore_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these errors To stop collecting specific errors, set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to ignore. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip Before version 6.4.0 of the agent, this setting was named error_collector.ignore_errors. If your configuration file still uses ignore_errors, update your agent to use ignore_classes. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default 100-102 200-208 226 300-308 404 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these status codes Lists HTTP status codes which the agent should ignore rather than record as errors. List additional status codes as integers separated by spaces, and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To add one of the default codes to your allow list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option can only be set in server-side configuration in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these error class names Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to be expected. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these status codes Prevents specified HTTP status codes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. List status codes as integers separated by spaces and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To negate one of the codes in your list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python Agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless on how this configuration setting (error_collector.attributes.enabled) is set. error_collector.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file If enabled, the error collector captures event data for advanced analytics. For more information, see APM Errors. Browser monitoring settings Here are browser monitoring settings available via the agent configuration file. browser_monitoring.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables browser monitoring. For more information, see Page load timing in Python. Important Before enabling browser monitoring in the config file, enable it in the application settings in the browser monitoring UI. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file For supported Python web frameworks, this setting enables auto-insertion of the browser monitoring JavaScript fragments. browser_monitoring.content_type Type String Default text/html Set in Config file Specify the HTML Content-Type(s) that our browser monitoring agent should auto-instrument. Add additional entries in a space-separated list. Instrument xhtml+xml page responses If you are generating HTML page responses and using the Content-Type of application/xhtml+xml, you can override the allowed content types to list both this content type and the default text/html by using: browser_monitoring.content_type = text/html application/xhtml+xml Copy Important The browser monitoring JavaScript snippet prevents the page from validating as application/xhtml+xml, although the page should load and render in end-user browsers. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data which gets sent to page view events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how the configuration setting (browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled) is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Transaction events settings Here are Transaction events settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip These configuration settings used to be called analytic_events. If your configuration file still uses analytic_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. transaction_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Transaction event data allows the use of additional information such as histograms and percentiles. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_events.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_events.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in transaction events. Note that excluding attributes from transaction events does not exclude from span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events settings Here are custom events settings available via the agent configuration file. custom_insights_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Allow recording of events to the Insights custom events API via record_custom_event(). Datastore tracer settings These datastore tracer settings are available via the agent configuration file: datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are also reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects database name for some database drivers. The database name is reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. Distributed tracing settings Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Python agent version 4.2.0.100 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Settings include: distributed_tracing.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. Span event configuration Span events are collected for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Configuration options include: span_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off whether the Python agent sends spans. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off for all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this configuration setting (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Event harvest configuration Event harvest settings limit the amount of event type data sent to New Relic. When you use these settings, consider these important points: Event harvest settings affect the limits for a single instance of the agent, and not across the entire application. See the usage example below for how to set limits across an entire application. Real time streaming sends data every five seconds (12 times per minute), but the event harvest settings still affect the rate in events per minute. Enabling or disabling real time streaming does not require changing these settings. With real time streaming (enabled by default), New Relic will display the event harvest limits for entities in five second intervals. This means, for example, when you set a limit value of 1200 in the config file, you'll see it as 100 in New Relic. Usage example Let's say an application is deployed across 10 hosts, each running four processes per host. To limit the number of span events to 10,000 events per minute for the entire application, divide that number by 10 hosts. Then divide again by four processes per host. 10000 / (10 * 4) = 250 Based on that calculation, the final setting is: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data = 250 Event harvest configuration settings include: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.analytic_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for analytic events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.custom_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for custom events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Custom events are created through the Python Telemetry SDK. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data Type Integer Default 1000 Set in Config file Limit for span events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.error_event_data Type Integer Default 100 Set in Config file Limit for error events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Event loop visibility settings Important Requires Python agent version 5.0.0.124 or higher. Event loop visibility surfaces information about transactions that block the event loop. The agent will generate information about transactions that have waited a significant amount of time to acquire control of the event loop. Settings include: event_loop_visibility.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Set this to false to disable event loop information. event_loop_visibility.blocking_threshold Type Float Default 0.1 Set in Config file Threshold in seconds for how long a transaction must block the event loop before generating event loop information. Garbage collection runtime metrics settings Important Requires Python agent version 6.2.0.156 or higher. These garbage collection runtime metrics settings are available via the agent configuration file: gc_runtime_metrics.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file When enabled, the agent will generate and send garbage collection metrics. gc_runtime_metrics.top_object_count_limit Type Integer Default 5 Set in Config file The agent reports object count metrics for the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector. For each object type, this setting allows you to set the maximum number of individual metrics that will be sampled. Other configuration settings Here are assorted other settings available via the agent configuration file. utilization.detect_aws Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an AWS environment. utilization.detect_azure Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an Azure environment. utilization.detect_gcp Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Google Cloud Platform environment. utilization.detect_pcf Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment. utilization.detect_docker Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in Docker. slow_sql.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable Slow SQL? If enabled, the agent captures details from long-running SQL database queries. thread_profiler.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable thread profiler? Enables you to schedule thread profiling sessions. The thread profiler will periodically capture a snapshot of the call stack for each active thread in the application to construct a statistically representative call tree. cross_application_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables cross application tracing, which connect your apps and services within your service-oriented architecture. strip_exception_messages.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file If enabled, exception messages will be stripped from error traces before they are sent to the collector, in order to prevent the inadvertent capture of sensitive information. This option is automatically enabled in high security mode. strip_exception_messages.whitelist Type String Default (none) Set in Config file Exceptions listed in your allow list will not have their messages stripped, even if strip_exception_messages.enabled is true. The allow list is a space-separated string of exception types, each in the form of module:exception_name. List built-in exceptions as exception_name; you do not need to prepend module: to them. Example: Built-in exception and user-defined exception KeyError my_module:MyException Copy startup_timeout Type Float Default 0.0 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT By default, the agent starts when it receives the first transaction (either web or non-web). The agent then starts in parallel, ensuring that this initial request is not delayed. However, the agent does not record the details of this initial request because the agent cannot collect data until registration is complete. To override this, you can set a startup timeout in seconds. The agent will then pause the initial transaction and wait for registration to complete. Important Since startup_timeout delays your app start, we recommend only setting a startup timeout for background task queuing systems, not web applications. shutdown_timeout Type Float Default 2.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT On process shutdown, the agent attempts one final upload to the collector. To prevent the agent running indefinitely in case of an issue, the process shuts down normally if the shutdown_timeout threshold is reached. This shutdown can result in data loss, but the agent prioritizes key metric data during the upload process. For background task queuing systems, especially those which run a small number of tasks per process, you may want to increase the shutdown timeout to ensure the agent can upload all data on process shutdown. Tip The agent defaults to a 2.5 second timeout because Apache and many other web servers have a 3.0 second process termination timeout. The agent exits at 2.5 seconds to allow atexit cleanup code registered for the process to run. compressed_content_encoding Type String Default gzip Set in Config file If the data compression threshold is reached in the payload, the agent compresses data, using gzip compression by default. The config option compression_content_encoding can be set to deflate to use deflate compression. Heroku heroku.use_dyno_names Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_USE_DYNO_NAMES If true, the agent uses Heroku dyno names as the hostname. heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten Type Array Default [\"scheduler\", \"run\"] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_DYNO_NAME_PREFIXES_TO_SHORTEN Ordinarily the agent reports dyno names with a trailing dot and process ID (for example, worker.3). You can remove this trailing data by specifying the prefixes you want to report without trailing data (for example, worker). Built-in instrumentation The Python agent instruments a range of Python packages/modules. This instrumentation only occurs when the target Python package/module is imported by an application. To disable default instrumentation, provide a special import-hook section corresponding to the name of the module that triggered instrumentation. Then set the enabled setting to false to disable instrumentation of that module. Example: Disabling MySQLdb database query instrumentation Add the following to the configuration file: [import-hook:MySQLdb] enabled = false Copy",

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the Browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements To report data to Browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute Browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for Browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the Browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the Browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying Browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports Browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The Browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use Browser's SPA monitoring capabilities, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with Browser. In all cases, the Browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our SPA-enabled Browser agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend the Browser Pro agent. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, Browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the Browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The Browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To retrieve synthetics event data, use the Query API. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Telemetry APIs for core data types We offer several APIs that allow you to get our core data types (metrics, logs, traces, and events) into New Relic without the use of an installed agent. Data type Description Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic. Event API Send event data to New Relic. Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage You can use the Query API to retrieve subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API To retrieve information about your New Relic partner account, sub-accounts, and users, use the Partner API. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API To query your data using NRQL-format queries, you can use the Query API. Note that this API is deprecated and NerdGraph is preferred for querying your data. Dashboard API See the Insights Dashboard API. Plugins Use the REST API for New Relic plugins and the API Explorer to: Get a list of plugins, including their names, IDs, and GUIDs. List one or more plugin components, their output, and their metric timeslice data. Developers and New Relic partners can also use New Relic's Plugin API to write an agent in any language that can work directly with the API for plugins. This allows you to send your own metric data to our plugins and view data received from the API in New Relic.

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings.

To update to the latest version, check your version number, then follow the steps to update an APM-managed installation or to upgrade a copy/paste installation. Check your version number To verify your Browser version number: View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet. Search the page source for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-. The numbers that follow nr- are your current version. For example, js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js indicates you are running version 593 of the Browser script. The Pro+SPA agent will have the format js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1184.min.js To verify the latest version of the Browser script loader: Go to js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js . Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your Browser agent. Check deployment method Your Browser agent may have been deployed using the copy/paste method rather than injected with APM. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your Browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed Browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the Browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific Browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your Browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, use the Browser Pro + SPA endpoint, the Browser Pro endpoint, or the Browser Lite endpoint. These endpoints always point to the latest version of the script snippet. Recommendation: Use the Browser Pro or Pro + SPA loaders regardless of your Browser subscription level. These loaders are compatible with both the Pro and Lite subscription levels. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your Browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your Browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The configuration options explained below refer only to the browser agent, and should not to be confused with the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your agent: Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available. If you have problems with your browser installation or if no data appears after five minutes, refer to the troubleshooting tips, and restart your agent.",

In addition to browser monitoring's installation requirements, Browser's AMP agent requires: Browser AMP requirements Comments New Relic Browser New Relic's browser requirements include Browser Pro account, which includes access to New Relic Insights data depending on your Browser subscription level. Browser app ID To capture AMP throughput, browser monitoring needs the app ID for each app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser and select an application from the index. Copy the numeric value that follows /browser/1234567890 in the URL. Browser monitoring license key To obtain only the browser monitoring license key: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > Settings. Select and copy the generated JavaScript, and paste it into a text file. Delete everything in the text file except the browser monitoring license key (just above the ending </script> tag), and save. Install Browser's AMP agent New Relic has partnered with The Amp Project to incorporate New Relic Browser's AMP agent in with the AMP Analytics repo. Before installing, read the requirements. To install the Browser AMP agent into your AMP app: Add the attribute newrelic to your AMP analytics code. For more information, see the AMP site. Add the browser app ID and license key. To send data from one AMP page to multiple Browser apps, include quote marks and a comma to separate each Browser app ID. For example: \"appId\": [\"123\", \"124\", \"125\"] <amp-analytics type=\"newrelic\" id=\"newrelic\"> <script type=\"application/json\"> { \"vars\": { \"appId\": \"\", \"licenseKey\": \"\" } } </script> </amp-analytics> Copy Query AMP events Currently, your AMP data will not appear in the New Relic's browser monitoring UI. This is intentional; any AMP data sent to the New Relic collector will be removed automatically from your browser monitoring metrics. In the meantime, you can run NRQL queries to compare your AMP page to non-AMP pages. The dashboard data provides standard performance key metrics. New Relic stores AMP events in the PageView and BrowserInteraction events. To view the AMP events, run the following NRQL queries: SELECT * FROM BrowserInteraction WHERE mobileOptimized = 'amp' SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE mobileOptimized = 'amp' Here's an example of a dashboard showing AMP event data after you install New Relic Browser's AMP JavaScript snippet into the body of your AMP pages. AMP data dictionary Here's a summary of the AMP data available in BrowserInteraction and PageView. Insights variable AMP parameter appId The New Relic application ID.

      "body": "Running the latest version of Browser monitoring ensures you can access all Browser features and enhancements. To update to the latest version, check your version number, then follow the steps to update an APM-managed installation or to upgrade a copy/paste installation. Check your version number To verify your Browser version number: View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet. Search the page source for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-. The numbers that follow nr- are your current version. For example, js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js indicates you are running version 593 of the Browser script. The Pro+SPA agent will have the format js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1184.min.js To verify the latest version of the Browser script loader: Go to js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js . Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your Browser agent. Check deployment method Your Browser agent may have been deployed using the copy/paste method rather than injected with APM. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your Browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed Browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the Browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific Browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your Browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, use the Browser Pro + SPA endpoint, the Browser Pro endpoint, or the Browser Lite endpoint. These endpoints always point to the latest version of the script snippet. Recommendation: Use the Browser Pro or Pro + SPA loaders regardless of your Browser subscription level. These loaders are compatible with both the Pro and Lite subscription levels. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your Browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your Browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The configuration options explained below refer only to the browser agent, and should not to be confused with the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your agent: Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available. If you have problems with your browser installation or if no data appears after five minutes, refer to the troubleshooting tips, and restart your agent.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the Browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements To report data to Browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute Browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for Browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the Browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the Browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying Browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports Browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The Browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use Browser's SPA monitoring capabilities, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with Browser. In all cases, the Browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our SPA-enabled Browser agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend the Browser Pro agent. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, Browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the Browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The Browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The configuration options explained below refer only to the browser agent, and should not to be confused with the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your agent: Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available. If you have problems with your browser installation or if no data appears after five minutes, refer to the troubleshooting tips, and restart your agent.",

This agent leverages the amp-analytics agent to define the relevant New Relic events and send them to New Relic to be captured for reporting. Compatibility and requirements This private beta is closed. This feature and all related services will be deprecated in July 2021. In addition to browser monitoring's installation requirements, Browser's AMP agent requires: Browser AMP requirements Comments New Relic Browser New Relic's browser requirements include Browser Pro account, which includes access to New Relic Insights data depending on your Browser subscription level. Browser app ID To capture AMP throughput, browser monitoring needs the app ID for each app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser and select an application from the index. Copy the numeric value that follows /browser/1234567890 in the URL. Browser monitoring license key To obtain only the browser monitoring license key: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > Settings. Select and copy the generated JavaScript, and paste it into a text file. Delete everything in the text file except the browser monitoring license key (just above the ending </script> tag), and save. Install Browser's AMP agent New Relic has partnered with The Amp Project to incorporate New Relic Browser's AMP agent in with the AMP Analytics repo. Before installing, read the requirements. To install the Browser AMP agent into your AMP app: Add the attribute newrelic to your AMP analytics code. For more information, see the AMP site. Add the browser app ID and license key. To send data from one AMP page to multiple Browser apps, include quote marks and a comma to separate each Browser app ID. For example: \"appId\": [\"123\", \"124\", \"125\"] <amp-analytics type=\"newrelic\" id=\"newrelic\"> <script type=\"application/json\"> { \"vars\": { \"appId\": \"\", \"licenseKey\": \"\" } } </script> </amp-analytics> Copy Query AMP events Currently, your AMP data will not appear in the New Relic's browser monitoring UI. This is intentional; any AMP data sent to the New Relic collector will be removed automatically from your browser monitoring metrics. In the meantime, you can run NRQL queries to compare your AMP page to non-AMP pages. The dashboard data provides standard performance key metrics. New Relic stores AMP events in the PageView and BrowserInteraction events. To view the AMP events, run the following NRQL queries: SELECT * FROM BrowserInteraction WHERE mobileOptimized = 'amp' SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE mobileOptimized = 'amp' Here's an example of a dashboard showing AMP event data after you install New Relic Browser's AMP JavaScript snippet into the body of your AMP pages.

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the Browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements To report data to Browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute Browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for Browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the Browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the Browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying Browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports Browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The Browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use Browser's SPA monitoring capabilities, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with Browser. In all cases, the Browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our SPA-enabled Browser agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend the Browser Pro agent. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, Browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the Browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The Browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's page load timing feature can track sessions by using cookies that contain a simple session identifier. How it works Here is the basic process for session tracking: A session begins when a user visits a website where New Relic's browser monitoring is installed and cookie collection is enabled. After the user's browser is opened, our browser monitoring script sets a simple cookie identifying the session. The script then reads the cookie on subsequent page loads. The same session will continue until the user's browser is closed.

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the Browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals We now, with the release of agent version 1177, have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint This new metric, available with agent version 1163, largestContentfulPaint, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the w3c draft. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good\", between 100-300 ms considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 300 ms considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see the Browser release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), available with agent v1177, is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good\", between 0.1-0.25 considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 0.25 considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event, available with agent v1177, is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Load event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event, available with agent v1163, is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Unload event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements In addition to Browser's installation requirements, the PageViewTiming event requires Browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Browser Pro subscription. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener Browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile.

      "body": "This document describes data privacy related to Browser monitoring and cookies, and details about the cookies themselves. Page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) creates the following cookies that Browser monitoring uses when session tracking in end-user browsers. Tip These cookies are related to Browser app monitoring. For more information about data privacy and requesting data to be deleted, see New Relic personal data requests. Data privacy and legal compliance The default Browser agent configuration does not retain any personal data as defined by common privacy laws such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). New Relic has taken steps to enable our customers who elect to process personal data in our products to do so in accordance with applicable privacy laws. Use the additional information below to help enable your compliance with such laws: Data Description IP addresses New Relic briefly collects and leverages the IP address from the end-user as part of the data collection process. The IP is captured when a connection is made between the end user's browser and the New Relic data collector. The IP address is included in the web request, much like a caller ID. New Relic uses the IP, much like you see a phone number when somebody calls you. The IP address is used as a lookup value that maps to additional details, allowing New Relic customers to diagnose performance issues. IP address lookup values include: countryCode regionCode city asn (Autonomous System Number) asnOrganization (ISP/Business/Institution) asnLatitude asnLongitude The mapping process for the IP address lookup value is typically complete within minutes, but in some extreme cases may take up to 24 hours to process. Once the mapping process is complete, New Relic no longer retains the IP address. Default cookies The Browser monitoring agent sets cookies by default. Cookies are placed by the Browser agent and the New Relic collector. The New Relic collector places a cookie when the Browser agent makes a connection and transmits data. A cookie consent manager that uses a conditional script loader that only loads tags/snippets when a visitor agrees to a specific type of cookies can be used. By choosing this option there is a risk that page performance will not be captured until the visitor has agreed and the Browser agent is running. With the release of Browser agent v1169, you can turn off cookie collection (JSESSIONID and NREUM) for your Browser app by using the Application settings page in the New Relic UI. Once this configuration value is set to false (OFF), you will no longer see the session information in your event data. By default, the value is set to true (ON) for all existing Browser apps as well as newly created ones. For more information, see our documentation about cookie collection and session tracking. Personal data through custom Browser configuration New Relic offers the option to manually configure your agent through the Browser monitoring API. This could be used to capture personal data, subject to the restrictions set forth in the Terms of Service with New Relic. (For example, no credit card numbers or sensitive categories of personal data, which are contractually prohibited.) New Relic responds to the instructions specified by the agents, including collecting personal data that may be custom configured. If you (as the data controller) receive a request from one of your own customers and determine that personal data sent to New Relic for processing must be deleted, see New Relic personal data requests. JSESSIONID The JSESSIONID cookie is used to store a session identifier so that New Relic can monitor session counts for an application. The cookie value is generated by Jetty. Components Description Session identifier This is used by New Relic to monitor session counts for an application. Domain The JSESSIONID cookie is associated with the New Relic domain. Expiration JSESSIONID is a session cookie that is deleted when the browser closes. NREUM This cookie is only created in browsers that do not support the Navigation Timing API. When a browser supports the Navigation Timing API, a native interface can be used to determine navigation start time. Mozilla Firefox versions 7 or higher support the Navigation Timing API. However, a bug exists in Firefox's early implementations of the Navigation Timing API that Browser monitoring works around by using this cookie. Components Description Navigation start time Navigation start time is required to measure end user response time. The cookie is written when the current page unloads (as the next navigation begins). Document location Stored as a hash. The document location is used with the referring page URL to validate that the start time refers to the page that was previously being viewed or refreshed (to avoid using an invalid start time from a different navigation). Referring page URLs Stored as a hash. The referring page URL is used with the document location to validate that the start time refers to the page that was previously being viewed or refreshed (to avoid using an invalid start time from a different navigation). Domain The NREUM cookie is associated with the root path of the domain in which the New Relic agent executes. Expiration NREUM is a session cookie that is deleted when the browser closes. NRAGENT The NRAGENT cookie is set only if you use Browser agent version v443 or lower. It is created when a token is handed out to an end user by the New Relic collector. End-user metrics are communicated to New Relic collectors via a JSONP request from the browser (script retrieval). The returned JavaScript contains a call to set the token identifier which is written to the cookie on the next navigation (when the page unloads). This achieves a cross-domain communication between the New Relic collector and the New Relic agent. This cookie is used to communicate between the New Relic collector aggregating end user metrics and the agent(s) running in the associated web application. A token identifies and correlates application tier transaction traces with corresponding browser traces. Components Description Token identifier The 16-character token identifier helps with cross-domain communication between the New Relic collector and the New Relic agent. Domain The NRAGENT cookie is associated with the root path of the domain in which the New Relic agent executes. Expiration NRAGENT is a session cookie that is deleted when the browser closes.",

LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good\", between 100-300 ms considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 300 ms considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see the Browser release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), available with agent v1177, is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good\", between 0.1-0.25 considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 0.25 considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event, available with agent v1177, is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Load event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event, available with agent v1163, is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Unload event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements In addition to Browser's installation requirements, the PageViewTiming event requires Browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Browser Pro subscription. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded.

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the Browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals We now, with the release of agent version 1177, have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint This new metric, available with agent version 1163, largestContentfulPaint, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the w3c draft. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content.

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the Browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals We now, with the release of agent version 1177, have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint This new metric, available with agent version 1163, largestContentfulPaint, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the w3c draft. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good\", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 4.0 secs considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good\", between 100-300 ms considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 300 ms considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see the Browser release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), available with agent v1177, is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good\", between 0.1-0.25 considered \"Needs Improvement\", and above 0.25 considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event, available with agent v1177, is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Load event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event, available with agent v1163, is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the Window Unload event can be found in MDN docs. In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements In addition to Browser's installation requirements, the PageViewTiming event requires Browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Browser Pro subscription. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener Browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile.

      "body": "If a browser does not use the Navigation timing API for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM), the browser uses a cookie to determine the navigation start time. If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case Browser monitoring has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region. Failing that, the data is tossed. Note: For browsers that have the Navigation Timing API, this is not an issue, as the navigation start time can be determined without using a cookie.

This JavaScript instrumentation has been designed to: Provide maximum visibility into front-end performance, accurately time how long it takes for pages to load in all browsers, and to report details for JavaScript errors and AJAX calls. Have minimal impact on overall page load time and search engine optimization (SEO), including search engine ranking, indexing, crawl efficiency, or other SEO-related concerns. Contents Efficiency of inline JavaScript The most effective method for Browser monitoring is to include a minimal amount of JavaScript instrumentation code inline in the head of the monitored page. This code then retrieves the remainder of the necessary code after the page finishes loading. Other Browser monitoring methods include JavaScript code at the end of the page body or exclusively using an external script. However, these methods can limit visibility into the end users' experience. Impact on SEO Performance testing results indicate that using Browser monitoring's JavaScript has a negligible effect on page load time. In addition, it has no negative impact on how users or search engines interact with your site. Google's consistent recommendation to website owners is to build a site that is valuable to users and accessible to search engine crawlers. Google rankings favor sites that provide the most relevant information and the best user experience. Browser monitoring can help you improve user experience by identifying performance bottlenecks, including: Slow page loads Problematic JavaScript errors Long AJAX calls Identifying Javascript errors is especially helpful because Google's bots are increasingly running the JavaScript code on websites they crawl in order to access content provided by AJAX-heavy web applications. A JavaScript error that previously was only visible to human users (for example, a broken button) could affect whether the Google bots can successfully interact with your site. We understand that SEO and traffic referred by search engines are critically important to many businesses. When used effectively, Browser monitoring can even increase a site's ranking in Google and other search engines by improving performance and user experience.

      "body": "Browser monitoring provides insights into how your application or site behaves when it is loaded in a web browser. Browser only records performance data, as explained in this document. It does not record any data used or stored by the monitored application unless you explicitly configure it to do so. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Reported data Browser reports many different types of data to help you analyze your website's performance. It only reports page view data, unless you have subscribed to Pro features. You can also enable functionality for AJAX requests, JavaScript errors, and session traces. For most data types, Browser transmits the data securely using HTTPS encryption. The Browser agent transmits data to New Relic's collectors by using either of the domains bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. Here is a summary of the types of data reported by Browser monitoring. Page view data This data is reported once per page view and consists of: Page load timing data Name of the server-side app controller that served the page, if available (obfuscated in the page and during transmission) Additional custom parameters set by the server-side app controller, if available (obfuscated in the page and during transmission) Additional custom parameters set by the Browser agent API, if set prior to page load This information appears on the Page views page. For data security reasons, Browser does not record or collect URL query strings. Server-side data can only be collected when the host is also instrumented by New Relic and the browser monitoring instrumentation is injected by the agent. For more information about how we collect and present this data, see Instrumentation for page load timing. AJAX timing data When enabled, Browser periodically reports AJAX timing data until the user navigates away from or closes the page. (New Relic automatically filters out all AJAX requests that take longer than two minutes.) Data includes: Hostnames, ports, and paths (but not search/query parameters) of AJAX request URLs HTTP status code of responses Byte size of request message bodies Name of the server-side app controller servicing the AJAX request and server-side timing data (obfuscated in the page and during transmission), when the browser instrumentation is injected by the New Relic agent Timing data for the AJAX transaction Timing data for the AJAX callbacks This information appears on the AJAX page. JavaScript error data When enabled, Browser periodically reports data about every error that occurs on the page until the user navigates away from or closes the page. This information appears on the JavaScript errors page. For each error, the data includes: Exception class of the error Error message containing arbitrary text Stack trace of the error, which may contain function names and URLs of scripts causing the error Error messages typically do not contain any confidential or sensitive information. However, it is possible for messages to be purposefully constructed with sensitive information. Before enabling JavaScript error reporting, ensure that your website does not expose any sensitive information in error messages. Session trace data When enabled, Browser periodically reports data on the details of the a single page's life cycle, including user interactions, AJAX loads, and JavaScript errors, until the user navigates away from or closes the page. New Relic automatically stops recording further data after ten minutes. Data includes: Asset load timing details User interactions such as scrolling, mousing, and clicking JavaScript error timing and other JavaScript error information Triggered Javascript events Session traces are captured randomly at a fixed rate from among the monitored page views. Session trace information appears on the Session traces page. SPA data If you use Browser's single-page app (SPA) monitoring, New Relic reports the following data once per page load or route change. Browser data for page views, AJAX timing, JavaScript errors, and session traces Hash fragments associated with SPA route changes Additional custom parameters added from the SPA API When SPA monitoring has been enabled, this information appears on the Page views page. Server-side data can only be collected when the host is also instrumented by New Relic, and the Browser monitoring instrumentation is injected by the agent. For more information about how we collect and present this data, see Instrumentation for page load timing. URL query strings The Browser agent uses the HTTP referer attribute to track page URLs. URLs can sometimes contain potentially sensitive user-entered query data (for example, a user's name). For data security reasons, Browser does not record or collect URL query strings. Visitor's IP address Browser uses the visitor's IP address to enrich data for additional visitor segmentation. Details such as the ASN and geoID are mapped to Browser data from the IP address. For data security reasons, Browser does not retain the visitor's IP address for reporting. The IP address is obtained in the HTTP header from the request to the New Relic collector. New Relic does not retain the visitor's IP address after the attributes have been mapped. The IP address value is overwritten within 24 hours of data being collected. Browser types Browser determines the browser type from the User-Agent header and the geographical location based on the browser's IP address. New Relic does not retain the IP address, only the country and region associated with the performance data. This information appears on the selected app's Geography page. Also, details about specific browser types appear on the selected app's Browsers page. CDN access Page load timing requires access to the content delivery network (CDN), where New Relic's utility JavaScript file (nr.js) is hosted. The domain name for the file (js-agent.newrelic.com) remains static, but the number in the path (version) may change periodically. A script tag is injected by the New Relic agent (or pasted into the webpage for standalone apps) that references the JavaScript on the CDN, which is then loaded by the browser. The loaded JavaScript collects and reports the metrics dynamically to either of the domains bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. Important If your end users are behind a firewall or proxy and do not have access to the CDN or to New Relic's networks (including bam.nr-data.net and bam-cell.nr-data.net), Browser monitoring will not work. Cookies Browser monitoring creates cookies in the end user's browser. If the user has cookies disabled, page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) will not be able to track sessions properly. Also, if the user has an older browser that does not support the Navigation Timing Specification API, page load timing will not be able to track response times as accurately. New Relic's cookies generated by Browser agents older than version 995 may not contain the secure attribute. This is because page load timing data transmission in versions before version 995 use HTTP when the page is HTTP, but use HTTPS when the page is HTTPS. All Browser agent versions above version 995 will always use the secure flag for cookies and transmit over HTTPS. JavaScript and AJAX data may contain more sensitive information, so they are always transmitted over HTTPS. Transmission of these cookies using HTTP or access to them from JavaScript is not a significant security risk, because the cookies are not used to make security decisions or allow access to an account. They are used only to collect performance data, with any identifiable data obfuscated. For customers subject to special guidelines for cookie collection, such as those under the EU GDPR/PECR ICO Guidelines, we now provide the option to disable cookie collection for your application. Please see our Browser agent v1169 release notes for more information. Important If your site uses P3P, it must be configured to allow these cookies. JSONP requests Page load timing metrics are reported to New Relic using a Script GET, also known as a JSONP request. The Script GET returns a value that is subsequently stored in a cookie and used to trigger trace capturing.",

      "body": "New Relic Browser's Filterable Geography page provides a world view with color-coded performance information about cities, regions, and countries anywhere around the world. You can filter and drill down into detailed information, or use your mouse to select or zoom in and out of any location on the map. The enhanced attributes provide deep visibility not only about your end users' experience with page load timing, but also with network performance anywhere around the world. This level of visual detail is especially useful for professionals in IT and Operations to make business decisions about peering agreements and CDN usage. Contents Requirements Your New Relic Browser subscription level and your time picker settings determine what data you can view: Pro or higher: As of January 2016, the Filterable Geography feature automatically appears in your New Relic Browser user interface. No special setup is required. You can view up to eight days of data. Your application must be enabled to send PageView data to New Relic Insights in order to use Filterable Geography. Lite: The Filterable Geography feature appears in your New Relic Browser's UI menu but currently is not available for use. Any subscription level: If you need to use New Relic Browser's legacy Geography feature, you can still view it from your selected browser app. Factors affecting collected data To capture page load timing information, New Relic Browser uses the Navigation Timing API, which most (but not all) browsers support. If the browsers do not support the Navigation Timing API, then New Relic Browser charts and data points can only show the network data they receive for DNS lookup, connection, secure handshake, etc. This may not be 100% of the app's overall traffic. Also, firewalls may have an impact on the geographical data collected about your end users. View performance data by location one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map before drilling down into detailed information about London, England. To view or sort the performance information by location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Select the type of performance data to view from the dropdown, or use the default Average page load time. To drill down to a specific area, mouse over or select any area on the geographical map, or select any of the ten worst performing locations from the list to the right of the map. To view specific performance metrics, select any of the attributes below the funnel icon. To view comparison data, select the Page load performance or Historical performance chart below the selected location's geographical map. Use map functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions and page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the Filterable Geography page. If you want to... Do this... Change what kind of performance data appears Select your choice from the dropdown. Default performance indicator is Average page load time. The map's legend lists the ten best or worst performing areas (depending on the selected performance indicator) for the selected time period. For example: If you select Count, the map's legend shows the top ten locations with the highest number of page loads, as well as the average page load time for each. If you select Connection setup, New Relic Browser first filters out areas with low throughput. Then the map's legend shows the top ten locations where average connection time is the slowest, as well as the average page load time and count for each. View summary performance information about a specific location Mouse over any colored area on the map, select a location from the list, or zoom in and out of any area on the map. View detailed data for a location Select any area of the map. For example: If you select Canada, the map and legend show color-coded performance data for each province and territory. The list to the right of the map shows the top ten worst performing areas. If you select a specific province or territory, the map shows color-coded performance data for the top ten cities. The map includes circled locations which you can mouse over or select to view detailed information. In addition, the Page load performance and Historical performance charts below the map automatically update with each location you select. Hide the list of available attributes Select the funnel icon. Return to a larger world view Select another location on the map, or clear the filter labels above the map. Tip To return to the original map view of the world, select any area on an ocean. Examine heat map details one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map as you use filter and zoom tools to drill down into detailed information about London, England. Athough overall throughput for the area is good (green), the nearby yellow areas, and the smaller red and orange circles indicate nearby cities with varying levels of throughput problems, not the size of those cities. The Filterable Geography heat map identifies performance quality with color and with the size of circles. Heat map Description Color scale Performance quality ranges from green (the best) to yellow, orange, and then red (the worst). When selecting indicators of usage rather than performance, the heat map shows shades of purple, with the darkest shades indicating the highest usage. The color scale adapts to your app's specific performance. Each area is a percentile range. To view the range for each color segment, mouse over the heat map's legend. Thresholds Different thresholds are dynamically applied to the colors based on the type of performance indicator you select from the dropdown and the maximum value your app has reported. For example, green for Average page load time may indicate 0 to 3.3 seconds, while green for Average network time may indicate 0 to 256 milliseconds. Circles The map's colored circles help you identify areas with performance problems at a glance. Each circle's radius is based on throughput reported for the city it represents, not the size of the city itself. You may see many circles overlapping each other. This usually indicates a grouping of metropolitan areas which represent a geographic area of heavy traffic. Filter performance metrics The Filter feature allows you to select and group data by attributes in various categories, including: Page view Geography Browser Identity Custom The filtered results appear on the geographical map, where you can use any of the standard map functions to explore additional details. Here are some examples. Unsatisfactory network performance by ASN In this example, your organization is preparing to renew a peering agreement with the owner of an autonomous system, called \"My-ASN.\" You are concerned that continued outages and other connection issues are affecting customer satisfaction with your site, and you want to compare its performance with other ASNs. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. From the performance type dropdown, select Connection setup. Select the funnel icon. To view the specific ASN's performance: From the search window, type My-ASN, and then select this name from the Filter by results. OR To compare performance with other ASNs: From Geography attributes > ASN organizations, review the performance data for each organization on the list, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filter, select the attribute name. Page rendering performance during sales promotion In this example, your organization has a special three-day sales promotion for an upcoming holiday. Your holiday-merchandise page has undergone major changes, including dozens of new images. You want to look for performance problems with page rendering on Android mobile devices during this sales period. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Use the time picker to change the date range to the promotion period. From the performance type dropdown, select Page rendering. Select the funnel icon. From Page view attributes > Page Url, select your site's holiday-merchandise page, and then select Back to groupings list. From Browser attributes > User agent OS, select Android, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filters, select their attribute names. View comparative performance details Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with comparative performance details for the selected location. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with details for the selected location. The Page load performance tab shows two charts. The Average page load time chart includes: Average page load time for each segment of the page load timing process in seconds Request queuing information (the time after a request enters your production systems and before it reaches your application) if applicable The Average network time chart shows key elements, including how long it takes for DNS lookup, connection establishment, and secure handshake, in seconds. Tip Sometimes areas on the charts may appear to be zero or near zero. This is because some apps use existing TCP connections, and they do not need to establish new connections. The Historical performance tab shows comparison data for the selected time period, yesterday, and last week for the selected location. This includes: Average response time Throughput in pages per minute (ppm) Available metrics You can filter and group geographical performance data in New Relic Browser and in New Relic Insights. Available metrics include: Performance Metrics Webpage Page load time Throughput (pages per minute or ppm) Network time Connection time Secure connection time Network Autonomous system number and name (ASN) via IP mapping SSL negotiation timing DNS timing Time to first byte ASN latitude and longitude for Internet service providers (ISPs) To ensure end user security, New Relic Browser collects GeoIP information for the end user's ISP. New Relic Browser does not collect GeoIP information for the specific end user. For example, if an end user in Portland, Oregon uses an ISP located in Beaverton, Oregon, New Relic Browser collects the GeoIP information for the ISP in Beaverton. User agents Operating systems Browser names or types Browser versions Device types Performance and usage ranges The color-coded legend shows performance and usage as percentile ranges.

The JavaScript is included in a packet of webpage data that is sent anyway. In addition, it immediately begins monitoring for errors and events as the rest of the webpage executes. The negligible amount of overhead required to load the JavaScript results in a significant return of actionable data. Contents Overall impact The JavaScript's overhead takes into consideration both the impact on the user and the impact on your systems' performance: User perception: Typically users cannot detect performance degradations on a website of less than 200ms. Browser's JavaScript adds less than 15ms in aggregated time per page load. This is split up over time, so at no point would a user be able to perceive any performance impact due to the JavaScript. Webserver and systems: Browser App Monitoring occurs on the user's browser, not on the server. Processing time does not have an impact on your CPU consumption. In addition, we take additional steps to minimize any potential impact on the apps and webpages being monitored. For example, the \"loader\" script is loaded synchronously in the <HEAD> in order to ensure monitoring is enabled for the entire life cycle of the page. This script is included inline, which eliminates the need for another roundtrip network request to a content delivery network (CDN). The \"loader\" comes with the initial page load. Later in the life cycle of the page, New Relic loads an additional monitoring script asynchronously. This script should not have any perceivable effect to the user and is included in the overall overhead of less than 15ms per page. Network impact Browser monitoring also minimizes network traffic for the end user by aggregating data locally (in the client) and sending it back to New Relic on load, at periodic intervals, on unload, or when data has been collected. (During the browser session's idle periods, transmissions may not be required.)

      "body": "Browser monitoring provides insights into how your application or site behaves when it is loaded in a web browser. Browser only records performance data, as explained in this document. It does not record any data used or stored by the monitored application unless you explicitly configure it to do so. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Reported data Browser reports many different types of data to help you analyze your website's performance. It only reports page view data, unless you have subscribed to Pro features. You can also enable functionality for AJAX requests, JavaScript errors, and session traces. For most data types, Browser transmits the data securely using HTTPS encryption. The Browser agent transmits data to New Relic's collectors by using either of the domains bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. Here is a summary of the types of data reported by Browser monitoring. Page view data This data is reported once per page view and consists of: Page load timing data Name of the server-side app controller that served the page, if available (obfuscated in the page and during transmission) Additional custom parameters set by the server-side app controller, if available (obfuscated in the page and during transmission) Additional custom parameters set by the Browser agent API, if set prior to page load This information appears on the Page views page. For data security reasons, Browser does not record or collect URL query strings. Server-side data can only be collected when the host is also instrumented by New Relic and the browser monitoring instrumentation is injected by the agent. For more information about how we collect and present this data, see Instrumentation for page load timing. AJAX timing data When enabled, Browser periodically reports AJAX timing data until the user navigates away from or closes the page. (New Relic automatically filters out all AJAX requests that take longer than two minutes.) Data includes: Hostnames, ports, and paths (but not search/query parameters) of AJAX request URLs HTTP status code of responses Byte size of request message bodies Name of the server-side app controller servicing the AJAX request and server-side timing data (obfuscated in the page and during transmission), when the browser instrumentation is injected by the New Relic agent Timing data for the AJAX transaction Timing data for the AJAX callbacks This information appears on the AJAX page. JavaScript error data When enabled, Browser periodically reports data about every error that occurs on the page until the user navigates away from or closes the page. This information appears on the JavaScript errors page. For each error, the data includes: Exception class of the error Error message containing arbitrary text Stack trace of the error, which may contain function names and URLs of scripts causing the error Error messages typically do not contain any confidential or sensitive information. However, it is possible for messages to be purposefully constructed with sensitive information. Before enabling JavaScript error reporting, ensure that your website does not expose any sensitive information in error messages. Session trace data When enabled, Browser periodically reports data on the details of the a single page's life cycle, including user interactions, AJAX loads, and JavaScript errors, until the user navigates away from or closes the page. New Relic automatically stops recording further data after ten minutes. Data includes: Asset load timing details User interactions such as scrolling, mousing, and clicking JavaScript error timing and other JavaScript error information Triggered Javascript events Session traces are captured randomly at a fixed rate from among the monitored page views. Session trace information appears on the Session traces page. SPA data If you use Browser's single-page app (SPA) monitoring, New Relic reports the following data once per page load or route change. Browser data for page views, AJAX timing, JavaScript errors, and session traces Hash fragments associated with SPA route changes Additional custom parameters added from the SPA API When SPA monitoring has been enabled, this information appears on the Page views page. Server-side data can only be collected when the host is also instrumented by New Relic, and the Browser monitoring instrumentation is injected by the agent. For more information about how we collect and present this data, see Instrumentation for page load timing. URL query strings The Browser agent uses the HTTP referer attribute to track page URLs. URLs can sometimes contain potentially sensitive user-entered query data (for example, a user's name). For data security reasons, Browser does not record or collect URL query strings. Visitor's IP address Browser uses the visitor's IP address to enrich data for additional visitor segmentation. Details such as the ASN and geoID are mapped to Browser data from the IP address. For data security reasons, Browser does not retain the visitor's IP address for reporting. The IP address is obtained in the HTTP header from the request to the New Relic collector. New Relic does not retain the visitor's IP address after the attributes have been mapped. The IP address value is overwritten within 24 hours of data being collected. Browser types Browser determines the browser type from the User-Agent header and the geographical location based on the browser's IP address. New Relic does not retain the IP address, only the country and region associated with the performance data. This information appears on the selected app's Geography page. Also, details about specific browser types appear on the selected app's Browsers page. CDN access Page load timing requires access to the content delivery network (CDN), where New Relic's utility JavaScript file (nr.js) is hosted. The domain name for the file (js-agent.newrelic.com) remains static, but the number in the path (version) may change periodically. A script tag is injected by the New Relic agent (or pasted into the webpage for standalone apps) that references the JavaScript on the CDN, which is then loaded by the browser. The loaded JavaScript collects and reports the metrics dynamically to either of the domains bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. Important If your end users are behind a firewall or proxy and do not have access to the CDN or to New Relic's networks (including bam.nr-data.net and bam-cell.nr-data.net), Browser monitoring will not work. Cookies Browser monitoring creates cookies in the end user's browser. If the user has cookies disabled, page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) will not be able to track sessions properly. Also, if the user has an older browser that does not support the Navigation Timing Specification API, page load timing will not be able to track response times as accurately. New Relic's cookies generated by Browser agents older than version 995 may not contain the secure attribute. This is because page load timing data transmission in versions before version 995 use HTTP when the page is HTTP, but use HTTPS when the page is HTTPS. All Browser agent versions above version 995 will always use the secure flag for cookies and transmit over HTTPS. JavaScript and AJAX data may contain more sensitive information, so they are always transmitted over HTTPS. Transmission of these cookies using HTTP or access to them from JavaScript is not a significant security risk, because the cookies are not used to make security decisions or allow access to an account. They are used only to collect performance data, with any identifiable data obfuscated. For customers subject to special guidelines for cookie collection, such as those under the EU GDPR/PECR ICO Guidelines, we now provide the option to disable cookie collection for your application. Please see our Browser agent v1169 release notes for more information. Important If your site uses P3P, it must be configured to allow these cookies. JSONP requests Page load timing metrics are reported to New Relic using a Script GET, also known as a JSONP request. The Script GET returns a value that is subsequently stored in a cookie and used to trigger trace capturing.",

      "body": "New Relic Browser's Filterable Geography page provides a world view with color-coded performance information about cities, regions, and countries anywhere around the world. You can filter and drill down into detailed information, or use your mouse to select or zoom in and out of any location on the map. The enhanced attributes provide deep visibility not only about your end users' experience with page load timing, but also with network performance anywhere around the world. This level of visual detail is especially useful for professionals in IT and Operations to make business decisions about peering agreements and CDN usage. Contents Requirements Your New Relic Browser subscription level and your time picker settings determine what data you can view: Pro or higher: As of January 2016, the Filterable Geography feature automatically appears in your New Relic Browser user interface. No special setup is required. You can view up to eight days of data. Your application must be enabled to send PageView data to New Relic Insights in order to use Filterable Geography. Lite: The Filterable Geography feature appears in your New Relic Browser's UI menu but currently is not available for use. Any subscription level: If you need to use New Relic Browser's legacy Geography feature, you can still view it from your selected browser app. Factors affecting collected data To capture page load timing information, New Relic Browser uses the Navigation Timing API, which most (but not all) browsers support. If the browsers do not support the Navigation Timing API, then New Relic Browser charts and data points can only show the network data they receive for DNS lookup, connection, secure handshake, etc. This may not be 100% of the app's overall traffic. Also, firewalls may have an impact on the geographical data collected about your end users. View performance data by location one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map before drilling down into detailed information about London, England. To view or sort the performance information by location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Select the type of performance data to view from the dropdown, or use the default Average page load time. To drill down to a specific area, mouse over or select any area on the geographical map, or select any of the ten worst performing locations from the list to the right of the map. To view specific performance metrics, select any of the attributes below the funnel icon. To view comparison data, select the Page load performance or Historical performance chart below the selected location's geographical map. Use map functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions and page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the Filterable Geography page. If you want to... Do this... Change what kind of performance data appears Select your choice from the dropdown. Default performance indicator is Average page load time. The map's legend lists the ten best or worst performing areas (depending on the selected performance indicator) for the selected time period. For example: If you select Count, the map's legend shows the top ten locations with the highest number of page loads, as well as the average page load time for each. If you select Connection setup, New Relic Browser first filters out areas with low throughput. Then the map's legend shows the top ten locations where average connection time is the slowest, as well as the average page load time and count for each. View summary performance information about a specific location Mouse over any colored area on the map, select a location from the list, or zoom in and out of any area on the map. View detailed data for a location Select any area of the map. For example: If you select Canada, the map and legend show color-coded performance data for each province and territory. The list to the right of the map shows the top ten worst performing areas. If you select a specific province or territory, the map shows color-coded performance data for the top ten cities. The map includes circled locations which you can mouse over or select to view detailed information. In addition, the Page load performance and Historical performance charts below the map automatically update with each location you select. Hide the list of available attributes Select the funnel icon. Return to a larger world view Select another location on the map, or clear the filter labels above the map. Tip To return to the original map view of the world, select any area on an ocean. Examine heat map details one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map as you use filter and zoom tools to drill down into detailed information about London, England. Athough overall throughput for the area is good (green), the nearby yellow areas, and the smaller red and orange circles indicate nearby cities with varying levels of throughput problems, not the size of those cities. The Filterable Geography heat map identifies performance quality with color and with the size of circles. Heat map Description Color scale Performance quality ranges from green (the best) to yellow, orange, and then red (the worst). When selecting indicators of usage rather than performance, the heat map shows shades of purple, with the darkest shades indicating the highest usage. The color scale adapts to your app's specific performance. Each area is a percentile range. To view the range for each color segment, mouse over the heat map's legend. Thresholds Different thresholds are dynamically applied to the colors based on the type of performance indicator you select from the dropdown and the maximum value your app has reported. For example, green for Average page load time may indicate 0 to 3.3 seconds, while green for Average network time may indicate 0 to 256 milliseconds. Circles The map's colored circles help you identify areas with performance problems at a glance. Each circle's radius is based on throughput reported for the city it represents, not the size of the city itself. You may see many circles overlapping each other. This usually indicates a grouping of metropolitan areas which represent a geographic area of heavy traffic. Filter performance metrics The Filter feature allows you to select and group data by attributes in various categories, including: Page view Geography Browser Identity Custom The filtered results appear on the geographical map, where you can use any of the standard map functions to explore additional details. Here are some examples. Unsatisfactory network performance by ASN In this example, your organization is preparing to renew a peering agreement with the owner of an autonomous system, called \"My-ASN.\" You are concerned that continued outages and other connection issues are affecting customer satisfaction with your site, and you want to compare its performance with other ASNs. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. From the performance type dropdown, select Connection setup. Select the funnel icon. To view the specific ASN's performance: From the search window, type My-ASN, and then select this name from the Filter by results. OR To compare performance with other ASNs: From Geography attributes > ASN organizations, review the performance data for each organization on the list, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filter, select the attribute name. Page rendering performance during sales promotion In this example, your organization has a special three-day sales promotion for an upcoming holiday. Your holiday-merchandise page has undergone major changes, including dozens of new images. You want to look for performance problems with page rendering on Android mobile devices during this sales period. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Use the time picker to change the date range to the promotion period. From the performance type dropdown, select Page rendering. Select the funnel icon. From Page view attributes > Page Url, select your site's holiday-merchandise page, and then select Back to groupings list. From Browser attributes > User agent OS, select Android, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filters, select their attribute names. View comparative performance details Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with comparative performance details for the selected location. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with details for the selected location. The Page load performance tab shows two charts. The Average page load time chart includes: Average page load time for each segment of the page load timing process in seconds Request queuing information (the time after a request enters your production systems and before it reaches your application) if applicable The Average network time chart shows key elements, including how long it takes for DNS lookup, connection establishment, and secure handshake, in seconds. Tip Sometimes areas on the charts may appear to be zero or near zero. This is because some apps use existing TCP connections, and they do not need to establish new connections. The Historical performance tab shows comparison data for the selected time period, yesterday, and last week for the selected location. This includes: Average response time Throughput in pages per minute (ppm) Available metrics You can filter and group geographical performance data in New Relic Browser and in New Relic Insights. Available metrics include: Performance Metrics Webpage Page load time Throughput (pages per minute or ppm) Network time Connection time Secure connection time Network Autonomous system number and name (ASN) via IP mapping SSL negotiation timing DNS timing Time to first byte ASN latitude and longitude for Internet service providers (ISPs) To ensure end user security, New Relic Browser collects GeoIP information for the end user's ISP. New Relic Browser does not collect GeoIP information for the specific end user. For example, if an end user in Portland, Oregon uses an ISP located in Beaverton, Oregon, New Relic Browser collects the GeoIP information for the ISP in Beaverton. User agents Operating systems Browser names or types Browser versions Device types Performance and usage ranges The color-coded legend shows performance and usage as percentile ranges.

This JavaScript instrumentation has been designed to: Provide maximum visibility into front-end performance, accurately time how long it takes for pages to load in all browsers, and to report details for JavaScript errors and AJAX calls. Have minimal impact on overall page load time and search engine optimization (SEO), including search engine ranking, indexing, crawl efficiency, or other SEO-related concerns. Contents Efficiency of inline JavaScript The most effective method for Browser monitoring is to include a minimal amount of JavaScript instrumentation code inline in the head of the monitored page. This code then retrieves the remainder of the necessary code after the page finishes loading. Other Browser monitoring methods include JavaScript code at the end of the page body or exclusively using an external script. However, these methods can limit visibility into the end users' experience. Impact on SEO Performance testing results indicate that using Browser monitoring's JavaScript has a negligible effect on page load time. In addition, it has no negative impact on how users or search engines interact with your site. Google's consistent recommendation to website owners is to build a site that is valuable to users and accessible to search engine crawlers. Google rankings favor sites that provide the most relevant information and the best user experience. Browser monitoring can help you improve user experience by identifying performance bottlenecks, including: Slow page loads Problematic JavaScript errors Long AJAX calls Identifying Javascript errors is especially helpful because Google's bots are increasingly running the JavaScript code on websites they crawl in order to access content provided by AJAX-heavy web applications. A JavaScript error that previously was only visible to human users (for example, a broken button) could affect whether the Google bots can successfully interact with your site. We understand that SEO and traffic referred by search engines are critically important to many businesses. When used effectively, Browser monitoring can even increase a site's ranking in Google and other search engines by improving performance and user experience.

      "body": "New Relic Browser's Filterable Geography page provides a world view with color-coded performance information about cities, regions, and countries anywhere around the world. You can filter and drill down into detailed information, or use your mouse to select or zoom in and out of any location on the map. The enhanced attributes provide deep visibility not only about your end users' experience with page load timing, but also with network performance anywhere around the world. This level of visual detail is especially useful for professionals in IT and Operations to make business decisions about peering agreements and CDN usage. Contents Requirements Your New Relic Browser subscription level and your time picker settings determine what data you can view: Pro or higher: As of January 2016, the Filterable Geography feature automatically appears in your New Relic Browser user interface. No special setup is required. You can view up to eight days of data. Your application must be enabled to send PageView data to New Relic Insights in order to use Filterable Geography. Lite: The Filterable Geography feature appears in your New Relic Browser's UI menu but currently is not available for use. Any subscription level: If you need to use New Relic Browser's legacy Geography feature, you can still view it from your selected browser app. Factors affecting collected data To capture page load timing information, New Relic Browser uses the Navigation Timing API, which most (but not all) browsers support. If the browsers do not support the Navigation Timing API, then New Relic Browser charts and data points can only show the network data they receive for DNS lookup, connection, secure handshake, etc. This may not be 100% of the app's overall traffic. Also, firewalls may have an impact on the geographical data collected about your end users. View performance data by location one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map before drilling down into detailed information about London, England. To view or sort the performance information by location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Select the type of performance data to view from the dropdown, or use the default Average page load time. To drill down to a specific area, mouse over or select any area on the geographical map, or select any of the ten worst performing locations from the list to the right of the map. To view specific performance metrics, select any of the attributes below the funnel icon. To view comparison data, select the Page load performance or Historical performance chart below the selected location's geographical map. Use map functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions and page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the Filterable Geography page. If you want to... Do this... Change what kind of performance data appears Select your choice from the dropdown. Default performance indicator is Average page load time. The map's legend lists the ten best or worst performing areas (depending on the selected performance indicator) for the selected time period. For example: If you select Count, the map's legend shows the top ten locations with the highest number of page loads, as well as the average page load time for each. If you select Connection setup, New Relic Browser first filters out areas with low throughput. Then the map's legend shows the top ten locations where average connection time is the slowest, as well as the average page load time and count for each. View summary performance information about a specific location Mouse over any colored area on the map, select a location from the list, or zoom in and out of any area on the map. View detailed data for a location Select any area of the map. For example: If you select Canada, the map and legend show color-coded performance data for each province and territory. The list to the right of the map shows the top ten worst performing areas. If you select a specific province or territory, the map shows color-coded performance data for the top ten cities. The map includes circled locations which you can mouse over or select to view detailed information. In addition, the Page load performance and Historical performance charts below the map automatically update with each location you select. Hide the list of available attributes Select the funnel icon. Return to a larger world view Select another location on the map, or clear the filter labels above the map. Tip To return to the original map view of the world, select any area on an ocean. Examine heat map details one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Here is an example of the map as you use filter and zoom tools to drill down into detailed information about London, England. Athough overall throughput for the area is good (green), the nearby yellow areas, and the smaller red and orange circles indicate nearby cities with varying levels of throughput problems, not the size of those cities. The Filterable Geography heat map identifies performance quality with color and with the size of circles. Heat map Description Color scale Performance quality ranges from green (the best) to yellow, orange, and then red (the worst). When selecting indicators of usage rather than performance, the heat map shows shades of purple, with the darkest shades indicating the highest usage. The color scale adapts to your app's specific performance. Each area is a percentile range. To view the range for each color segment, mouse over the heat map's legend. Thresholds Different thresholds are dynamically applied to the colors based on the type of performance indicator you select from the dropdown and the maximum value your app has reported. For example, green for Average page load time may indicate 0 to 3.3 seconds, while green for Average network time may indicate 0 to 256 milliseconds. Circles The map's colored circles help you identify areas with performance problems at a glance. Each circle's radius is based on throughput reported for the city it represents, not the size of the city itself. You may see many circles overlapping each other. This usually indicates a grouping of metropolitan areas which represent a geographic area of heavy traffic. Filter performance metrics The Filter feature allows you to select and group data by attributes in various categories, including: Page view Geography Browser Identity Custom The filtered results appear on the geographical map, where you can use any of the standard map functions to explore additional details. Here are some examples. Unsatisfactory network performance by ASN In this example, your organization is preparing to renew a peering agreement with the owner of an autonomous system, called \"My-ASN.\" You are concerned that continued outages and other connection issues are affecting customer satisfaction with your site, and you want to compare its performance with other ASNs. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. From the performance type dropdown, select Connection setup. Select the funnel icon. To view the specific ASN's performance: From the search window, type My-ASN, and then select this name from the Filter by results. OR To compare performance with other ASNs: From Geography attributes > ASN organizations, review the performance data for each organization on the list, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filter, select the attribute name. Page rendering performance during sales promotion In this example, your organization has a special three-day sales promotion for an upcoming holiday. Your holiday-merchandise page has undergone major changes, including dozens of new images. You want to look for performance problems with page rendering on Android mobile devices during this sales period. You have a New Relic Browser Pro account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable Geography. Use the time picker to change the date range to the promotion period. From the performance type dropdown, select Page rendering. Select the funnel icon. From Page view attributes > Page Url, select your site's holiday-merchandise page, and then select Back to groupings list. From Browser attributes > User agent OS, select Android, and then select Back to groupings list. To close the filter list, select the funnel icon. Follow standard procedures to use the map functions and view comparative performance details. To clear the filters, select their attribute names. View comparative performance details Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with comparative performance details for the selected location. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Browser app > Filterable Geography: Charts on the Page load performance and Historical performance tabs automatically refresh with details for the selected location. The Page load performance tab shows two charts. The Average page load time chart includes: Average page load time for each segment of the page load timing process in seconds Request queuing information (the time after a request enters your production systems and before it reaches your application) if applicable The Average network time chart shows key elements, including how long it takes for DNS lookup, connection establishment, and secure handshake, in seconds. Tip Sometimes areas on the charts may appear to be zero or near zero. This is because some apps use existing TCP connections, and they do not need to establish new connections. The Historical performance tab shows comparison data for the selected time period, yesterday, and last week for the selected location. This includes: Average response time Throughput in pages per minute (ppm) Available metrics You can filter and group geographical performance data in New Relic Browser and in New Relic Insights. Available metrics include: Performance Metrics Webpage Page load time Throughput (pages per minute or ppm) Network time Connection time Secure connection time Network Autonomous system number and name (ASN) via IP mapping SSL negotiation timing DNS timing Time to first byte ASN latitude and longitude for Internet service providers (ISPs) To ensure end user security, New Relic Browser collects GeoIP information for the end user's ISP. New Relic Browser does not collect GeoIP information for the specific end user. For example, if an end user in Portland, Oregon uses an ISP located in Beaverton, Oregon, New Relic Browser collects the GeoIP information for the ISP in Beaverton. User agents Operating systems Browser names or types Browser versions Device types Performance and usage ranges The color-coded legend shows performance and usage as percentile ranges.

      "body": "Running the latest version of Browser monitoring ensures you can access all Browser features and enhancements. To update to the latest version, check your version number, then follow the steps to update an APM-managed installation or to upgrade a copy/paste installation. Check your version number To verify your Browser version number: View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet. Search the page source for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-. The numbers that follow nr- are your current version. For example, js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js indicates you are running version 593 of the Browser script. The Pro+SPA agent will have the format js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1184.min.js To verify the latest version of the Browser script loader: Go to js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js . Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your Browser agent. Check deployment method Your Browser agent may have been deployed using the copy/paste method rather than injected with APM. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your Browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed Browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the Browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific Browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your Browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, use the Browser Pro + SPA endpoint, the Browser Pro endpoint, or the Browser Lite endpoint. These endpoints always point to the latest version of the script snippet. Recommendation: Use the Browser Pro or Pro + SPA loaders regardless of your Browser subscription level. These loaders are compatible with both the Pro and Lite subscription levels. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your Browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your Browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

      "body": "Problem If you have just configured your application with browser monitoring, wait a few minutes for data to appear. If you have already waited a few minutes and you still do not see any data, try these troubleshooting tips. Some of these tips depend on whether you deployed your app by allowing browser monitoring to automatically insert the JavaScript snippet into your APM-monitored app or by inserting the JavaScript snippet yourself. Tip To use APM and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Solution Recommendation: Before following specific troubleshooting procedures, run the Diagnostics browser checks. Once Diagnostics CLI is downloaded, target the Browser checks by running the command-line options: /nrdiag -browser-url YOUR-WEBSITE-URL -suites browser. The information returned from Diagnostics CLI can be used when communicating with New Relic Support. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed for an account monitored with an APM agent, see APM deployments. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed using the JavaScript copy/paste method, see Copy/paste deployment. If you are unsure which you have, the Diagnostics tool will return the deployment method. You can also troubleshoot situations where you are missing only AJAX or session trace data. Deployment via APM agent These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when the browser monitoring agent is installed on an app already being monitored by an APM agent: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Update your APM agent More recent APM agents place the page load timing scripts more accurately. Before continuing with these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the most recent release for your APM agent. Tip For agent version requirements for page load timing, see Compatibility and requirements. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the two script elements required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (window.NREUM||(NREUM={})).loader_config={xpid:\"VRUGVVJS\";window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a(b,c,d){ ... Copy OR like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy Also verify that a second script element exists in one of two locations, depending on the app server agent language. C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java: Before the </body> tag (which must be added to the page if missing) .NET: Immediately before the first script element Node.js: Immediately before the first script element PHP: At the end of the body element Python: In the head element or at the end of the body element Ruby: Immediately before the first script element The second tag contains configuration and timing data, and looks like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy If either script element is missing, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the Browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The configuration options explained below refer only to the browser agent, and should not to be confused with the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your agent: Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available.

      "body": "Running the latest version of Browser monitoring ensures you can access all Browser features and enhancements. To update to the latest version, check your version number, then follow the steps to update an APM-managed installation or to upgrade a copy/paste installation. Check your version number To verify your Browser version number: View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet. Search the page source for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-. The numbers that follow nr- are your current version. For example, js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js indicates you are running version 593 of the Browser script. The Pro+SPA agent will have the format js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1184.min.js To verify the latest version of the Browser script loader: Go to js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js . Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your Browser agent. Check deployment method Your Browser agent may have been deployed using the copy/paste method rather than injected with APM. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your Browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed Browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the Browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific Browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your Browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, use the Browser Pro + SPA endpoint, the Browser Pro endpoint, or the Browser Lite endpoint. These endpoints always point to the latest version of the script snippet. Recommendation: Use the Browser Pro or Pro + SPA loaders regardless of your Browser subscription level. These loaders are compatible with both the Pro and Lite subscription levels. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your Browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your Browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

If you have already waited a few minutes and you still do not see any data, try these troubleshooting tips. Some of these tips depend on whether you deployed your app by allowing browser monitoring to automatically insert the JavaScript snippet into your APM-monitored app or by inserting the JavaScript snippet yourself. Tip To use APM and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Solution Recommendation: Before following specific troubleshooting procedures, run the Diagnostics browser checks. Once Diagnostics CLI is downloaded, target the Browser checks by running the command-line options: /nrdiag -browser-url YOUR-WEBSITE-URL -suites browser. The information returned from Diagnostics CLI can be used when communicating with New Relic Support. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed for an account monitored with an APM agent, see APM deployments. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed using the JavaScript copy/paste method, see Copy/paste deployment. If you are unsure which you have, the Diagnostics tool will return the deployment method. You can also troubleshoot situations where you are missing only AJAX or session trace data. Deployment via APM agent These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when the browser monitoring agent is installed on an app already being monitored by an APM agent: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Update your APM agent More recent APM agents place the page load timing scripts more accurately. Before continuing with these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the most recent release for your APM agent. Tip For agent version requirements for page load timing, see Compatibility and requirements. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the two script elements required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (window.NREUM||(NREUM={})).loader_config={xpid:\"VRUGVVJS\";window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a(b,c,d){ ... Copy OR like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy Also verify that a second script element exists in one of two locations, depending on the app server agent language. C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java: Before the </body> tag (which must be added to the page if missing) .NET: Immediately before the first script element Node.js: Immediately before the first script element PHP: At the end of the body element Python: In the head element or at the end of the body element Ruby: Immediately before the first script element The second tag contains configuration and timing data, and looks like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy If either script element is missing, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the Browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The configuration options explained below refer only to the browser agent, and should not to be confused with the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your agent: Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available.

      "body": "Running the latest version of Browser monitoring ensures you can access all Browser features and enhancements. To update to the latest version, check your version number, then follow the steps to update an APM-managed installation or to upgrade a copy/paste installation. Check your version number To verify your Browser version number: View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet. Search the page source for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-. The numbers that follow nr- are your current version. For example, js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js indicates you are running version 593 of the Browser script. The Pro+SPA agent will have the format js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1184.min.js To verify the latest version of the Browser script loader: Go to js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js . Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your Browser agent. Check deployment method Your Browser agent may have been deployed using the copy/paste method rather than injected with APM. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your Browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed Browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the Browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific Browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your Browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, use the Browser Pro + SPA endpoint, the Browser Pro endpoint, or the Browser Lite endpoint. These endpoints always point to the latest version of the script snippet. Recommendation: Use the Browser Pro or Pro + SPA loaders regardless of your Browser subscription level. These loaders are compatible with both the Pro and Lite subscription levels. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your Browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your Browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

Tip To use APM and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Solution Recommendation: Before following specific troubleshooting procedures, run the Diagnostics browser checks. Once Diagnostics CLI is downloaded, target the Browser checks by running the command-line options: /nrdiag -browser-url YOUR-WEBSITE-URL -suites browser. The information returned from Diagnostics CLI can be used when communicating with New Relic Support. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed for an account monitored with an APM agent, see APM deployments. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed using the JavaScript copy/paste method, see Copy/paste deployment. If you are unsure which you have, the Diagnostics tool will return the deployment method. You can also troubleshoot situations where you are missing only AJAX or session trace data. Deployment via APM agent These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when the browser monitoring agent is installed on an app already being monitored by an APM agent: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Update your APM agent More recent APM agents place the page load timing scripts more accurately. Before continuing with these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the most recent release for your APM agent. Tip For agent version requirements for page load timing, see Compatibility and requirements. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the two script elements required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (window.NREUM||(NREUM={})).loader_config={xpid:\"VRUGVVJS\";window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a(b,c,d){ ... Copy OR like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy Also verify that a second script element exists in one of two locations, depending on the app server agent language. C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java: Before the </body> tag (which must be added to the page if missing) .NET: Immediately before the first script element Node.js: Immediately before the first script element PHP: At the end of the body element Python: In the head element or at the end of the body element Ruby: Immediately before the first script element The second tag contains configuration and timing data, and looks like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy If either script element is missing, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the Browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The configuration options explained below refer only to the browser agent, and should not to be confused with the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your agent: Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available.

      "body": "Running the latest version of Browser monitoring ensures you can access all Browser features and enhancements. To update to the latest version, check your version number, then follow the steps to update an APM-managed installation or to upgrade a copy/paste installation. Check your version number To verify your Browser version number: View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet. Search the page source for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-. The numbers that follow nr- are your current version. For example, js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js indicates you are running version 593 of the Browser script. The Pro+SPA agent will have the format js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1184.min.js To verify the latest version of the Browser script loader: Go to js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js . Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your Browser agent. Check deployment method Your Browser agent may have been deployed using the copy/paste method rather than injected with APM. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your Browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed Browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the Browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific Browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your Browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, use the Browser Pro + SPA endpoint, the Browser Pro endpoint, or the Browser Lite endpoint. These endpoints always point to the latest version of the script snippet. Recommendation: Use the Browser Pro or Pro + SPA loaders regardless of your Browser subscription level. These loaders are compatible with both the Pro and Lite subscription levels. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your Browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your Browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

      "body": "Problem If you have just configured your application with browser monitoring, wait a few minutes for data to appear. If you have already waited a few minutes and you still do not see any data, try these troubleshooting tips. Some of these tips depend on whether you deployed your app by allowing browser monitoring to automatically insert the JavaScript snippet into your APM-monitored app or by inserting the JavaScript snippet yourself. Tip To use APM and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Solution Recommendation: Before following specific troubleshooting procedures, run the Diagnostics browser checks. Once Diagnostics CLI is downloaded, target the Browser checks by running the command-line options: /nrdiag -browser-url YOUR-WEBSITE-URL -suites browser. The information returned from Diagnostics CLI can be used when communicating with New Relic Support. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed for an account monitored with an APM agent, see APM deployments. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed using the JavaScript copy/paste method, see Copy/paste deployment. If you are unsure which you have, the Diagnostics tool will return the deployment method. You can also troubleshoot situations where you are missing only AJAX or session trace data. Deployment via APM agent These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when the browser monitoring agent is installed on an app already being monitored by an APM agent: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Update your APM agent More recent APM agents place the page load timing scripts more accurately. Before continuing with these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the most recent release for your APM agent. Tip For agent version requirements for page load timing, see Compatibility and requirements. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the two script elements required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (window.NREUM||(NREUM={})).loader_config={xpid:\"VRUGVVJS\";window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a(b,c,d){ ... Copy OR like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy Also verify that a second script element exists in one of two locations, depending on the app server agent language. C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java: Before the </body> tag (which must be added to the page if missing) .NET: Immediately before the first script element Node.js: Immediately before the first script element PHP: At the end of the body element Python: In the head element or at the end of the body element Ruby: Immediately before the first script element The second tag contains configuration and timing data, and looks like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy If either script element is missing, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the Browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing.

      "body": "Running the latest version of Browser monitoring ensures you can access all Browser features and enhancements. To update to the latest version, check your version number, then follow the steps to update an APM-managed installation or to upgrade a copy/paste installation. Check your version number To verify your Browser version number: View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet. Search the page source for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-. The numbers that follow nr- are your current version. For example, js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js indicates you are running version 593 of the Browser script. The Pro+SPA agent will have the format js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1184.min.js To verify the latest version of the Browser script loader: Go to js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js . Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your Browser agent. Check deployment method Your Browser agent may have been deployed using the copy/paste method rather than injected with APM. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your Browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed Browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the Browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific Browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your Browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, use the Browser Pro + SPA endpoint, the Browser Pro endpoint, or the Browser Lite endpoint. These endpoints always point to the latest version of the script snippet. Recommendation: Use the Browser Pro or Pro + SPA loaders regardless of your Browser subscription level. These loaders are compatible with both the Pro and Lite subscription levels. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your Browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your Browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

      "body": "Problem If you have just configured your application with browser monitoring, wait a few minutes for data to appear. If you have already waited a few minutes and you still do not see any data, try these troubleshooting tips. Some of these tips depend on whether you deployed your app by allowing browser monitoring to automatically insert the JavaScript snippet into your APM-monitored app or by inserting the JavaScript snippet yourself. Tip To use APM and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Solution Recommendation: Before following specific troubleshooting procedures, run the Diagnostics browser checks. Once Diagnostics CLI is downloaded, target the Browser checks by running the command-line options: /nrdiag -browser-url YOUR-WEBSITE-URL -suites browser. The information returned from Diagnostics CLI can be used when communicating with New Relic Support. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed for an account monitored with an APM agent, see APM deployments. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed using the JavaScript copy/paste method, see Copy/paste deployment. If you are unsure which you have, the Diagnostics tool will return the deployment method. You can also troubleshoot situations where you are missing only AJAX or session trace data. Deployment via APM agent These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when the browser monitoring agent is installed on an app already being monitored by an APM agent: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Update your APM agent More recent APM agents place the page load timing scripts more accurately. Before continuing with these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the most recent release for your APM agent. Tip For agent version requirements for page load timing, see Compatibility and requirements. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the two script elements required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (window.NREUM||(NREUM={})).loader_config={xpid:\"VRUGVVJS\";window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a(b,c,d){ ... Copy OR like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy Also verify that a second script element exists in one of two locations, depending on the app server agent language. C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java: Before the </body> tag (which must be added to the page if missing) .NET: Immediately before the first script element Node.js: Immediately before the first script element PHP: At the end of the body element Python: In the head element or at the end of the body element Ruby: Immediately before the first script element The second tag contains configuration and timing data, and looks like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy If either script element is missing, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the Browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The configuration options explained below refer only to the browser agent, and should not to be confused with the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors.

To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your Browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed Browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the Browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific Browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your Browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, use the Browser Pro + SPA endpoint, the Browser Pro endpoint, or the Browser Lite endpoint. These endpoints always point to the latest version of the script snippet. Recommendation: Use the Browser Pro or Pro + SPA loaders regardless of your Browser subscription level. These loaders are compatible with both the Pro and Lite subscription levels. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your Browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your Browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

      "body": "Problem If you have just configured your application with browser monitoring, wait a few minutes for data to appear. If you have already waited a few minutes and you still do not see any data, try these troubleshooting tips. Some of these tips depend on whether you deployed your app by allowing browser monitoring to automatically insert the JavaScript snippet into your APM-monitored app or by inserting the JavaScript snippet yourself. Tip To use APM and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Solution Recommendation: Before following specific troubleshooting procedures, run the Diagnostics browser checks. Once Diagnostics CLI is downloaded, target the Browser checks by running the command-line options: /nrdiag -browser-url YOUR-WEBSITE-URL -suites browser. The information returned from Diagnostics CLI can be used when communicating with New Relic Support. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed for an account monitored with an APM agent, see APM deployments. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed using the JavaScript copy/paste method, see Copy/paste deployment. If you are unsure which you have, the Diagnostics tool will return the deployment method. You can also troubleshoot situations where you are missing only AJAX or session trace data. Deployment via APM agent These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when the browser monitoring agent is installed on an app already being monitored by an APM agent: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Update your APM agent More recent APM agents place the page load timing scripts more accurately. Before continuing with these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the most recent release for your APM agent. Tip For agent version requirements for page load timing, see Compatibility and requirements. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the two script elements required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (window.NREUM||(NREUM={})).loader_config={xpid:\"VRUGVVJS\";window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a(b,c,d){ ... Copy OR like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy Also verify that a second script element exists in one of two locations, depending on the app server agent language. C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java: Before the </body> tag (which must be added to the page if missing) .NET: Immediately before the first script element Node.js: Immediately before the first script element PHP: At the end of the body element Python: In the head element or at the end of the body element Ruby: Immediately before the first script element The second tag contains configuration and timing data, and looks like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy If either script element is missing, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the Browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The configuration options explained below refer only to the browser agent, and should not to be confused with the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your agent: Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available.

Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your Browser agent. Check deployment method Your Browser agent may have been deployed using the copy/paste method rather than injected with APM.

      "body": "Problem If you have just configured your application with browser monitoring, wait a few minutes for data to appear. If you have already waited a few minutes and you still do not see any data, try these troubleshooting tips. Some of these tips depend on whether you deployed your app by allowing browser monitoring to automatically insert the JavaScript snippet into your APM-monitored app or by inserting the JavaScript snippet yourself. Tip To use APM and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Solution Recommendation: Before following specific troubleshooting procedures, run the Diagnostics browser checks. Once Diagnostics CLI is downloaded, target the Browser checks by running the command-line options: /nrdiag -browser-url YOUR-WEBSITE-URL -suites browser. The information returned from Diagnostics CLI can be used when communicating with New Relic Support. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed for an account monitored with an APM agent, see APM deployments. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed using the JavaScript copy/paste method, see Copy/paste deployment. If you are unsure which you have, the Diagnostics tool will return the deployment method. You can also troubleshoot situations where you are missing only AJAX or session trace data. Deployment via APM agent These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when the browser monitoring agent is installed on an app already being monitored by an APM agent: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Update your APM agent More recent APM agents place the page load timing scripts more accurately. Before continuing with these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the most recent release for your APM agent. Tip For agent version requirements for page load timing, see Compatibility and requirements. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the two script elements required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (window.NREUM||(NREUM={})).loader_config={xpid:\"VRUGVVJS\";window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a(b,c,d){ ... Copy OR like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy Also verify that a second script element exists in one of two locations, depending on the app server agent language. C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java: Before the </body> tag (which must be added to the page if missing) .NET: Immediately before the first script element Node.js: Immediately before the first script element PHP: At the end of the body element Python: In the head element or at the end of the body element Ruby: Immediately before the first script element The second tag contains configuration and timing data, and looks like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy If either script element is missing, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the Browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The configuration options explained below refer only to the browser agent, and should not to be confused with the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your agent: Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available.

      "body": "Running the latest version of Browser monitoring ensures you can access all Browser features and enhancements. To update to the latest version, check your version number, then follow the steps to update an APM-managed installation or to upgrade a copy/paste installation. Check your version number To verify your Browser version number: View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet. Search the page source for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-. The numbers that follow nr- are your current version. For example, js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js indicates you are running version 593 of the Browser script. The Pro+SPA agent will have the format js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1184.min.js To verify the latest version of the Browser script loader: Go to js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js . Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your Browser agent. Check deployment method Your Browser agent may have been deployed using the copy/paste method rather than injected with APM. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your Browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed Browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the Browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific Browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your Browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, use the Browser Pro + SPA endpoint, the Browser Pro endpoint, or the Browser Lite endpoint. These endpoints always point to the latest version of the script snippet. Recommendation: Use the Browser Pro or Pro + SPA loaders regardless of your Browser subscription level. These loaders are compatible with both the Pro and Lite subscription levels. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your Browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your Browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the Browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The configuration options explained below refer only to the browser agent, and should not to be confused with the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your agent: Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available.

      "body": "Running the latest version of Browser monitoring ensures you can access all Browser features and enhancements. To update to the latest version, check your version number, then follow the steps to update an APM-managed installation or to upgrade a copy/paste installation. Check your version number To verify your Browser version number: View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet. Search the page source for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-. The numbers that follow nr- are your current version. For example, js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js indicates you are running version 593 of the Browser script. The Pro+SPA agent will have the format js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1184.min.js To verify the latest version of the Browser script loader: Go to js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js . Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your Browser agent. Check deployment method Your Browser agent may have been deployed using the copy/paste method rather than injected with APM. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your Browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed Browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the Browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific Browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your Browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, use the Browser Pro + SPA endpoint, the Browser Pro endpoint, or the Browser Lite endpoint. These endpoints always point to the latest version of the script snippet. Recommendation: Use the Browser Pro or Pro + SPA loaders regardless of your Browser subscription level. These loaders are compatible with both the Pro and Lite subscription levels. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your Browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your Browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

Once Diagnostics CLI is downloaded, target the Browser checks by running the command-line options: /nrdiag -browser-url YOUR-WEBSITE-URL -suites browser. The information returned from Diagnostics CLI can be used when communicating with New Relic Support. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed for an account monitored with an APM agent, see APM deployments. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed using the JavaScript copy/paste method, see Copy/paste deployment. If you are unsure which you have, the Diagnostics tool will return the deployment method. You can also troubleshoot situations where you are missing only AJAX or session trace data. Deployment via APM agent These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when the browser monitoring agent is installed on an app already being monitored by an APM agent: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Update your APM agent More recent APM agents place the page load timing scripts more accurately. Before continuing with these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the most recent release for your APM agent. Tip For agent version requirements for page load timing, see Compatibility and requirements. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the two script elements required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (window.NREUM||(NREUM={})).loader_config={xpid:\"VRUGVVJS\";window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a(b,c,d){ ... Copy OR like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy Also verify that a second script element exists in one of two locations, depending on the app server agent language. C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java: Before the </body> tag (which must be added to the page if missing) .NET: Immediately before the first script element Node.js: Immediately before the first script element PHP: At the end of the body element Python: In the head element or at the end of the body element Ruby: Immediately before the first script element The second tag contains configuration and timing data, and looks like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy If either script element is missing, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the Browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The configuration options explained below refer only to the browser agent, and should not to be confused with the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your agent: Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available.

      "body": "Running the latest version of Browser monitoring ensures you can access all Browser features and enhancements. To update to the latest version, check your version number, then follow the steps to update an APM-managed installation or to upgrade a copy/paste installation. Check your version number To verify your Browser version number: View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet. Search the page source for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-. The numbers that follow nr- are your current version. For example, js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js indicates you are running version 593 of the Browser script. The Pro+SPA agent will have the format js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1184.min.js To verify the latest version of the Browser script loader: Go to js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js . Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your Browser agent. Check deployment method Your Browser agent may have been deployed using the copy/paste method rather than injected with APM. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your Browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed Browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the Browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific Browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your Browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, use the Browser Pro + SPA endpoint, the Browser Pro endpoint, or the Browser Lite endpoint. These endpoints always point to the latest version of the script snippet. Recommendation: Use the Browser Pro or Pro + SPA loaders regardless of your Browser subscription level. These loaders are compatible with both the Pro and Lite subscription levels. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your Browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your Browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

If you have already waited a few minutes and you still do not see any data, try these troubleshooting tips. Some of these tips depend on whether you deployed your app by allowing browser monitoring to automatically insert the JavaScript snippet into your APM-monitored app or by inserting the JavaScript snippet yourself. Tip To use APM and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Solution Recommendation: Before following specific troubleshooting procedures, run the Diagnostics browser checks. Once Diagnostics CLI is downloaded, target the Browser checks by running the command-line options: /nrdiag -browser-url YOUR-WEBSITE-URL -suites browser. The information returned from Diagnostics CLI can be used when communicating with New Relic Support. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed for an account monitored with an APM agent, see APM deployments. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed using the JavaScript copy/paste method, see Copy/paste deployment. If you are unsure which you have, the Diagnostics tool will return the deployment method. You can also troubleshoot situations where you are missing only AJAX or session trace data. Deployment via APM agent These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when the browser monitoring agent is installed on an app already being monitored by an APM agent: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Update your APM agent More recent APM agents place the page load timing scripts more accurately. Before continuing with these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the most recent release for your APM agent. Tip For agent version requirements for page load timing, see Compatibility and requirements. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the two script elements required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (window.NREUM||(NREUM={})).loader_config={xpid:\"VRUGVVJS\";window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a(b,c,d){ ... Copy OR like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy Also verify that a second script element exists in one of two locations, depending on the app server agent language. C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java: Before the </body> tag (which must be added to the page if missing) .NET: Immediately before the first script element Node.js: Immediately before the first script element PHP: At the end of the body element Python: In the head element or at the end of the body element Ruby: Immediately before the first script element The second tag contains configuration and timing data, and looks like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy If either script element is missing, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the Browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your agent: Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available.

      "body": "Running the latest version of Browser monitoring ensures you can access all Browser features and enhancements. To update to the latest version, check your version number, then follow the steps to update an APM-managed installation or to upgrade a copy/paste installation. Check your version number To verify your Browser version number: View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet. Search the page source for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-. The numbers that follow nr- are your current version. For example, js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js indicates you are running version 593 of the Browser script. The Pro+SPA agent will have the format js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1184.min.js To verify the latest version of the Browser script loader: Go to js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js . Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your Browser agent. Check deployment method Your Browser agent may have been deployed using the copy/paste method rather than injected with APM. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your Browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed Browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the Browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific Browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your Browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, use the Browser Pro + SPA endpoint, the Browser Pro endpoint, or the Browser Lite endpoint. These endpoints always point to the latest version of the script snippet. Recommendation: Use the Browser Pro or Pro + SPA loaders regardless of your Browser subscription level. These loaders are compatible with both the Pro and Lite subscription levels. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your Browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your Browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

      "body": "Problem If you have just configured your application with browser monitoring, wait a few minutes for data to appear. If you have already waited a few minutes and you still do not see any data, try these troubleshooting tips. Some of these tips depend on whether you deployed your app by allowing browser monitoring to automatically insert the JavaScript snippet into your APM-monitored app or by inserting the JavaScript snippet yourself. Tip To use APM and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Solution Recommendation: Before following specific troubleshooting procedures, run the Diagnostics browser checks. Once Diagnostics CLI is downloaded, target the Browser checks by running the command-line options: /nrdiag -browser-url YOUR-WEBSITE-URL -suites browser. The information returned from Diagnostics CLI can be used when communicating with New Relic Support. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed for an account monitored with an APM agent, see APM deployments. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed using the JavaScript copy/paste method, see Copy/paste deployment. If you are unsure which you have, the Diagnostics tool will return the deployment method. You can also troubleshoot situations where you are missing only AJAX or session trace data. Deployment via APM agent These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when the browser monitoring agent is installed on an app already being monitored by an APM agent: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Update your APM agent More recent APM agents place the page load timing scripts more accurately. Before continuing with these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the most recent release for your APM agent. Tip For agent version requirements for page load timing, see Compatibility and requirements. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the two script elements required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (window.NREUM||(NREUM={})).loader_config={xpid:\"VRUGVVJS\";window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a(b,c,d){ ... Copy OR like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy Also verify that a second script element exists in one of two locations, depending on the app server agent language. C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java: Before the </body> tag (which must be added to the page if missing) .NET: Immediately before the first script element Node.js: Immediately before the first script element PHP: At the end of the body element Python: In the head element or at the end of the body element Ruby: Immediately before the first script element The second tag contains configuration and timing data, and looks like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy If either script element is missing, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the Browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The configuration options explained below refer only to the browser agent, and should not to be confused with the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible.

      "body": "Running the latest version of Browser monitoring ensures you can access all Browser features and enhancements. To update to the latest version, check your version number, then follow the steps to update an APM-managed installation or to upgrade a copy/paste installation. Check your version number To verify your Browser version number: View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet. Search the page source for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-. The numbers that follow nr- are your current version. For example, js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js indicates you are running version 593 of the Browser script. The Pro+SPA agent will have the format js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1184.min.js To verify the latest version of the Browser script loader: Go to js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js . Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your Browser agent. Check deployment method Your Browser agent may have been deployed using the copy/paste method rather than injected with APM. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your Browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed Browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the Browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific Browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your Browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, use the Browser Pro + SPA endpoint, the Browser Pro endpoint, or the Browser Lite endpoint. These endpoints always point to the latest version of the script snippet. Recommendation: Use the Browser Pro or Pro + SPA loaders regardless of your Browser subscription level. These loaders are compatible with both the Pro and Lite subscription levels. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your Browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your Browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

      "body": "Problem If you have just configured your application with browser monitoring, wait a few minutes for data to appear. If you have already waited a few minutes and you still do not see any data, try these troubleshooting tips. Some of these tips depend on whether you deployed your app by allowing browser monitoring to automatically insert the JavaScript snippet into your APM-monitored app or by inserting the JavaScript snippet yourself. Tip To use APM and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Solution Recommendation: Before following specific troubleshooting procedures, run the Diagnostics browser checks. Once Diagnostics CLI is downloaded, target the Browser checks by running the command-line options: /nrdiag -browser-url YOUR-WEBSITE-URL -suites browser. The information returned from Diagnostics CLI can be used when communicating with New Relic Support. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed for an account monitored with an APM agent, see APM deployments. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed using the JavaScript copy/paste method, see Copy/paste deployment. If you are unsure which you have, the Diagnostics tool will return the deployment method. You can also troubleshoot situations where you are missing only AJAX or session trace data. Deployment via APM agent These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when the browser monitoring agent is installed on an app already being monitored by an APM agent: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Update your APM agent More recent APM agents place the page load timing scripts more accurately. Before continuing with these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the most recent release for your APM agent. Tip For agent version requirements for page load timing, see Compatibility and requirements. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the two script elements required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (window.NREUM||(NREUM={})).loader_config={xpid:\"VRUGVVJS\";window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a(b,c,d){ ... Copy OR like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy Also verify that a second script element exists in one of two locations, depending on the app server agent language. C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java: Before the </body> tag (which must be added to the page if missing) .NET: Immediately before the first script element Node.js: Immediately before the first script element PHP: At the end of the body element Python: In the head element or at the end of the body element Ruby: Immediately before the first script element The second tag contains configuration and timing data, and looks like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy If either script element is missing, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the Browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The configuration options explained below refer only to the browser agent, and should not to be confused with the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your agent: Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available.

      "body": "Single page applications (SPAs) are web applications that load a single HTML page. The app dynamically updates without requiring a full page reload, in response to user interactions with the app, such as clicking a button or submitting a request. Browser's SPA monitoring provides deeper visibility and actionable insights into real users' experiences with single-page apps. SPA monitoring is also valuable for any app that uses AJAX requests to pull content dynamically and create a fluid user experience. In addition to monitoring route changes automatically, you can use Browser monitoring's SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. This allows developers and their team to: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query your data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Enable SPA monitoring Before installing SPA monitoring, read SPA compatibility and requirements. Then, see Add apps to Single Page App monitoring. Analyze throughput and performance data Improving on traditional industry standards for measuring page load timing, we give you a complete picture of the activity, both synchronous and asynchronous, associated with page loads and route changes. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views: Use Browser monitoring's SPA monitoring to examine the throughput and performance of your SPA-architecture app. SPA data monitored by Browser monitoring can include: Performance data and throughput for page loads and route changes AJAX request data JavaScript activity, both synchronous and asynchronous Dynamic page updates, monitored using the SPA API With this data, you will gain a clear understanding of how your users experience your app's page loads and route changes, and be able to solve bottlenecks and troubleshoot errors. For more about how New Relic handles SPA data, see Understand SPA data collection. Browser SPA features Here is a summary of SPA monitoring features: Single-page app monitoring Take advantage of these features Robust views in Browser's UI When a user initiates a page load or route change, New Relic begins to monitor all subsequent JavaScript, and ends the timing once all AJAX events are complete. This provides a more accurate view of when a page is actually ready for a user compared to the traditional method of ending the timing when the window load event is fired. When SPA monitoring is enabled, the Page views page in Browser shows event-driven data about application usage levels (throughput) and user experience (performance), including: Charts with drill-down details about initial page load performance, route changes, and historical performance Sort, search, and filter options, including custom attributes Additional AJAX breakdown data for all initial page loads and route changes For an explanation of how SPA monitoring will impact your existing Browser account's data usage, see SPA and Browser data usage. Data analysis with data explorer The data explorer supports three SPA-specific event types: BrowserInteraction, AjaxRequest, and BrowserTiming. You can query these events in the query builder to analyze your app's performance and make business decisions. Customized data from API Use SPA API to obtain the specific data you need, such as custom naming, custom timing, finishline API, or other custom attributes.

      "body": "Problem You are using the Browser Pro + SPA agent, but you are not seeing all of the route change browser interactions you expect. We are aware that this can be frustrating. Our goal in summer 2020 is to reevaluate the SPA feature functionality, making it simpler and more reliable, starting with the methods we use to detect and capture route changes. Additionally, we plan to add new frameworks and use cases to our testing suite based on your feedback and examples. Likely this work will include new APIs as well as framework-specific plug-ins. Check our release notes for the latest updates. Solution Short term solutions To make sure all route changes are captured, you can use our SPA interaction() API. Using the interaction API will categorize the BrowserInteraction event (in the category attribute) as custom rather than a route change if no route change is in fact detected. If your framework is exposing events that represent router activity, you can use custom instrumentation in these events. Here is an example using our API with the Angular router: router.events.subscribe( (event: Event) => { if (event instanceof NavigationStart) { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(event.url) i.save() } }); Copy In this example, the router object is an instance of the Angular router (from the @angular/router module). The setName call sets the name attribute of the BrowserInteraction event to the new URL, and the save call ensures that the interaction is captured. You will need to adapt this for the needs of your own application’s framework. If your framework does not provide routing events, then you can add this code in the event handler of the original interaction event such as click): myButton.addEventListener('click', function () { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(‘new URL') i.save() }); Copy Recommendation: If you do not have access to router events nor the interaction event handler, implement this as soon as possible in code that you know is the result of a user interaction. An alternative to using the SPA API is to capture routes as PageAction events. PageAction events can be used to capture any custom data. We recommend this option as a fallback in case using the SPA interaction API does not work as expected, or to completely separate the custom instrumentation from built-in BrowserInteraction events. Both of these solutions can ensure these events are captured, either as a BrowserInteraction event or as a PageAction event. However, they will not address recording the correct duration and related AJAX calls. Support If this solution does not resolve your issue, please file a support ticket, and have the following information available: For situations where you are seeing most route changes, but none for a particular route change you expect, attempt to evaluate the difference in the implementation of the code for that particular route. Is there something non-standard or unique about that route that you could provide to our support team? Document the frameworks and any libraries that might be of interest. If this is a new problem, has anything changed in your environment that has led to these interactions suddenly not being tracked? Note the Browser agent version you are using. If you are more than a few releases behind, we will recommend that you update to the latest release, as we may have already resolved a similar issue. Be aware that due to the complexity of diagnosing these issues, the team will likely need access to an environment and code that demonstrates the problem for testing and research. Cause The Browser product attempts to be framework agnostic, as well as support coding best practices. However, there are often edge cases that will be missed that lead to you not collecting the route changes you expect. The implementation is based on instrumenting most common asynchronous browser APIs. There are cases when a web application uses some asynchronous API or uses custom or third-party code that we do not instrument, and this can result in inaccurate or missed route changes.",

To check your version and integrate the updated snippet, follow the appropriate upgrade instructions. Browser types SPA monitoring requires the addEventListener Browser API and the Navigation Timing API. Both APIs are available in all modern browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher.

Tip To use SPA and browser monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Prerequisites In order to deploy SPA monitoring, you must: Make sure your app and Browser agent version meet New Relic's compatibility and requirements. Agree to the Terms of Service, which automatically appears during the setup process for the first app you select for your account. By agreeing to the Terms, you authorize New Relic to collect hash fragments from URLs. You only need to select the checkbox option once for your account. Enable SPA monitoring To deploy SPA monitoring for your app, you must already have a Pro subscription. Then, you must enable Pro + SPA monitoring, and deploy a new JavaScript snippet that includes SPA monitoring. Tip The bottom of the generated JavaScript snippet includes your Browser license key and application ID. This is useful, for example, when using the New Relic REST API (v2) or API Explorer. To enable SPA monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings, then select Pro + SPA. Agree to the Terms of Service. Select Save application settings. Deploy the new JavaScript snippet using the same method you used when you originally deployed Browser for your app: If you deploy Browser with the copy/paste method: Copy the entire JavaScript code snippet. Paste it as close to the top of the HEAD of your webpage as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). If you deploy using an APM agent: If possible, restart your app and clear the server-side cache to ensure the APM agent picks up the change and deploys the new JavaScript snippet. Generate some traffic, then wait a few minutes for Browser to start receiving SPA monitoring data. To view SPA data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. If SPA data does not start to appear in the Page views page after a few minutes, see Browser's troubleshooting procedures. Disable SPA monitoring To opt out of our SPA monitoring feature: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Select a different agent version/loader option.
