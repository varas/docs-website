To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account.

To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account.

Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration.

If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic.

      "body": "All New Relic Infrastructure accounts, regardless of subscription level, can use New Relic's Compute Engine integration to get a comprehensive, real-time view of their host's performance and status. New Relic Infrastructure's integration with Google Compute Engine reports metadata about instances (virtual machines) hosted on Google's infrastructure. You can monitor and alert on your GCP instances data from New Relic Infrastructure, and you can create custom queries and chart dashboards in New Relic Insights. Activate integration To enable the integration follow standard procedures to connect your GCP service to New Relic Infrastructure. Important You must install the Infrastructure agent on each GCE host to see metrics from that host. Connecting your Google Cloud projects allows Infrastructure to access GCE metadata, such as region, type, and tags. Polling frequency New Relic Infrastructure integrations query your GCP services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. The polling interval for the Google Compute Engine integration is 5 minutes. Find and use data After activating the integration and waiting a few minutes (based on the polling frequency), data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to your dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP > (select an integration). Metric data Metric data that New Relic receives from your GCP Compute Engine integration include: GcpVirtualMachineSample Name Description firewall.DroppedBytes Delta count of incoming bytes dropped by the firewall. firewall.DroppedPackets Delta count of incoming packets dropped by the firewall. instance.cpu.ReservedCores Total number of cores reserved on the host of the instance.

To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account.

To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account.

To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account.

To find and use integration data, including your dashboards and your alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP > Google Cloud Storage. To create custom dashboards for the integration, create queries for the GcpStorageBucketSample event type with the provider value GcpStorageBucket. Metric data The integration reports metric data for all values of method and response_code: response_code: The response code of the requests. method: The name of the API method called. The metric data that New Relic receives from your Google Cloud Storage integration includes: Metric Description api.Requests Delta count of API calls. network.ReceivedBytes Delta count of bytes received over the network. network.SentBytes Delta count of bytes sent over the network.

      "body": "To read the relevant data from your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account, New Relic uses the Google Stackdriver API and also other specific services APIs. To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account. List of permissions Common permissions All integrations need the following permission: monitoring.timeSeries.list serviceusage.services.use Service-specific permissions For some GCP integrations, New Relic will also need the following permissions, mainly to collect labels and inventory attributes. Integration Permissions Google AppEngine n/a; Google App Engine does not require additional permissions. Google BigQuery bigquery.datasets.get bigquery.tables.get bigquery.tables.list Google Cloud Functions cloudfunctions.locations.list Google Cloud Load Balancing n/a; Google Cloud Load Balancing does not require additional permissions.

After the projects are linked, assign a Google Cloud custom role to the authorized account. Use New Relic NerdGraph to link Google Cloud projects to New Relic. This does not involve listing the viewable projects. However, you must know the id of the project you want to monitor. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL cloud integrations API tutorial.",

To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account. List of permissions Common permissions All integrations need the following permission: monitoring.timeSeries.list serviceusage.services.use Service-specific permissions For some GCP integrations, New Relic will also need the following permissions, mainly to collect labels and inventory attributes.

After the projects are linked, assign a Google Cloud custom role to the authorized account. Use New Relic NerdGraph to link Google Cloud projects to New Relic. This does not involve listing the viewable projects. However, you must know the id of the project you want to monitor.

Tip To use Google Cloud Platform integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements These are the requirements for the authorization: GCP integration requirements Comments Monitoring In the GCP project API & Services Library settings, you must enable Google Stackdriver Monitoring API. Authorization For service account authorization (recommended): A user with Project IAM Admin role is needed to add the service account ID as a member in your GCP project. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the service account must have the Project Viewer role and the Service Usage Consumer role or, alternatively, a custom role. For user account authorization: The New Relic user that will integrate the GCP project must have a Google account and must be able to view the GCP project that New Relic will monitor. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the user must have the Project Viewer role. Please note that this authorization method will not allow New Relic to collect labels and other inventory attributes that can be useful for narrowing down your NRQL queries, dashboards and alerts. You can migrate the authorization method from user account to service account from the Manage services link in New Relic's user interface. Project name As part of the online setup process, you must identify Project name of the projects you want to monitor with New Relic. The UI workflow automatically lists active projects you can select. Permissions (only for user account authorization) New Relic requires a specific set of read-only permissions exclusively; this means that, for certain integrations, only partial inventory data will be available. Keep in mind that New Relic doesn't inherit your Google account's permissions and therefore is not authorized to perform any changes in the project. For more information about the API permissions that New Relic uses, see the Google documentation about scopes. Authorization options Integrating your GCP project with New Relic requires you to authorize New Relic to fetch monitoring data from your GCP project. You can choose between two authorization methods: Service accounts or User accounts. Service account (recommended) The service account authorization is recommended. If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a service account, we will call your GCP project APIs using a service account ID and its associated public/private key pair. New Relic manages a specific Google service account for your New Relic account; you do not need to create it or manage the associated private key. Just add the service account ID as a member with viewing permissions in your project. This authorization method is recommended, especially if your GCP project is managed by a team. It also guarantees that New Relic will collect labels and inventory attributes whenever possible. User account If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a user account, New Relic will access your GCP project monitoring data on behalf of a particular Google user. The authorization process is achieved through an OAuth workflow, which redirects you from the New Relic UI to a Google authorization interface. However, since the authorization is linked to a particular Google user, this method is not recommended for GCP projects that are managed by large teams. Connect GCP to New Relic infrastructure monitoring To connect your Google account to New Relic with user account authorization: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. At the top of Infrastructure's Google Cloud Services integrations page, select Add a GCP account. Choose Authorization Method: Select either Authorize a Service Account or Authorize a User Account, and follow the instructions in the UI to authorize New Relic. Add projects: Select the projects that you want New Relic to receive data from. Select services: From the list of available services for your GCP account, select the individual services you want New Relic to receive data from, or select all of the services. Tip These services will be enabled for all of the projects that you selected in the previous step. Once the setup process is finished, you can fine-tune the services that you want monitored for each project individually. To complete the setup process, select Finish. If you see API authentication errors, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Explore app data in New Relic After you authorize New Relic to integrate one or more of your Google project's services, New Relic starts monitoring your GCP data at regular polling intervals. After a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. Link multiple Google projects For your convenience, the setup process allows you to select more than one project at a time. After the first setup, if you need to monitor additional GCP projects with New Relic, you can repeat the procedure to connect your GCP services as many times as you need. Unlink your GCP integrations You can disable any of your GCP integrations any time and still keep your Google project connected to New Relic. If you want to... Do this Disable a GCP service monitoring To disconnect individual GCP services but keep the integration with New Relic for other GCP services in your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, make changes to the checkbox options for available services and select Save changes. Unlink your project monitoring To uninstall all of your GCP services completely from New Relic Integrations, unlink your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, select Unlink account and select Save changes. Clean your GCP Projects after unlinking New Relic To clean your GCP project after unlinking, follow these steps if you were using a service account: Open the GCP IAM Console. Select the project you want to unlink from New Relic and click Open. Select the service account that is used by New Relic. Click the Remove icon. Or follow these steps if you were using a user account: Open your Google user account settings. Open the Apps with access to your account section. Choose New Relic application. Choose Remove Access.",

      "body": "To start receiving Google Cloud Platform (GCP) data with New Relic GCP integrations, connect your Google project to New Relic infrastructure monitoring. Tip To use Google Cloud Platform integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements These are the requirements for the authorization: GCP integration requirements Comments Monitoring In the GCP project API & Services Library settings, you must enable Google Stackdriver Monitoring API. Authorization For service account authorization (recommended): A user with Project IAM Admin role is needed to add the service account ID as a member in your GCP project. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the service account must have the Project Viewer role and the Service Usage Consumer role or, alternatively, a custom role. For user account authorization: The New Relic user that will integrate the GCP project must have a Google account and must be able to view the GCP project that New Relic will monitor. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the user must have the Project Viewer role. Please note that this authorization method will not allow New Relic to collect labels and other inventory attributes that can be useful for narrowing down your NRQL queries, dashboards and alerts. You can migrate the authorization method from user account to service account from the Manage services link in New Relic's user interface. Project name As part of the online setup process, you must identify Project name of the projects you want to monitor with New Relic. The UI workflow automatically lists active projects you can select. Permissions (only for user account authorization) New Relic requires a specific set of read-only permissions exclusively; this means that, for certain integrations, only partial inventory data will be available. Keep in mind that New Relic doesn't inherit your Google account's permissions and therefore is not authorized to perform any changes in the project. For more information about the API permissions that New Relic uses, see the Google documentation about scopes. Authorization options Integrating your GCP project with New Relic requires you to authorize New Relic to fetch monitoring data from your GCP project. You can choose between two authorization methods: Service accounts or User accounts. Service account (recommended) The service account authorization is recommended. If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a service account, we will call your GCP project APIs using a service account ID and its associated public/private key pair. New Relic manages a specific Google service account for your New Relic account; you do not need to create it or manage the associated private key. Just add the service account ID as a member with viewing permissions in your project. This authorization method is recommended, especially if your GCP project is managed by a team. It also guarantees that New Relic will collect labels and inventory attributes whenever possible. User account If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a user account, New Relic will access your GCP project monitoring data on behalf of a particular Google user. The authorization process is achieved through an OAuth workflow, which redirects you from the New Relic UI to a Google authorization interface. However, since the authorization is linked to a particular Google user, this method is not recommended for GCP projects that are managed by large teams. Connect GCP to New Relic infrastructure monitoring To connect your Google account to New Relic with user account authorization: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. At the top of Infrastructure's Google Cloud Services integrations page, select Add a GCP account. Choose Authorization Method: Select either Authorize a Service Account or Authorize a User Account, and follow the instructions in the UI to authorize New Relic. Add projects: Select the projects that you want New Relic to receive data from. Select services: From the list of available services for your GCP account, select the individual services you want New Relic to receive data from, or select all of the services. Tip These services will be enabled for all of the projects that you selected in the previous step. Once the setup process is finished, you can fine-tune the services that you want monitored for each project individually. To complete the setup process, select Finish. If you see API authentication errors, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Explore app data in New Relic After you authorize New Relic to integrate one or more of your Google project's services, New Relic starts monitoring your GCP data at regular polling intervals. After a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. Link multiple Google projects For your convenience, the setup process allows you to select more than one project at a time. After the first setup, if you need to monitor additional GCP projects with New Relic, you can repeat the procedure to connect your GCP services as many times as you need. Unlink your GCP integrations You can disable any of your GCP integrations any time and still keep your Google project connected to New Relic. If you want to... Do this Disable a GCP service monitoring To disconnect individual GCP services but keep the integration with New Relic for other GCP services in your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, make changes to the checkbox options for available services and select Save changes. Unlink your project monitoring To uninstall all of your GCP services completely from New Relic Integrations, unlink your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, select Unlink account and select Save changes. Clean your GCP Projects after unlinking New Relic To clean your GCP project after unlinking, follow these steps if you were using a service account: Open the GCP IAM Console. Select the project you want to unlink from New Relic and click Open. Select the service account that is used by New Relic. Click the Remove icon. Or follow these steps if you were using a user account: Open your Google user account settings. Open the Apps with access to your account section. Choose New Relic application. Choose Remove Access.",

      "body": "To read the relevant data from your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account, New Relic uses the Google Stackdriver API and also other specific services APIs. To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account. List of permissions Common permissions All integrations need the following permission: monitoring.timeSeries.list serviceusage.services.use Service-specific permissions For some GCP integrations, New Relic will also need the following permissions, mainly to collect labels and inventory attributes.

After the projects are linked, assign a Google Cloud custom role to the authorized account. Use New Relic NerdGraph to link Google Cloud projects to New Relic. This does not involve listing the viewable projects. However, you must know the id of the project you want to monitor.

      "body": "To start receiving Google Cloud Platform (GCP) data with New Relic GCP integrations, connect your Google project to New Relic infrastructure monitoring. Tip To use Google Cloud Platform integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements These are the requirements for the authorization: GCP integration requirements Comments Monitoring In the GCP project API & Services Library settings, you must enable Google Stackdriver Monitoring API. Authorization For service account authorization (recommended): A user with Project IAM Admin role is needed to add the service account ID as a member in your GCP project. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the service account must have the Project Viewer role and the Service Usage Consumer role or, alternatively, a custom role. For user account authorization: The New Relic user that will integrate the GCP project must have a Google account and must be able to view the GCP project that New Relic will monitor. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the user must have the Project Viewer role. Please note that this authorization method will not allow New Relic to collect labels and other inventory attributes that can be useful for narrowing down your NRQL queries, dashboards and alerts. You can migrate the authorization method from user account to service account from the Manage services link in New Relic's user interface. Project name As part of the online setup process, you must identify Project name of the projects you want to monitor with New Relic. The UI workflow automatically lists active projects you can select. Permissions (only for user account authorization) New Relic requires a specific set of read-only permissions exclusively; this means that, for certain integrations, only partial inventory data will be available. Keep in mind that New Relic doesn't inherit your Google account's permissions and therefore is not authorized to perform any changes in the project. For more information about the API permissions that New Relic uses, see the Google documentation about scopes. Authorization options Integrating your GCP project with New Relic requires you to authorize New Relic to fetch monitoring data from your GCP project. You can choose between two authorization methods: Service accounts or User accounts. Service account (recommended) The service account authorization is recommended. If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a service account, we will call your GCP project APIs using a service account ID and its associated public/private key pair. New Relic manages a specific Google service account for your New Relic account; you do not need to create it or manage the associated private key. Just add the service account ID as a member with viewing permissions in your project. This authorization method is recommended, especially if your GCP project is managed by a team. It also guarantees that New Relic will collect labels and inventory attributes whenever possible. User account If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a user account, New Relic will access your GCP project monitoring data on behalf of a particular Google user. The authorization process is achieved through an OAuth workflow, which redirects you from the New Relic UI to a Google authorization interface. However, since the authorization is linked to a particular Google user, this method is not recommended for GCP projects that are managed by large teams. Connect GCP to New Relic infrastructure monitoring To connect your Google account to New Relic with user account authorization: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. At the top of Infrastructure's Google Cloud Services integrations page, select Add a GCP account. Choose Authorization Method: Select either Authorize a Service Account or Authorize a User Account, and follow the instructions in the UI to authorize New Relic. Add projects: Select the projects that you want New Relic to receive data from. Select services: From the list of available services for your GCP account, select the individual services you want New Relic to receive data from, or select all of the services. Tip These services will be enabled for all of the projects that you selected in the previous step. Once the setup process is finished, you can fine-tune the services that you want monitored for each project individually. To complete the setup process, select Finish. If you see API authentication errors, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Explore app data in New Relic After you authorize New Relic to integrate one or more of your Google project's services, New Relic starts monitoring your GCP data at regular polling intervals. After a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. Link multiple Google projects For your convenience, the setup process allows you to select more than one project at a time. After the first setup, if you need to monitor additional GCP projects with New Relic, you can repeat the procedure to connect your GCP services as many times as you need. Unlink your GCP integrations You can disable any of your GCP integrations any time and still keep your Google project connected to New Relic. If you want to... Do this Disable a GCP service monitoring To disconnect individual GCP services but keep the integration with New Relic for other GCP services in your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, make changes to the checkbox options for available services and select Save changes. Unlink your project monitoring To uninstall all of your GCP services completely from New Relic Integrations, unlink your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, select Unlink account and select Save changes. Clean your GCP Projects after unlinking New Relic To clean your GCP project after unlinking, follow these steps if you were using a service account: Open the GCP IAM Console. Select the project you want to unlink from New Relic and click Open. Select the service account that is used by New Relic. Click the Remove icon. Or follow these steps if you were using a user account: Open your Google user account settings. Open the Apps with access to your account section. Choose New Relic application. Choose Remove Access.",

      "body": "To read the relevant data from your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account, New Relic uses the Google Stackdriver API and also other specific services APIs. To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account. List of permissions Common permissions All integrations need the following permission: monitoring.timeSeries.list serviceusage.services.use Service-specific permissions For some GCP integrations, New Relic will also need the following permissions, mainly to collect labels and inventory attributes. Integration Permissions Google AppEngine n/a; Google App Engine does not require additional permissions. Google BigQuery bigquery.datasets.get bigquery.tables.get bigquery.tables.list Google Cloud Functions cloudfunctions.locations.list Google Cloud Load Balancing n/a; Google Cloud Load Balancing does not require additional permissions.

After the projects are linked, assign a Google Cloud custom role to the authorized account. Use New Relic NerdGraph to link Google Cloud projects to New Relic. This does not involve listing the viewable projects. However, you must know the id of the project you want to monitor. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL cloud integrations API tutorial.",

Tip To use Google Cloud Platform integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements These are the requirements for the authorization: GCP integration requirements Comments Monitoring In the GCP project API & Services Library settings, you must enable Google Stackdriver Monitoring API. Authorization For service account authorization (recommended): A user with Project IAM Admin role is needed to add the service account ID as a member in your GCP project. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the service account must have the Project Viewer role and the Service Usage Consumer role or, alternatively, a custom role. For user account authorization: The New Relic user that will integrate the GCP project must have a Google account and must be able to view the GCP project that New Relic will monitor. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the user must have the Project Viewer role. Please note that this authorization method will not allow New Relic to collect labels and other inventory attributes that can be useful for narrowing down your NRQL queries, dashboards and alerts. You can migrate the authorization method from user account to service account from the Manage services link in New Relic's user interface. Project name As part of the online setup process, you must identify Project name of the projects you want to monitor with New Relic. The UI workflow automatically lists active projects you can select. Permissions (only for user account authorization) New Relic requires a specific set of read-only permissions exclusively; this means that, for certain integrations, only partial inventory data will be available. Keep in mind that New Relic doesn't inherit your Google account's permissions and therefore is not authorized to perform any changes in the project. For more information about the API permissions that New Relic uses, see the Google documentation about scopes. Authorization options Integrating your GCP project with New Relic requires you to authorize New Relic to fetch monitoring data from your GCP project. You can choose between two authorization methods: Service accounts or User accounts. Service account (recommended) The service account authorization is recommended. If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a service account, we will call your GCP project APIs using a service account ID and its associated public/private key pair. New Relic manages a specific Google service account for your New Relic account; you do not need to create it or manage the associated private key. Just add the service account ID as a member with viewing permissions in your project. This authorization method is recommended, especially if your GCP project is managed by a team. It also guarantees that New Relic will collect labels and inventory attributes whenever possible. User account If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a user account, New Relic will access your GCP project monitoring data on behalf of a particular Google user. The authorization process is achieved through an OAuth workflow, which redirects you from the New Relic UI to a Google authorization interface. However, since the authorization is linked to a particular Google user, this method is not recommended for GCP projects that are managed by large teams. Connect GCP to New Relic infrastructure monitoring To connect your Google account to New Relic with user account authorization: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. At the top of Infrastructure's Google Cloud Services integrations page, select Add a GCP account. Choose Authorization Method: Select either Authorize a Service Account or Authorize a User Account, and follow the instructions in the UI to authorize New Relic. Add projects: Select the projects that you want New Relic to receive data from. Select services: From the list of available services for your GCP account, select the individual services you want New Relic to receive data from, or select all of the services. Tip These services will be enabled for all of the projects that you selected in the previous step. Once the setup process is finished, you can fine-tune the services that you want monitored for each project individually. To complete the setup process, select Finish. If you see API authentication errors, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Explore app data in New Relic After you authorize New Relic to integrate one or more of your Google project's services, New Relic starts monitoring your GCP data at regular polling intervals. After a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. Link multiple Google projects For your convenience, the setup process allows you to select more than one project at a time. After the first setup, if you need to monitor additional GCP projects with New Relic, you can repeat the procedure to connect your GCP services as many times as you need. Unlink your GCP integrations You can disable any of your GCP integrations any time and still keep your Google project connected to New Relic. If you want to... Do this Disable a GCP service monitoring To disconnect individual GCP services but keep the integration with New Relic for other GCP services in your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, make changes to the checkbox options for available services and select Save changes. Unlink your project monitoring To uninstall all of your GCP services completely from New Relic Integrations, unlink your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, select Unlink account and select Save changes. Clean your GCP Projects after unlinking New Relic To clean your GCP project after unlinking, follow these steps if you were using a service account: Open the GCP IAM Console. Select the project you want to unlink from New Relic and click Open. Select the service account that is used by New Relic. Click the Remove icon. Or follow these steps if you were using a user account: Open your Google user account settings. Open the Apps with access to your account section. Choose New Relic application.

To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account. List of permissions Common permissions All integrations need the following permission: monitoring.timeSeries.list serviceusage.services.use Service-specific permissions For some GCP integrations, New Relic will also need the following permissions, mainly to collect labels and inventory attributes.

After the projects are linked, assign a Google Cloud custom role to the authorized account. Use New Relic NerdGraph to link Google Cloud projects to New Relic. This does not involve listing the viewable projects. However, you must know the id of the project you want to monitor.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Retrieve data from New Relic. Send data to New Relic. Adjust settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our API endpoints. For developer-focused content on how to use and customize New Relic, see developer.newrelic.com. Tip To use APIs and SDKs, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL-format API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph is the preferred API for querying New Relic data and making a range of feature configurations. To get started, see Introduction to NerdGraph. REST APIs by capability New Relic capabilities, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, or alerts, are often used together, and sometimes they overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Tip To learn more about different API key types, see Understand New Relic API keys. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use the Query API. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The Browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the Browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To retrieve browser monitoring data, use the Query API. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To retrieve infrastructure data, use the Query API. This API can also be used to retrieve subscription usage data. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To retrieve Mobile data from New Relic, use the Query API. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To retrieve synthetics event data, use the Query API. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Telemetry APIs for core data types We offer several APIs that allow you to get our core data types (metrics, logs, traces, and events) into New Relic without the use of an installed agent. Data type Description Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic. Event API Send event data to New Relic. Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage You can use the Query API to retrieve subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API To retrieve information about your New Relic partner account, sub-accounts, and users, use the Partner API. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API To query your data using NRQL-format queries, you can use the Query API. Note that this API is deprecated and NerdGraph is preferred for querying your data. Dashboard API See the Insights Dashboard API. Plugins Use the REST API for New Relic plugins and the API Explorer to: Get a list of plugins, including their names, IDs, and GUIDs. List one or more plugin components, their output, and their metric timeslice data. Developers and New Relic partners can also use New Relic's Plugin API to write an agent in any language that can work directly with the API for plugins. This allows you to send your own metric data to our plugins and view data received from the API in New Relic.

Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports only x86 processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit architecture (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible linux operating sytems. Built-in log forwarding and on-host integrations are not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems: Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). Important Operating systems are not supported beyond manufacturer end-of-life. Tip You can monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Important Servers named localhost are not reported: it's a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

Use existing Grafana dashboards with New Relic When you integrate Prometheus metrics with New Relic via Remote Write or the OpenMetrics Integration (2.0+) and configure New Relic as a Prometheus data source in Grafana, you can use existing Grafana dashboards and seamlessly tap into the additional monitoring, reliability, and scale we provide. Compatibility and requirements Before you begin, make sure you’ve finished integrating Prometheus metrics and are running a recent enough version of Grafana. You should have either the Remote Write or the OpenMetrics Integration ( v2.0+) set up before you can configure New Relic Prometheus data sources in Grafana. You can only configure New Relic Prometheus data sources using this method in Grafana versions 6.7.0 or newer. You will need to configure custom headers in the UI, and this isn’t possible with earlier versions. For details, see Configure New Relic as a Prometheus data source for Grafana. Support for PromQL Our Prometheus API emulates Prometheus' query APIs. We support the Prometheus query language (PromQL) through our PromQL-style query mode. We do our best to automatically translate PromQL syntax queries into the closest NRQL approximation. For more information on how this works and differences you may observe between Prometheus and New Relic, see Supported PromQL features. Get data flowing in Grafana To make your New Relic data available in Grafana, you can configure a new or existing Prometheus data source in just a couple of simple steps: In the Grafana UI, add and configure a new data source. Save the new data source and start viewing your data. What’s next? Ready to configure a Grafana data source?

We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server.

Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems: Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). Important Operating systems are not supported beyond manufacturer end-of-life. Tip You can monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Important Servers named localhost are not reported: it's a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Microsoft SQL Server integration links.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern. Useful if using a wildcard query exclude_regex: # This will match any bean where the name is YoungGen - name=YoungGen attributes: - attr: LastGcInfo.GcThreadCount metric_type: gauge metric_name: GCThreadCount # Domains can be wildcarded - domain: java.util.* # If the domain is wildcarded, a custom event must be defined event_type: JavaUtilSample beans: # If no attributes are defined, all are collected by default - query: type=Logging Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Microsoft SQL Server integration links.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern. Useful if using a wildcard query exclude_regex: # This will match any bean where the name is YoungGen - name=YoungGen attributes: - attr: LastGcInfo.GcThreadCount metric_type: gauge metric_name: GCThreadCount # Domains can be wildcarded - domain: java.util.* # If the domain is wildcarded, a custom event must be defined event_type: JavaUtilSample beans: # If no attributes are defined, all are collected by default - query: type=Logging Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used.

Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern. Useful if using a wildcard query exclude_regex: # This will match any bean where the name is YoungGen - name=YoungGen attributes: - attr: LastGcInfo.GcThreadCount metric_type: gauge metric_name: GCThreadCount # Domains can be wildcarded - domain: java.util.* # If the domain is wildcarded, a custom event must be defined event_type: JavaUtilSample beans: # If no attributes are defined, all are collected by default - query: type=Logging Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Microsoft SQL Server integration links.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern. Useful if using a wildcard query exclude_regex: # This will match any bean where the name is YoungGen - name=YoungGen attributes: - attr: LastGcInfo.GcThreadCount metric_type: gauge metric_name: GCThreadCount # Domains can be wildcarded - domain: java.util.* # If the domain is wildcarded, a custom event must be defined event_type: JavaUtilSample beans: # If no attributes are defined, all are collected by default - query: type=Logging Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user.

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern.

Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern.

Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click the Guided install button. If your account reports data through our EU datacenter, click EU Guided install. Guided install EU Guided install Our infrastructure agent discovers the applications and infrastructure and log sources running in your environment, and recommends which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Supported APM agents If you have a .NET Windows application on IIS, the guided install configures and enables an APM agent. Guided install for .NET EU Guided install for .NET Why it matters With our guided install, you can instrument your applications and infrastructure and start seeing your data in New Relic in minutes. The guided install uses our command line interface (CLI), the infrastructure agent for your host environment, and a library of installation recipes to instrument your applications and infrastructure for you. That means less toil for you. Because our instrumentation recipes are open source, you can modify existing recipes, or build new ones, to suit your needs. Some technical detail The New Relic guided install uses open source installation recipes to instrument on-host integrations. These recipes include installation and setup commands, information about logs, and metadata related to what’s being installed. They're collected in a YAML file for each type of system and have all of the installation details necessary to install the infrastructure agent for a specific integration. Important On Windows, our guided install only supports Microsoft SQL Server, logs, and the infrastructure agent. All other integrations are only supported on Linux. On-host integration (OHI) recipes The guided install automates the discovery, configuration, and installation of OHIs. However, there may be times when you want to instrument them one-by-one using the CLI install command. To install any individual on-host integration, run this command: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=API_KEY NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=ACCOUNT_ID /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n INTEGRATION-FLAG Copy For example: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=<API_KEY> NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID> /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n apache-open-source-integration Copy The table lists the integrations supported by the guided install CLI command. The specific on-host integration commands are provided for your reference. Our open source integrations send performance metrics and inventory data from your servers and applications to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts.

MySQL: Incorrect user permissions To monitor MySQL health data, you need a valid username and password with specific permissions. These commands will create a user and grant the required permissions: Create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD';\" Copy Give replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Give select privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Once done, your next guided install attempt should work. NGINX: No status URL To monitor your NGINX server, you'll need to configure a valid status URL. status_url: The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. If the default value of 127.0.0.1 is incorrect, substitute the address/FQDN/URL for your system.

See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Microsoft SQL Server integration links.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern. Useful if using a wildcard query exclude_regex: # This will match any bean where the name is YoungGen - name=YoungGen attributes: - attr: LastGcInfo.GcThreadCount metric_type: gauge metric_name: GCThreadCount # Domains can be wildcarded - domain: java.util.* # If the domain is wildcarded, a custom event must be defined event_type: JavaUtilSample beans: # If no attributes are defined, all are collected by default - query: type=Logging Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern.

Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern. Useful if using a wildcard query exclude_regex: # This will match any bean where the name is YoungGen - name=YoungGen attributes: - attr: LastGcInfo.GcThreadCount metric_type: gauge metric_name: GCThreadCount # Domains can be wildcarded - domain: java.util.* # If the domain is wildcarded, a custom event must be defined event_type: JavaUtilSample beans: # If no attributes are defined, all are collected by default - query: type=Logging Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic's VMware vSphere integration helps you understand the health and performance of your vSphere environment. You can: Query data to get insights on the performance on your hypervisors, virtual machines, and more. Go from high level views down to the most granular data. vSphere data visualized in a New Relic dashboard includes operating systems, status, average CPU and memory consumption, and more. Our integration uses the vSphere API to collect metrics and events generated by all vSphere's components, and forwards the data to our platform via the infrastructure agent. Why it matters With our vSphere integration you can: Instrument and monitor multiple vSphere instances using the same account. Collect data on snapshots, VMs, hosts, resource pools, clusters, and datastores, including tags. Monitor the health of your hypervisors and VMs using our charts and dashboards. Use the data retrieved to monitor key performance and key capacity scaling indicators. Set alerts based on any metrics collected from vCenter. Create workloads to group resources and focus on key data. You can create workloads using data collected via the vSphere integration. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with VMware vSphere 6.5 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent installed on a host vCenter service account having at least read-only global permissions with the propagate to children option checked Important Large environments: In environments with more than 800 virtual machines, the integration cannot report all data and may fail. We offer a workaround that will preserve all metrics and events, but it will disable entity registration. To apply the workaround, add the following environment variable to the configuration file: EVENTS: true and METRICS: true Copy Install and activate To install the vSphere integration, choose your setup: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-vsphere. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp vsphere-config.yml.sample vsphere-config.yml Copy Edit the vsphere-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-vsphere MSI installer image from: download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-vsphere/nri-vsphere-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-vsphere-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp vsphere-config.yml.sample vsphere-config.yml Copy Edit the vsphere-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Tarball installation (advanced) You can also install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. To configure the vSphere integration, you must define the URL of the vSphere API endpoint, and your vSphere username and password. For configuration examples, see the sample configuration files. Some vSphere integration features are optional and can be enabled via configuration settings. In addition, with secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. Enable and configure performance metrics (Beta) Performance metrics provide a better understanding of the current status of VMware resources and can be collected in addition to the metrics collected by default;and included in the samples;described at the bottom of the page. All metrics collected are included in the corresponding sample with the perf. prefix attached to the name. For example, net.packetsRx.summation is collected and sent as perf.net.packetsRx.summation. To collect vSphere performance metrics, use the ENABLE_VSPHERE_PERF_METRICS environment variable. Data is collected according to the settings in the vsphere-performance.metrics configuration file. You can override the location of the performance metrics config file using PERF_METRIC_FILE environment variable. Notice that the integration follows VMware's data collection levels (1 to 4). When ENABLE_VSPHERE_PERF_METRICS is set, all level 1 metrics are collected. The data collection level of the performance metrics collected can be modified using PERF_LEVEL. Each metric in the config file can be commented out and new ones can be added if needed. Caution Collection of performance data can increase the load in vCenter and the time needed by to collect data. We recommended to only include the metrics you need in the configuration file. To fine-tune data collection, the number of entities and metrics retrieved per request can be modified using BATCH_SIZE_PERF_ENTITIES and BATCH_SIZE_PERF_METRICS. Tip For more information on vSphere performance metrics, see the VMware documentation. Collect vSphere events (Beta) To collect vSphere events, use the ENABLE_VSPHERE_EVENTS environment variable. The integration collects events between the current time and the last fetched event for each datacenter. It stores the information regarding the last fetched event in a cache that is updated after each execution. Events are only available if the integration is connected to a vCenter and not directly to an ESXi host. The number of events collected per request can be tuned by modifying EVENTS_PAGE_SIZE, which is set to 100 by default. Events are available in the Events page and can be queried via NRQL as InfrastructureEvent under vSphereEvent. Here is an example of vSphere events data: \"summary\": \"User dcui@127.0.0.1 logged out (login time: Tuesday, 14 July, 2020 08:32:09 AM, number of API invocations: 0, user agent: VMware-client/6.5.0)\", \"vSphereEvent.computeResource\": \"cluster1\", \"vSphereEvent.datacenter\": \"Prod Datacenter\", \"vSphereEvent.date\": \"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 09:03:51 UTC\", \"vSphereEvent.host\": \"192.168.0.230\", \"vSphereEvent.userName\": \"dcui\" Copy Collect snapshots data (Beta) To collect snapshot data, use the ENABLE_VSPHERE_SNAPSHOTS environment variable. Snapshot data can be found in VSphereSnapshotVmSample. Collected data covers total and unique space occupied by disk and memory files, snapshot tree, and creation time. You can use this information to create NRQL queries, dashboards, and alerts, since it's linked to the corresponding virtual machine entity. Collect vSphere tags (Beta) To collect vSphere tags, use the ENABLE_VSPHERE_TAGS environment variable. Tags are available as attributes in the corresponding entity sample as label.tagCategory:tagName. If two tags of the same category are assigned to a resource, they are added to a unique attribute separated by a pipe character. For example: label.tagCategory:tagName|tagName2. Tags can be used to run NRQL queries, filter entities in the New Relic Explorer, and to create dashboards and alerts. Filter resources by tags (Beta) Resource filtering allows you to specify which resources you want to monitor by declaring a set of tags that resources must have in order to be monitored. Resources require a match on any (one or more) of the filter tags in order to be included. If none of the resource tags match any of the filter tags, no information about that resource is sent to New Relic. To use filtering resources by tag you need to have the ENABLE_VSPHERE_TAGS environment variable enabled. A tag filter expression is a space-separated list of pairs of strings with the format category=name. For example, to only retrieve resources with a tag category region and include regions us and eu use a filter expression like: region=us region=eu INCLUDE_TAGS: > region=us region=eu Copy To enable resource filtering by tag, edit your integration configuration file and add the option INCLUDE_TAGS with the filter expression you want. Caution Note that datacenter resources acting as the root of the resource tree MUST have tags attached AND match the filter expression in order for other child resources to be fetched. Important If you connect the integration directly to the ESXi host, vCenter data is not available (for example, events, tags, or datacenter metadata). Example configuration Here are examples of the vSphere integration configuration, including performance metrics: vsphere-config.yml.sample (Linux) vsphere-win-config.yml.sample (Windows) vsphere-performance.metrics (Performance metrics) For more information, see our documentation about the general structure of on-host integration configurations. Important The configuration option inventory_source is not compatible with this integration. Update your integration On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. View and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. vSphere data is attached to these event types: VSphereHostSample VSphereClusterSample VSphereVmSample VSphereDatastoreSample VSphereDatacenterSample VSphereResourcePoolSample VSphereSnapshotVmSample Performance data is enabled and configured separately (see Enable and configure performance metrics). For more on how to view and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The vSphere integration provides metric data attached to the following New Relic events: VSphereHost VSphereVm VSphereDatastore VSphereDatacenter VSphereResourcePool VSphereCluster VSphereSnapshotVm VSphereHost Name Description cpu.totalMHz Sum of the MHz for all the individual cores on the host cpu.coreMHz Speed of the CPU cores cpu.available Amount of free CPU MHz in the host cpu.overallUsage CPU usage across all cores on the host in MHz cpu.percent Percentage of CPU utilization in the host cpu.cores Number of physical CPU cores on the host. Physical CPU cores are the processors contained by a CPU package cpu.threads Number of physical CPU threads on the host disk.totalMiB Total capacity of disks mounted in host, in MiB mem.free Amount of available memory in the host, in MiB mem.usage Amount of used memory in the host, in MiB mem.size Total memory capacity of the host, in MiB vmCount Number of virtual machines in the host hypervisorHostname Name of the host uuid The hardware BIOS identification datacenterName Name of the datacenter related to the host clusterName Name of the cluster related to the host resourcePoolNameList List of names of the resource pools related to the host datastoreNameList List of names of datastores related to the host datacenterLocation Datacenter location networkNameList List of names of networks related to the host overallStatus gray: Status is unknown green: Entity is OK yellow: Entity might have a problem red: Entity definitely has a problem connectionState The host connection state: connected: Connected to the server. For ESX Server, this is the default setting. disconnected: The user has explicitly taken the host down. VirtualCenter does not expect to receive heartbeats from the host. The next time a heartbeat is received, the host is moved to the connected state again and an event is logged. notResponding: VirtualCenter is not receiving heartbeats from the server. The state automatically changes to connected once heartbeats are received again. This state is typically used to trigger an alarm on the host. inMaintenanceMode The flag to indicate whether or not the host is in maintenance mode. This flag is set when the host has entered the maintenance mode. It is not set during the entering phase of maintenance mode. inQuarantineMode The flag to indicate whether or not the host is in quarantine mode. InfraUpdateHa will recommend to set this flag based on the HealthUpdates received by the HealthUpdateProviders configured for the cluster. A host that is reported as degraded will be recommended to enter quarantine mode, while a host that is reported as healthy will be recommended to exit quarantine mode. Execution of these recommended actions will set this flag. Hosts in quarantine mode will be avoided by vSphere DRS as long as the increased consolidation in the cluster does not negatively affect VM performance. powerState The host power state: poweredOff: The host was specifically powered off by the user through VirtualCenter. This state is not a cetain state, because after VirtualCenter issues the command to power off the host, the host might crash, or kill all the processes but fail to power off. poweredOn: The host is powered on. A host that is entering standby mode entering is also in this state. standBy: The host was specifically put in standby mode, either explicitly by the user or automatically by DPM. This state is not a certain state, because after VirtualCenter issues the command to put the host in standby state, the host might crash, or kill all the processes but fail to power off. A host that is exiting standby mode s also in this state. unknown: If the host is disconnected or notResponding, we know its power state, so the host is marked as unknown. standbyMode The host’s standby mode. The property is only populated by vCenter server. If queried directly from the ESX host, the property is unset. entering: The host is entering standby mode. exiting: The host is exiting standby mode. in: The host is in standby mode. none: The host is not in standby mode, and it is not in the process of entering or exiting standby mode. cryptoState Encryption state of the host. Valid values are enumerated by the CryptoState type: incapable: The host is not safe for receiving sensitive material. prepared: The host is prepared for receiving sensitive material but does not have a host key set yet. safe: The host is crypto safe and has a host key set. bootTime The time when the host was booted.

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern. Useful if using a wildcard query exclude_regex: # This will match any bean where the name is YoungGen - name=YoungGen attributes: - attr: LastGcInfo.GcThreadCount metric_type: gauge metric_name: GCThreadCount # Domains can be wildcarded - domain: java.util.* # If the domain is wildcarded, a custom event must be defined event_type: JavaUtilSample beans: # If no attributes are defined, all are collected by default - query: type=Logging Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern. Useful if using a wildcard query exclude_regex: # This will match any bean where the name is YoungGen - name=YoungGen attributes: - attr: LastGcInfo.GcThreadCount metric_type: gauge metric_name: GCThreadCount # Domains can be wildcarded - domain: java.util.* # If the domain is wildcarded, a custom event must be defined event_type: JavaUtilSample beans: # If no attributes are defined, all are collected by default - query: type=Logging Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern. Useful if using a wildcard query exclude_regex: # This will match any bean where the name is YoungGen - name=YoungGen attributes: - attr: LastGcInfo.GcThreadCount metric_type: gauge metric_name: GCThreadCount # Domains can be wildcarded - domain: java.util.* # If the domain is wildcarded, a custom event must be defined event_type: JavaUtilSample beans: # If no attributes are defined, all are collected by default - query: type=Logging Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "New Relic's VMware vSphere integration helps you understand the health and performance of your vSphere environment. You can: Query data to get insights on the performance on your hypervisors, virtual machines, and more. Go from high level views down to the most granular data. vSphere data visualized in a New Relic dashboard includes operating systems, status, average CPU and memory consumption, and more. Our integration uses the vSphere API to collect metrics and events generated by all vSphere's components, and forwards the data to our platform via the infrastructure agent. Why it matters With our vSphere integration you can: Instrument and monitor multiple vSphere instances using the same account. Collect data on snapshots, VMs, hosts, resource pools, clusters, and datastores, including tags. Monitor the health of your hypervisors and VMs using our charts and dashboards. Use the data retrieved to monitor key performance and key capacity scaling indicators. Set alerts based on any metrics collected from vCenter. Create workloads to group resources and focus on key data. You can create workloads using data collected via the vSphere integration. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with VMware vSphere 6.5 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent installed on a host vCenter service account having at least read-only global permissions with the propagate to children option checked Important Large environments: In environments with more than 800 virtual machines, the integration cannot report all data and may fail. We offer a workaround that will preserve all metrics and events, but it will disable entity registration. To apply the workaround, add the following environment variable to the configuration file: EVENTS: true and METRICS: true Copy Install and activate To install the vSphere integration, choose your setup: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-vsphere. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp vsphere-config.yml.sample vsphere-config.yml Copy Edit the vsphere-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-vsphere MSI installer image from: download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-vsphere/nri-vsphere-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-vsphere-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp vsphere-config.yml.sample vsphere-config.yml Copy Edit the vsphere-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Tarball installation (advanced) You can also install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. To configure the vSphere integration, you must define the URL of the vSphere API endpoint, and your vSphere username and password. For configuration examples, see the sample configuration files. Some vSphere integration features are optional and can be enabled via configuration settings. In addition, with secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. Enable and configure performance metrics (Beta) Performance metrics provide a better understanding of the current status of VMware resources and can be collected in addition to the metrics collected by default;and included in the samples;described at the bottom of the page. All metrics collected are included in the corresponding sample with the perf. prefix attached to the name. For example, net.packetsRx.summation is collected and sent as perf.net.packetsRx.summation. To collect vSphere performance metrics, use the ENABLE_VSPHERE_PERF_METRICS environment variable. Data is collected according to the settings in the vsphere-performance.metrics configuration file. You can override the location of the performance metrics config file using PERF_METRIC_FILE environment variable. Notice that the integration follows VMware's data collection levels (1 to 4). When ENABLE_VSPHERE_PERF_METRICS is set, all level 1 metrics are collected. The data collection level of the performance metrics collected can be modified using PERF_LEVEL. Each metric in the config file can be commented out and new ones can be added if needed. Caution Collection of performance data can increase the load in vCenter and the time needed by to collect data. We recommended to only include the metrics you need in the configuration file. To fine-tune data collection, the number of entities and metrics retrieved per request can be modified using BATCH_SIZE_PERF_ENTITIES and BATCH_SIZE_PERF_METRICS. Tip For more information on vSphere performance metrics, see the VMware documentation. Collect vSphere events (Beta) To collect vSphere events, use the ENABLE_VSPHERE_EVENTS environment variable. The integration collects events between the current time and the last fetched event for each datacenter. It stores the information regarding the last fetched event in a cache that is updated after each execution. Events are only available if the integration is connected to a vCenter and not directly to an ESXi host. The number of events collected per request can be tuned by modifying EVENTS_PAGE_SIZE, which is set to 100 by default. Events are available in the Events page and can be queried via NRQL as InfrastructureEvent under vSphereEvent. Here is an example of vSphere events data: \"summary\": \"User dcui@127.0.0.1 logged out (login time: Tuesday, 14 July, 2020 08:32:09 AM, number of API invocations: 0, user agent: VMware-client/6.5.0)\", \"vSphereEvent.computeResource\": \"cluster1\", \"vSphereEvent.datacenter\": \"Prod Datacenter\", \"vSphereEvent.date\": \"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 09:03:51 UTC\", \"vSphereEvent.host\": \"192.168.0.230\", \"vSphereEvent.userName\": \"dcui\" Copy Collect snapshots data (Beta) To collect snapshot data, use the ENABLE_VSPHERE_SNAPSHOTS environment variable. Snapshot data can be found in VSphereSnapshotVmSample. Collected data covers total and unique space occupied by disk and memory files, snapshot tree, and creation time. You can use this information to create NRQL queries, dashboards, and alerts, since it's linked to the corresponding virtual machine entity. Collect vSphere tags (Beta) To collect vSphere tags, use the ENABLE_VSPHERE_TAGS environment variable. Tags are available as attributes in the corresponding entity sample as label.tagCategory:tagName. If two tags of the same category are assigned to a resource, they are added to a unique attribute separated by a pipe character. For example: label.tagCategory:tagName|tagName2. Tags can be used to run NRQL queries, filter entities in the New Relic Explorer, and to create dashboards and alerts. Filter resources by tags (Beta) Resource filtering allows you to specify which resources you want to monitor by declaring a set of tags that resources must have in order to be monitored. Resources require a match on any (one or more) of the filter tags in order to be included. If none of the resource tags match any of the filter tags, no information about that resource is sent to New Relic. To use filtering resources by tag you need to have the ENABLE_VSPHERE_TAGS environment variable enabled. A tag filter expression is a space-separated list of pairs of strings with the format category=name. For example, to only retrieve resources with a tag category region and include regions us and eu use a filter expression like: region=us region=eu INCLUDE_TAGS: > region=us region=eu Copy To enable resource filtering by tag, edit your integration configuration file and add the option INCLUDE_TAGS with the filter expression you want. Caution Note that datacenter resources acting as the root of the resource tree MUST have tags attached AND match the filter expression in order for other child resources to be fetched. Important If you connect the integration directly to the ESXi host, vCenter data is not available (for example, events, tags, or datacenter metadata). Example configuration Here are examples of the vSphere integration configuration, including performance metrics: vsphere-config.yml.sample (Linux) vsphere-win-config.yml.sample (Windows) vsphere-performance.metrics (Performance metrics) For more information, see our documentation about the general structure of on-host integration configurations. Important The configuration option inventory_source is not compatible with this integration. Update your integration On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. View and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. vSphere data is attached to these event types: VSphereHostSample VSphereClusterSample VSphereVmSample VSphereDatastoreSample VSphereDatacenterSample VSphereResourcePoolSample VSphereSnapshotVmSample Performance data is enabled and configured separately (see Enable and configure performance metrics). For more on how to view and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The vSphere integration provides metric data attached to the following New Relic events: VSphereHost VSphereVm VSphereDatastore VSphereDatacenter VSphereResourcePool VSphereCluster VSphereSnapshotVm VSphereHost Name Description cpu.totalMHz Sum of the MHz for all the individual cores on the host cpu.coreMHz Speed of the CPU cores cpu.available Amount of free CPU MHz in the host cpu.overallUsage CPU usage across all cores on the host in MHz cpu.percent Percentage of CPU utilization in the host cpu.cores Number of physical CPU cores on the host. Physical CPU cores are the processors contained by a CPU package cpu.threads Number of physical CPU threads on the host disk.totalMiB Total capacity of disks mounted in host, in MiB mem.free Amount of available memory in the host, in MiB mem.usage Amount of used memory in the host, in MiB mem.size Total memory capacity of the host, in MiB vmCount Number of virtual machines in the host hypervisorHostname Name of the host uuid The hardware BIOS identification datacenterName Name of the datacenter related to the host clusterName Name of the cluster related to the host resourcePoolNameList List of names of the resource pools related to the host datastoreNameList List of names of datastores related to the host datacenterLocation Datacenter location networkNameList List of names of networks related to the host overallStatus gray: Status is unknown green: Entity is OK yellow: Entity might have a problem red: Entity definitely has a problem connectionState The host connection state: connected: Connected to the server. For ESX Server, this is the default setting. disconnected: The user has explicitly taken the host down. VirtualCenter does not expect to receive heartbeats from the host. The next time a heartbeat is received, the host is moved to the connected state again and an event is logged. notResponding: VirtualCenter is not receiving heartbeats from the server. The state automatically changes to connected once heartbeats are received again. This state is typically used to trigger an alarm on the host. inMaintenanceMode The flag to indicate whether or not the host is in maintenance mode. This flag is set when the host has entered the maintenance mode. It is not set during the entering phase of maintenance mode. inQuarantineMode The flag to indicate whether or not the host is in quarantine mode. InfraUpdateHa will recommend to set this flag based on the HealthUpdates received by the HealthUpdateProviders configured for the cluster. A host that is reported as degraded will be recommended to enter quarantine mode, while a host that is reported as healthy will be recommended to exit quarantine mode. Execution of these recommended actions will set this flag. Hosts in quarantine mode will be avoided by vSphere DRS as long as the increased consolidation in the cluster does not negatively affect VM performance. powerState The host power state: poweredOff: The host was specifically powered off by the user through VirtualCenter. This state is not a cetain state, because after VirtualCenter issues the command to power off the host, the host might crash, or kill all the processes but fail to power off. poweredOn: The host is powered on. A host that is entering standby mode entering is also in this state. standBy: The host was specifically put in standby mode, either explicitly by the user or automatically by DPM. This state is not a certain state, because after VirtualCenter issues the command to put the host in standby state, the host might crash, or kill all the processes but fail to power off. A host that is exiting standby mode s also in this state. unknown: If the host is disconnected or notResponding, we know its power state, so the host is marked as unknown. standbyMode The host’s standby mode. The property is only populated by vCenter server. If queried directly from the ESX host, the property is unset. entering: The host is entering standby mode. exiting: The host is exiting standby mode. in: The host is in standby mode. none: The host is not in standby mode, and it is not in the process of entering or exiting standby mode. cryptoState Encryption state of the host. Valid values are enumerated by the CryptoState type: incapable: The host is not safe for receiving sensitive material. prepared: The host is prepared for receiving sensitive material but does not have a host key set yet. safe: The host is crypto safe and has a host key set. bootTime The time when the host was booted.

We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user.

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern.

Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern. Useful if using a wildcard query exclude_regex: # This will match any bean where the name is YoungGen - name=YoungGen attributes: - attr: LastGcInfo.GcThreadCount metric_type: gauge metric_name: GCThreadCount # Domains can be wildcarded - domain: java.util.* # If the domain is wildcarded, a custom event must be defined event_type: JavaUtilSample beans: # If no attributes are defined, all are collected by default - query: type=Logging Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss.

Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern. Useful if using a wildcard query exclude_regex: # This will match any bean where the name is YoungGen - name=YoungGen attributes: - attr: LastGcInfo.GcThreadCount metric_type: gauge metric_name: GCThreadCount # Domains can be wildcarded - domain: java.util.* # If the domain is wildcarded, a custom event must be defined event_type: JavaUtilSample beans: # If no attributes are defined, all are collected by default - query: type=Logging Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss.

Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern. Useful if using a wildcard query exclude_regex: # This will match any bean where the name is YoungGen - name=YoungGen attributes: - attr: LastGcInfo.GcThreadCount metric_type: gauge metric_name: GCThreadCount # Domains can be wildcarded - domain: java.util.* # If the domain is wildcarded, a custom event must be defined event_type: JavaUtilSample beans: # If no attributes are defined, all are collected by default - query: type=Logging Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern.

Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern. Useful if using a wildcard query exclude_regex: # This will match any bean where the name is YoungGen - name=YoungGen attributes: - attr: LastGcInfo.GcThreadCount metric_type: gauge metric_name: GCThreadCount # Domains can be wildcarded - domain: java.util.* # If the domain is wildcarded, a custom event must be defined event_type: JavaUtilSample beans: # If no attributes are defined, all are collected by default - query: type=Logging Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern.

Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern. Useful if using a wildcard query exclude_regex: # This will match any bean where the name is YoungGen - name=YoungGen attributes: - attr: LastGcInfo.GcThreadCount metric_type: gauge metric_name: GCThreadCount # Domains can be wildcarded - domain: java.util.* # If the domain is wildcarded, a custom event must be defined event_type: JavaUtilSample beans: # If no attributes are defined, all are collected by default - query: type=Logging Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss.

Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern. Useful if using a wildcard query exclude_regex: # This will match any bean where the name is YoungGen - name=YoungGen attributes: - attr: LastGcInfo.GcThreadCount metric_type: gauge metric_name: GCThreadCount # Domains can be wildcarded - domain: java.util.* # If the domain is wildcarded, a custom event must be defined event_type: JavaUtilSample beans: # If no attributes are defined, all are collected by default - query: type=Logging Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss.

Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern. Useful if using a wildcard query exclude_regex: # This will match any bean where the name is YoungGen - name=YoungGen attributes: - attr: LastGcInfo.GcThreadCount metric_type: gauge metric_name: GCThreadCount # Domains can be wildcarded - domain: java.util.* # If the domain is wildcarded, a custom event must be defined event_type: JavaUtilSample beans: # If no attributes are defined, all are collected by default - query: type=Logging Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute.

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern.

Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub.

      "body": "New Relic's VMware vSphere integration helps you understand the health and performance of your vSphere environment. You can: Query data to get insights on the performance on your hypervisors, virtual machines, and more. Go from high level views down to the most granular data. vSphere data visualized in a New Relic dashboard includes operating systems, status, average CPU and memory consumption, and more. Our integration uses the vSphere API to collect metrics and events generated by all vSphere's components, and forwards the data to our platform via the infrastructure agent. Why it matters With our vSphere integration you can: Instrument and monitor multiple vSphere instances using the same account. Collect data on snapshots, VMs, hosts, resource pools, clusters, and datastores, including tags. Monitor the health of your hypervisors and VMs using our charts and dashboards. Use the data retrieved to monitor key performance and key capacity scaling indicators. Set alerts based on any metrics collected from vCenter. Create workloads to group resources and focus on key data. You can create workloads using data collected via the vSphere integration. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with VMware vSphere 6.5 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent installed on a host vCenter service account having at least read-only global permissions with the propagate to children option checked Important Large environments: In environments with more than 800 virtual machines, the integration cannot report all data and may fail. We offer a workaround that will preserve all metrics and events, but it will disable entity registration. To apply the workaround, add the following environment variable to the configuration file: EVENTS: true and METRICS: true Copy Install and activate To install the vSphere integration, choose your setup: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-vsphere. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp vsphere-config.yml.sample vsphere-config.yml Copy Edit the vsphere-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-vsphere MSI installer image from: download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-vsphere/nri-vsphere-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-vsphere-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp vsphere-config.yml.sample vsphere-config.yml Copy Edit the vsphere-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Tarball installation (advanced) You can also install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. To configure the vSphere integration, you must define the URL of the vSphere API endpoint, and your vSphere username and password. For configuration examples, see the sample configuration files. Some vSphere integration features are optional and can be enabled via configuration settings. In addition, with secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. Enable and configure performance metrics (Beta) Performance metrics provide a better understanding of the current status of VMware resources and can be collected in addition to the metrics collected by default;and included in the samples;described at the bottom of the page. All metrics collected are included in the corresponding sample with the perf. prefix attached to the name. For example, net.packetsRx.summation is collected and sent as perf.net.packetsRx.summation. To collect vSphere performance metrics, use the ENABLE_VSPHERE_PERF_METRICS environment variable. Data is collected according to the settings in the vsphere-performance.metrics configuration file. You can override the location of the performance metrics config file using PERF_METRIC_FILE environment variable. Notice that the integration follows VMware's data collection levels (1 to 4). When ENABLE_VSPHERE_PERF_METRICS is set, all level 1 metrics are collected. The data collection level of the performance metrics collected can be modified using PERF_LEVEL. Each metric in the config file can be commented out and new ones can be added if needed. Caution Collection of performance data can increase the load in vCenter and the time needed by to collect data. We recommended to only include the metrics you need in the configuration file. To fine-tune data collection, the number of entities and metrics retrieved per request can be modified using BATCH_SIZE_PERF_ENTITIES and BATCH_SIZE_PERF_METRICS. Tip For more information on vSphere performance metrics, see the VMware documentation. Collect vSphere events (Beta) To collect vSphere events, use the ENABLE_VSPHERE_EVENTS environment variable. The integration collects events between the current time and the last fetched event for each datacenter. It stores the information regarding the last fetched event in a cache that is updated after each execution. Events are only available if the integration is connected to a vCenter and not directly to an ESXi host. The number of events collected per request can be tuned by modifying EVENTS_PAGE_SIZE, which is set to 100 by default. Events are available in the Events page and can be queried via NRQL as InfrastructureEvent under vSphereEvent. Here is an example of vSphere events data: \"summary\": \"User dcui@127.0.0.1 logged out (login time: Tuesday, 14 July, 2020 08:32:09 AM, number of API invocations: 0, user agent: VMware-client/6.5.0)\", \"vSphereEvent.computeResource\": \"cluster1\", \"vSphereEvent.datacenter\": \"Prod Datacenter\", \"vSphereEvent.date\": \"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 09:03:51 UTC\", \"vSphereEvent.host\": \"192.168.0.230\", \"vSphereEvent.userName\": \"dcui\" Copy Collect snapshots data (Beta) To collect snapshot data, use the ENABLE_VSPHERE_SNAPSHOTS environment variable. Snapshot data can be found in VSphereSnapshotVmSample. Collected data covers total and unique space occupied by disk and memory files, snapshot tree, and creation time. You can use this information to create NRQL queries, dashboards, and alerts, since it's linked to the corresponding virtual machine entity. Collect vSphere tags (Beta) To collect vSphere tags, use the ENABLE_VSPHERE_TAGS environment variable. Tags are available as attributes in the corresponding entity sample as label.tagCategory:tagName. If two tags of the same category are assigned to a resource, they are added to a unique attribute separated by a pipe character. For example: label.tagCategory:tagName|tagName2. Tags can be used to run NRQL queries, filter entities in the New Relic Explorer, and to create dashboards and alerts. Filter resources by tags (Beta) Resource filtering allows you to specify which resources you want to monitor by declaring a set of tags that resources must have in order to be monitored. Resources require a match on any (one or more) of the filter tags in order to be included. If none of the resource tags match any of the filter tags, no information about that resource is sent to New Relic. To use filtering resources by tag you need to have the ENABLE_VSPHERE_TAGS environment variable enabled. A tag filter expression is a space-separated list of pairs of strings with the format category=name. For example, to only retrieve resources with a tag category region and include regions us and eu use a filter expression like: region=us region=eu INCLUDE_TAGS: > region=us region=eu Copy To enable resource filtering by tag, edit your integration configuration file and add the option INCLUDE_TAGS with the filter expression you want. Caution Note that datacenter resources acting as the root of the resource tree MUST have tags attached AND match the filter expression in order for other child resources to be fetched. Important If you connect the integration directly to the ESXi host, vCenter data is not available (for example, events, tags, or datacenter metadata). Example configuration Here are examples of the vSphere integration configuration, including performance metrics: vsphere-config.yml.sample (Linux) vsphere-win-config.yml.sample (Windows) vsphere-performance.metrics (Performance metrics) For more information, see our documentation about the general structure of on-host integration configurations. Important The configuration option inventory_source is not compatible with this integration. Update your integration On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. View and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. vSphere data is attached to these event types: VSphereHostSample VSphereClusterSample VSphereVmSample VSphereDatastoreSample VSphereDatacenterSample VSphereResourcePoolSample VSphereSnapshotVmSample Performance data is enabled and configured separately (see Enable and configure performance metrics). For more on how to view and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The vSphere integration provides metric data attached to the following New Relic events: VSphereHost VSphereVm VSphereDatastore VSphereDatacenter VSphereResourcePool VSphereCluster VSphereSnapshotVm VSphereHost Name Description cpu.totalMHz Sum of the MHz for all the individual cores on the host cpu.coreMHz Speed of the CPU cores cpu.available Amount of free CPU MHz in the host cpu.overallUsage CPU usage across all cores on the host in MHz cpu.percent Percentage of CPU utilization in the host cpu.cores Number of physical CPU cores on the host. Physical CPU cores are the processors contained by a CPU package cpu.threads Number of physical CPU threads on the host disk.totalMiB Total capacity of disks mounted in host, in MiB mem.free Amount of available memory in the host, in MiB mem.usage Amount of used memory in the host, in MiB mem.size Total memory capacity of the host, in MiB vmCount Number of virtual machines in the host hypervisorHostname Name of the host uuid The hardware BIOS identification datacenterName Name of the datacenter related to the host clusterName Name of the cluster related to the host resourcePoolNameList List of names of the resource pools related to the host datastoreNameList List of names of datastores related to the host datacenterLocation Datacenter location networkNameList List of names of networks related to the host overallStatus gray: Status is unknown green: Entity is OK yellow: Entity might have a problem red: Entity definitely has a problem connectionState The host connection state: connected: Connected to the server. For ESX Server, this is the default setting. disconnected: The user has explicitly taken the host down. VirtualCenter does not expect to receive heartbeats from the host. The next time a heartbeat is received, the host is moved to the connected state again and an event is logged. notResponding: VirtualCenter is not receiving heartbeats from the server. The state automatically changes to connected once heartbeats are received again. This state is typically used to trigger an alarm on the host. inMaintenanceMode The flag to indicate whether or not the host is in maintenance mode. This flag is set when the host has entered the maintenance mode. It is not set during the entering phase of maintenance mode. inQuarantineMode The flag to indicate whether or not the host is in quarantine mode. InfraUpdateHa will recommend to set this flag based on the HealthUpdates received by the HealthUpdateProviders configured for the cluster. A host that is reported as degraded will be recommended to enter quarantine mode, while a host that is reported as healthy will be recommended to exit quarantine mode. Execution of these recommended actions will set this flag. Hosts in quarantine mode will be avoided by vSphere DRS as long as the increased consolidation in the cluster does not negatively affect VM performance. powerState The host power state: poweredOff: The host was specifically powered off by the user through VirtualCenter. This state is not a cetain state, because after VirtualCenter issues the command to power off the host, the host might crash, or kill all the processes but fail to power off. poweredOn: The host is powered on. A host that is entering standby mode entering is also in this state. standBy: The host was specifically put in standby mode, either explicitly by the user or automatically by DPM. This state is not a certain state, because after VirtualCenter issues the command to put the host in standby state, the host might crash, or kill all the processes but fail to power off. A host that is exiting standby mode s also in this state. unknown: If the host is disconnected or notResponding, we know its power state, so the host is marked as unknown. standbyMode The host’s standby mode. The property is only populated by vCenter server. If queried directly from the ESX host, the property is unset. entering: The host is entering standby mode. exiting: The host is exiting standby mode. in: The host is in standby mode. none: The host is not in standby mode, and it is not in the process of entering or exiting standby mode. cryptoState Encryption state of the host. Valid values are enumerated by the CryptoState type: incapable: The host is not safe for receiving sensitive material. prepared: The host is prepared for receiving sensitive material but does not have a host key set yet. safe: The host is crypto safe and has a host key set. bootTime The time when the host was booted.

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss.

Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern. Useful if using a wildcard query exclude_regex: # This will match any bean where the name is YoungGen - name=YoungGen attributes: - attr: LastGcInfo.GcThreadCount metric_type: gauge metric_name: GCThreadCount # Domains can be wildcarded - domain: java.util.* # If the domain is wildcarded, a custom event must be defined event_type: JavaUtilSample beans: # If no attributes are defined, all are collected by default - query: type=Logging Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern.

Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern. Useful if using a wildcard query exclude_regex: # This will match any bean where the name is YoungGen - name=YoungGen attributes: - attr: LastGcInfo.GcThreadCount metric_type: gauge metric_name: GCThreadCount # Domains can be wildcarded - domain: java.util.* # If the domain is wildcarded, a custom event must be defined event_type: JavaUtilSample beans: # If no attributes are defined, all are collected by default - query: type=Logging Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern.

Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports only x86 processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit architecture (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible linux operating sytems. Built-in log forwarding and on-host integrations are not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems: Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). Important Operating systems are not supported beyond manufacturer end-of-life. Tip You can monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Important Servers named localhost are not reported: it's a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Microsoft SQL Server integration links.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports only x86 processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit architecture (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible linux operating sytems. Built-in log forwarding and on-host integrations are not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems: Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). Important Operating systems are not supported beyond manufacturer end-of-life. Tip You can monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Important Servers named localhost are not reported: it's a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Microsoft SQL Server integration links.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports only x86 processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit architecture (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible linux operating sytems. Built-in log forwarding and on-host integrations are not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems: Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). Important Operating systems are not supported beyond manufacturer end-of-life. Tip You can monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Important Servers named localhost are not reported: it's a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Microsoft SQL Server integration links.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports only x86 processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit architecture (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible linux operating sytems. Built-in log forwarding and on-host integrations are not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems: Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). Important Operating systems are not supported beyond manufacturer end-of-life. Tip You can monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Important Servers named localhost are not reported: it's a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

      "body": "Our F5 BIG-IP integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your F5 BIG-IP instance to our platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. We collect data at the system, application, pool, pool member, virtual server, and node levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with F5 BIG-IP 11.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with the infrastructure agent. F5 BIG-IP user account with Access Auditor-level user privileges and iControl REST API access permissions. F5 BIG-IP users and privileges To create a new user and assign user permissions: Create a user account with, at minimum, Access Auditor-level permissions. For instructions, see the F5 official documentation. Once the user has been created, assign the user iControl REST user permissions. Tip Administrator-level permissions may be required to collect some system sample metrics or system inventory configuration data. For more information on user permission levels, see User role access descriptions. Tip For detailed information on iControl users and permission, download and review the iControl REST User Guide. Install and activate To install the F5 BIG-IP integration, choose your setup: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-f5. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp f5-config.yml.sample f5-config.yml Copy Edit the f5-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-f5 MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-f5/nri-f5-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-f5-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy f5-config.yml.sample f5-config.yml Copy Edit the f5-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: We recommend you install the integration on a separate server and monitor F5 remotely. Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example of the configuration file, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The f5-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metrics for the BIG-IP instance. inventory: collects only the inventory (configuration) data for the BIG-IP instance. metrics: collects only the metrics data for the BIG-IP instance. Arguments The f5-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: username: The username for the F5 BIG-IP connection. This field is required. password: The password for the F5 BIG-IP connection. This field is required. hostname: The hostname for the F5 BIG-IP connection. Default: f5-host. port: The port on which F5 BIG-IP instance is running. Default: 443. timeout: The number of seconds to wait before a request times out. Default: 30. ca_bundle_file: Alternative certificate authority bundle file. ca_bundle_dir: Alternative certificate authority bundle directory. partition_filter: An array of the partitions to collect from, in JSON. Default: '[\"Common\"]'. Example configuration Example f5-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration integration_name: com.newrelic.f5 instances: - name: nri-f5 # command can be all_data, metrics, or inventory command: all_data arguments: # Username of the F5 instance username: admin # Password of the F5 instance password: admin # Hostname of the F5 instance hostname: f5-host # Port of the F5 instance port: 443 # CA certificate file ca_bundle_file: /etc/ca_certificate.crt # A JSON array of BIG-IP partitions to collect from. # The partition name should have no leading slash. # Defaults to '[\"Common\"]' partition_filter: '[\"Common\",\"MyOtherPartition\"]' # The number of seconds to wait before a request times out # Defaults to 30 timeout: 10 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "In order to report request queuing, New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). These examples use the X-Request-Start header, since it is has broader support across platforms. If this does not work with your server configuration for request queuing, try using the X-Queue-Start header. The syntax should otherwise be the same. Apache Apache's mod_headers module includes a %t variable that is formatted correctly. To enable request queue reporting, add this code to your Apache config: RequestHeader set X-Request-Start \"%t\" Copy Nginx If you are using Nginx version 1.2.6 or higher and the latest version of the Ruby, Python, or PHP agent, Nginx can easily be configured to report queue time. (For Nginx versions 1.2.6 or lower, you must recompile Nginx with a module or patch.) Configuring with Nginx 1.2.6 or higher uses the ${msec} variable, which is a number in seconds with milliseconds resolution. For more information, see http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#variables. Add the appropriate information to your Nginx config: Nginx configuration Values General Nginx use proxy_set_header X-Request-Start \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Passenger Version 5 or higher: >passenger_set_header X-REQUEST-START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Older versions: passenger_set_cgi_param X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy fastcgi fastcgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy uWSGI uwsgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy F5 load balancers For F5 load balancers, use this configuration snippet: when HTTP_REQUEST_SEND { # TCL 8.4 so we have to calculate the time in millisecond resolution # Calculation from: https://groups.google.com/forum/? fromgroups=#!topic/comp.lang.tcl/tV9H6TDv0t8 set secs [clock seconds] set ms [clock clicks -milliseconds] set base [expr { $secs * 1000 }] set fract [expr { $ms - $base }] if { $fract >= 1000 } { set diff [expr { $fract / 1000 }] incr secs $diff incr fract [expr { -1000 * $diff }] } set micros [format \"%d%03d000\" $secs $fract] # Want this header inserted as if coming from the client clientside { HTTP::header insert X-Request-Start \"t=${micros}\" } } Copy Network timing Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time in your Browser data. This is because the front-end server does not add the queuing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. The queuing time headers can never account for backlog in the listener socket used to accept requests. For example, if the front-end server's configuration results in a backlog of requests that queue in the listener socket, page load timing will show an increase in network time.",

Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click the Guided install button. If your account reports data through our EU datacenter, click EU Guided install. Guided install EU Guided install Our infrastructure agent discovers the applications and infrastructure and log sources running in your environment, and recommends which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Supported APM agents If you have a .NET Windows application on IIS, the guided install configures and enables an APM agent. Guided install for .NET EU Guided install for .NET Why it matters With our guided install, you can instrument your applications and infrastructure and start seeing your data in New Relic in minutes. The guided install uses our command line interface (CLI), the infrastructure agent for your host environment, and a library of installation recipes to instrument your applications and infrastructure for you. That means less toil for you. Because our instrumentation recipes are open source, you can modify existing recipes, or build new ones, to suit your needs. Some technical detail The New Relic guided install uses open source installation recipes to instrument on-host integrations. These recipes include installation and setup commands, information about logs, and metadata related to what’s being installed. They're collected in a YAML file for each type of system and have all of the installation details necessary to install the infrastructure agent for a specific integration. Important On Windows, our guided install only supports Microsoft SQL Server, logs, and the infrastructure agent. All other integrations are only supported on Linux. On-host integration (OHI) recipes The guided install automates the discovery, configuration, and installation of OHIs. However, there may be times when you want to instrument them one-by-one using the CLI install command. To install any individual on-host integration, run this command: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=API_KEY NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=ACCOUNT_ID /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n INTEGRATION-FLAG Copy For example: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=<API_KEY> NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID> /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n apache-open-source-integration Copy The table lists the integrations supported by the guided install CLI command. The specific on-host integration commands are provided for your reference. Our open source integrations send performance metrics and inventory data from your servers and applications to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts.

MySQL: Incorrect user permissions To monitor MySQL health data, you need a valid username and password with specific permissions. These commands will create a user and grant the required permissions: Create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD';\" Copy Give replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Give select privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Once done, your next guided install attempt should work. NGINX: No status URL To monitor your NGINX server, you'll need to configure a valid status URL. status_url: The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. If the default value of 127.0.0.1 is incorrect, substitute the address/FQDN/URL for your system. Example: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status You can read more about the status_url in these NGINX docs: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module There are different ways to set status_url, depending on how NGINX was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: See Monitor services running on Kubernetes.

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Open one.newrelic.com, and go to explorer. Using the filter bar at the top, narrow your searches: Limit results to OpenTelemetry entities with the following: After the OpenTelemetry filter, you can add another filter for your service based on the service.name attributes you've used. For example, to find CartService: Click the service you want to know more about, and if you need help understanding the data, see the explanations below. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed Tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in the response time of your application. From the transaction summary page, you can get a list of transactions by selecting See transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals captures calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On this page, you can see total errors, as well as charts showing error count and error rate.

      "body": "OpenTelemetry is a flexible toolkit that you can implement in a variety of ways. We recommend a basic four-step approach for setting up OpenTelemetry with New Relic. Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Send your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI In the following sections, we explain some basic architectural approaches, but if you want to explore other implementation options, check out OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Make sure you have an Insights insert key to send spans and metrics to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Tip We recommend that you instrument as many services as possible to get the most benefit from distributed tracing. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete the next step of sending your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Send your telemetry data to New Relic Choose how you want to export your telemetry data to New Relic: Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) Both approaches involve configuring your service with an OTLP exporter to send data over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). To do so, follow the documentation of the OTLP exporter for your service's language: C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider signing up for the pre-release of New Relic's native OTLP endpoint. If you are interested in tracing, there are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. The diagram below shows the flow of data with the collector. To use the collector: Configure your OpenTelemetry collector to export data to New Relic, using our example as a guide. Important The New Relic exporter for the collector will be deprecated in the future. If you are running your own collector, you will instead be able to use the OpenTelemetry Collector's OTLP exporter When we release our native OTLP endpoint (pre-release), th If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider using the OTLP exporter for your language and send data directly to New Relic's native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. You can configure your service's OTLP exporter to send data directly to New Relic. If you're running your own OpenTelemetry collector, you can use the OTLP exporter for the collector to send data to New Relic. Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, you can go to New Relic and view your data. The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options, see View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic.",

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute.

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern.

Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used.

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss.

Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user.

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used.

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Quick start Instrument your JMX-enabled application quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the JMX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your JMX-enabled application. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files This is where the host connection and collection file information is defined. This configuration accepts the following arguments. For an example, see Host connection file example. collection_files: A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. Connection arguments: jmx_host: the host JMX is running on. Default: localhost. jmx_pass: the password for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". jmx_port: the port JMX is running on. Default: 9999. jmx_remote: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format, connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. Default: false. jmx_remote_jboss_standlone: (JBoss specific) whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format, only relevant if jmx_remote is set. Default: false. connection_url:: full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" . jmx_user: the username for the JMX connection. Default: \"\". key_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. key_store_password: the password for the SSL key store. local_entity: collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. Default: false. timeout: the timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. trust_store: the filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. trust_store_password: the password for the trust store. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integration_name: com.newrelic.jmx instances: - name: jmx command: all_data arguments: jmx_host: jmx-host.localnet jmx_port: 9999 jmx_user: admin jmx_pass: admin collection_files: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern.

Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Microsoft SQL Server integration links. Microsoft SQL Server data is attached to the following event types: MssqlDatabaseSample MssqlInstanceSample MssqlWaitSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Microsoft SQL Server integration collects the following metric data attributes. Some metric name are prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as asserts. or flush..

      "body": "From a New Relic perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything New Relic can identify that has data you can monitor. Integrations can be configured to create their own entity, called a remote entity, by setting the remote_monitoring option to true. If set to false, an integration will be considered a local entity, and the data related to it will be attached to the host entity that the agent creates. Remote monitoring requires infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher. For the Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, and Redis integrations, remote monitoring (and multi-tenancy) is enabled by activating the configuration parameter remote_monitoring. Important If your Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, or Redis service is located in the same host as the agent, when you activate remote monitoring the resulting entity will be considered as remote, regardless of its actual location. This may affect alerts, alter attributes, and have other effects, as explained here. Effects of activating remote_monitoring By enabling remote_monitoring, the integration becomes a different entity which is no longer attached to the infrastructure agent. As a result, the following items may be affected: Alert verification Enabling remote monitoring can affect your configured alerts in case they are using any of the values that are affected by this new feature. We strongly recommend checking your existing alerts to make sure they keep on working as expected. New entity attributes These attributes are modified in the resulting entity: Display name: New entity unique key (instead of using the display name) Entity GUID: New entity GUID Entity ID: New entity ID Entity key: New entity unique key (instead of using the display name) External key: Using integration entity name (instead of using the agent display) Changes in recorded metrics When remote monitoring is enabled, we will add the hostname and port values to all metrics. If the nricluster name or nriservice are defined in the integration configuration file, they will also be decorated. Unrecorded attributes Since the integration is now an independent entity which is not attached to the agent, the following agent attributes are not collected: agentName agentVersion coreCount criticalViolationCount fullHostname instanceType kernelVersion linuxDistribution entityType operatingSystem processorCount systemMemoryBytes warningViolationCount Your custom attributes Updated hostname For the ApacheSample, RedisSample, CassandraSample, and NginxSample integration metrics, we will use the integration configuration hostname instead of the short hostname from the agent.

Use the predefined alert types and thresholds The Kubernetes integration comes with its own alert policy and alert conditions. To see what the predefined alert conditions are, see Kubernetes integration: Predefined alert policy. In addition, you can create an alert condition for any metric collected by any New Relic integration you use, including the Kubernetes integration: Select the alert type Integrations. From the Select a data source dropdown, select a Kubernetes (K8s) data source. Select alert notifications When an alert condition's threshold is triggered, New Relic sends a message to the notification channel(s) chosen in the alert policy. Depending on the type of notification, you may have the following options: View the incident. Acknowledge the incident. Go to a chart of the incident data by selecting the identifier name. The entity identifier that triggered the alert appears near the top of the notification message. The format of the identifier depends on the alert type: Available pods are less than desired pods alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:replicaset:REPLICASET_NAME Copy CPU or memory usage alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:POD_NAME:container:CONTAINER_NAME Copy Here are some examples. Pod alert notification example For Available pods are less than desired pods alerts, the ID of the ReplicaSet triggering the issue might look like this: k8s:beam-production:default:replicaset:nginx-deployment-1623441481 Copy This identifier contains the following information: Cluster name: beam-production Parent namespace: default ReplicaSet name: nginx-deployment-1623441481 Container resource notification example For container CPU or memory usage alerts, the entity might look like this: k8s:beam-production:kube-system:kube-state-metrics-797bb87c75-zncwn:container:kube-state-metrics Copy This identifier contains the following information: Cluster name: beam-production Parent namespace: kube-system Pod namespace: kube-state-metrics-797bb87c75-zncwn Container name: kube-state-metrics Create alert conditions using NRQL Follow standard procedures to create alert conditions for NRQL queries.

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

Data collection and reporting process This is how an infrastructure on-host integration sends data to New Relic: On startup, the infrastructure agent scans the directory that contains the integration's definition files. The infrastructure agent registers every integration executable defined in the definition file. The agent scans a dedicated directory for integration configuration files. If those config files specify integrations that have been registered with the infrastructure agent, the agent sets up and schedules the integrations. At the scheduled interval (the default is 15 seconds), the agent harvests the data from the integration and prepares it for transmission. Every 60 seconds, it sends that data to New Relic, along with any other infrastructure data. After a successful collection pass, the integration executable exits. File structure and specifications Understanding the file structure of New Relic on-host integrations can help you customize your integration, understand and use your data, and troubleshoot problems. On-host integrations adhere to a set of open source specifications, allowing anyone to build their own infrastructure on-host integration.

Our integration collects Kubernetes data by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. For a simpler and more visual experience, use the cluster explorer. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can query your Kubernetes data and create clear visualizations. Query Kubernetes data The simplest way to query your Kubernetes data is using the query builder, which accepts NRQL queries in its advanced mode. Alternatively, you can use the NerdGraph API to retrieve Kubernetes data.

To filter the alert to Kubernetes entities that only have the chosen attributes, select Filter. Select the threshold settings. For more on the Trigger an alert when... options, see Alert types. Select an existing alert policy, or create a new one. Select Create. When an alert condition's threshold is triggered, New Relic sends a notification to the policy's notification channels. Use the predefined alert types and thresholds The Kubernetes integration comes with its own alert policy and alert conditions. To see what the predefined alert conditions are, see Kubernetes integration: Predefined alert policy. In addition, you can create an alert condition for any metric collected by any New Relic integration you use, including the Kubernetes integration: Select the alert type Integrations. From the Select a data source dropdown, select a Kubernetes (K8s) data source. Select alert notifications When an alert condition's threshold is triggered, New Relic sends a message to the notification channel(s) chosen in the alert policy. Depending on the type of notification, you may have the following options: View the incident. Acknowledge the incident. Go to a chart of the incident data by selecting the identifier name. The entity identifier that triggered the alert appears near the top of the notification message. The format of the identifier depends on the alert type: Available pods are less than desired pods alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:replicaset:REPLICASET_NAME Copy CPU or memory usage alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:POD_NAME:container:CONTAINER_NAME Copy Here are some examples. Pod alert notification example For Available pods are less than desired pods alerts, the ID of the ReplicaSet triggering the issue might look like this: k8s:beam-production:default:replicaset:nginx-deployment-1623441481 Copy This identifier contains the following information: Cluster name: beam-production Parent namespace: default ReplicaSet name: nginx-deployment-1623441481 Container resource notification example For container CPU or memory usage alerts, the entity might look like this: k8s:beam-production:kube-system:kube-state-metrics-797bb87c75-zncwn:container:kube-state-metrics Copy This identifier contains the following information: Cluster name: beam-production Parent namespace: kube-system Pod namespace: kube-state-metrics-797bb87c75-zncwn Container name: kube-state-metrics Create alert conditions using NRQL Follow standard procedures to create alert conditions for NRQL queries.

      "body": "Our cloud integrations get data from cloud provider APIs. In New Relic, you can change some of the data collection-related settings for your cloud integrations. Read on to see what changes you can make and the reasons for making them. Tip To use integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Overview of settings New Relic cloud integrations get data from cloud providers' APIs. Data is generally collected from monitoring APIs such as AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and GCP Stackdriver, and inventory metadata is collected from the specific services' APIs. You can use the account status dashboard to see how your cloud integrations are handling data from a cloud service provider. If you want to report more or less data from your cloud integrations, or if you need to control the use of the cloud providers' APIs to prevent reaching rate and throttling limits in your cloud account, you can change the configuration settings to modify the amount of data they report. The two main controls are: Change polling frequency Change what data is reported Examples of business reasons for wanting to change your polling frequency include: Billing: If you need to manage your AWS CloudWatch bill, you may want to decrease the polling frequency. Before you do this, make sure that any alert conditions set for your cloud integrations are not affected by this reduction. New services: If you are deploying a new service or configuration and you want to collect data more often, you may want to increase the polling frequency temporarily. Caution Changing the configuration settings for your integrations may impact alert conditions and chart trends. Change polling frequency The polling frequency configuration determines how often New Relic reports data from your cloud provider for each service. By default, the polling frequency is set to the maximum frequency that is available for each service. To change the polling frequency for a cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Use the dropdowns next to Data polling interval every to select how frequently you want New Relic to capture your cloud integration data. Specify data to be fetched You can specify which information you want captured for your cloud integration by enabling the collection of additional data and by applying multiple filters to each integration. To change this settings for your cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Under Data collections and filters, turn the toggles you want On. For filters, select or enter the values that you want included in your reported data. Data collection For some cloud integrations, an additional number of calls to the cloud provider APIs are needed in order to collect data. For example, to fetch tags for AWS Elastic Map Reduce clusters, an additional call to the service API is required. Therefore, in order to better control the amount of API calls that are sent to your cloud account for these integrations, New Relic allows you to specify if you need these data to be collected. There are different data collection toggles available, depending on the integration. Toggle Description Collect tags Some integrations require additional API calls to the cloud provider to report tags. Tag collection is enabled by default. Switch this to Off if you don't want the integration to collect your cloud resource tags and thus reduce the volume of API calls. Collect extended inventory Some integrations can collect extended inventory metadata about your cloud resources by making additional API calls to the cloud provider. The metadata that is included within extended inventory for each cloud integration is described in the integration documentation. Extended inventory collection is disabled by default. Switch this to On if you want to monitor extended inventory. This will increase the volume of API calls. Collect shards data Available for AWS Kinesis Streams integration. By default, New Relic does not report shard metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor shard metrics in addition to data stream metrics. Collect Lambda@Edge data Available for AWS CloudFront integration. By default, New Relic does not report Lambda@Edge data. Switch this to On if you're using Lambda@Edge in AWS CloudFront and want to get Lambda execution location metadata. Collect nodes data Available for AWS Elasticsearch integration. By default, New Relic does not report Elasticsearch node metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor node metrics in addition to cluster metrics. Collect NAT Gateway data and Collect VPN data Available for AWS VPC integration. By default, New Relic does not report NAT Gateway nor VPN metrics. Switch these to On if you want to monitor NAT Gateway and VPN metrics and inventory, in addition to other VPC related entities inventory. Collect IP addresses Available for AWS EC2 integration. By default, New Relic collects EC2 instance metadata that includes public and private IP addresses, and network interface details. Switch this to Off if you don't want New Relic to store and display these IP data. Filters When a filter is On, you specify the data that you want to be collected; for example, if the Limit to AWS region is On, the regions that you select will be the ones that data will be collected for. There are different filters available, depending on the integration: Filter Description Region Select the regions that include the resources that you want to monitor. Queue prefixes Available for AWS SQS integration. Enter each name or prefix for the queues that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Load balancer prefixes Available for AWS ALB integration. Enter each name or prefix for the application load balancers that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Stage name prefixes Available for AWS API Gateway integration. Enter each name or prefix for the stages that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Tag key Enter one tag key that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag value filter. Tag value Enter one tag value that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag key. Resource group Select the resource groups that are associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Potential impact on alerts and charts If you change an integration's configuration, it can impact alert conditions and charts. Here are some things to consider: If you change this setting... It may have this impact... Any configuration setting When you change the configuration settings, the data that New Relic displays in infrastructure charts, on the inventory page, and in the events feed changes as well. Any filters When you create alert conditions after you set filters, make sure that your alerts are not triggered by resources that you filtered out. Filter for regions If you filter for specific regions, it may lower the amount of data reported to New Relic, which could trigger an alert. If you create an alert condition for a specific region and then filter that region out, the region would no longer report data and would never trigger the alert. Polling frequency When you create an alert, make sure that you define the threshold for a time period that is longer than the polling frequency. Tags and extended inventory If you turn on tags and/or extended inventory, New Relic makes more API calls to the cloud provider, which could increase your cloud provider API usage bill.",

The following tips and sample queries were created for New Relic-built integrations, but most will also apply to integrations built with the Integrations SDK. For a general look at how to find and use integration data, see Understand integration data. Get started with integration data Here are some tips for finding and exploring your integration data in New Relic: From the one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services page, select an integration dashboard. There, you can view the NRQL queries that generated a chart. For examples of NRQL queries for integration data, see the example queries.

Example NRQL queries Here are some examples of NRQL queries that use integration data: AWS EBS query example Here's a NRQL query for the AWS EBS service, showing the total write time metric, faceted by entityName: SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') FROM BlockDeviceSample WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Azure Service Bus query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for the maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic queue, faceted by resource group: SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample FACET resourceGroupName Copy Azure Functions query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for Azure Functions, showing the count of executed functions over the past six hours by region over time: SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for Azure VMs that compares the count of VM events over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago: SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample FACET name SINCE 30 minutes ago COMPARE WITH 1 week ago Copy NGINX query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your NGINX integration data and place in an Insights dashboard. This query creates a chart showing the average value of NGINX requests per second over time: SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) FROM NginxSample TIMESERIES Copy For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. MySQL query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your MySQL integration data. This query generates a chart showing the maximum number of used MySQL connections: SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) FROM MysqlSample Copy For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. Inventory change query example Here's an example of a query that groups inventory change events from the last day by the type of change: SELECT count(*) FROM InfrastructureEvent WHERE format='inventoryChange' FACET changeType SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy Tip You can also perform these queries using dimensional metrics. Tips for using different data types Integrations can generate metric, event, and inventory data, all of which are available for querying in New Relic Insights. Here are some tips for using the different types of integration data in Insights: Metric data tips Tips for finding and using integration metric data in Insights: All integration data is attached to a data type known as an event (not to be confused with events reported by integrations, which represent important activity in your host/service). This means that all integration data can be found via the data explorer. For more about these two basic New Relic data types, see New Relic data collection. Metric values are treated as attributes: key-value pairs attached to an event. For example, the MySQL integration has an 'active connections' metric; this would be found by querying the connectionsActive attribute of the MysqlSample event. For general information about metrics, see Integration metric data. Event data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration event data in Insights: Most integration events are inventory change events. When inventory is changed, it generates an InfrastructureEvent with a format value of inventoryChange. Integration data can be found via the data explorer. For general information about events, see Integration event data. Inventory data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration inventory data in Insights: For general information about inventory data, see Integration inventory data. Some inventory data is added as attributes (key-value pairs) to Insights data. For example, the AWS EC2 integration collects awsRegion as inventory data; this would be found in Insights by querying the awsRegion attribute of the ComputeSample event type and provider Ec2Instance. When inventory data changes, an Insights InfrastructureEvent event type is generated with a format value of inventoryChange. See the query examples for an example of querying this data. For more on using NRQL queries, see Intro to NRQL.",

Tip This list isn't complete. We're currently reviewing the full list of metrics that can cause data gaps. Cause Some metrics aren’t present in the usual cloud provider APIs (CloudWatch, Stackdriver, Azure Monitor) and are fetched from the service APIs instead. Each cloud service provider has a unique service API that processes data and interacts with the service. For example, if a metric isn’t present in AWS CloudWatch, New Relic will fetch the metric from the AWS ECS service API.",

When you create a useful query you'd like to add to your Insights dashboard, select Add to dashboard. Example NRQL queries Here are some examples of NRQL queries that use integration data: AWS EBS query example Here's a NRQL query for the AWS EBS service, showing the total write time metric, faceted by entityName: SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') FROM BlockDeviceSample WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Azure Service Bus query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for the maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic queue, faceted by resource group: SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample FACET resourceGroupName Copy Azure Functions query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for Azure Functions, showing the count of executed functions over the past six hours by region over time: SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for Azure VMs that compares the count of VM events over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago: SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample FACET name SINCE 30 minutes ago COMPARE WITH 1 week ago Copy NGINX query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your NGINX integration data and place in an Insights dashboard. This query creates a chart showing the average value of NGINX requests per second over time: SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) FROM NginxSample TIMESERIES Copy For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. MySQL query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your MySQL integration data. This query generates a chart showing the maximum number of used MySQL connections: SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) FROM MysqlSample Copy For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. Inventory change query example Here's an example of a query that groups inventory change events from the last day by the type of change: SELECT count(*) FROM InfrastructureEvent WHERE format='inventoryChange' FACET changeType SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy Tip You can also perform these queries using dimensional metrics. Tips for using different data types Integrations can generate metric, event, and inventory data, all of which are available for querying in New Relic Insights. Here are some tips for using the different types of integration data in Insights: Metric data tips Tips for finding and using integration metric data in Insights: All integration data is attached to a data type known as an event (not to be confused with events reported by integrations, which represent important activity in your host/service). This means that all integration data can be found via the data explorer. For more about these two basic New Relic data types, see New Relic data collection. Metric values are treated as attributes: key-value pairs attached to an event. For example, the MySQL integration has an 'active connections' metric; this would be found by querying the connectionsActive attribute of the MysqlSample event. For general information about metrics, see Integration metric data. Event data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration event data in Insights: Most integration events are inventory change events. When inventory is changed, it generates an InfrastructureEvent with a format value of inventoryChange. Integration data can be found via the data explorer. For general information about events, see Integration event data. Inventory data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration inventory data in Insights: For general information about inventory data, see Integration inventory data. Some inventory data is added as attributes (key-value pairs) to Insights data. For example, the AWS EC2 integration collects awsRegion as inventory data; this would be found in Insights by querying the awsRegion attribute of the ComputeSample event type and provider Ec2Instance. When inventory data changes, an Insights InfrastructureEvent event type is generated with a format value of inventoryChange. See the query examples for an example of querying this data.

      "body": "Our cloud integrations get data from cloud provider APIs. In New Relic, you can change some of the data collection-related settings for your cloud integrations. Read on to see what changes you can make and the reasons for making them. Tip To use integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Overview of settings New Relic cloud integrations get data from cloud providers' APIs. Data is generally collected from monitoring APIs such as AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and GCP Stackdriver, and inventory metadata is collected from the specific services' APIs. You can use the account status dashboard to see how your cloud integrations are handling data from a cloud service provider. If you want to report more or less data from your cloud integrations, or if you need to control the use of the cloud providers' APIs to prevent reaching rate and throttling limits in your cloud account, you can change the configuration settings to modify the amount of data they report. The two main controls are: Change polling frequency Change what data is reported Examples of business reasons for wanting to change your polling frequency include: Billing: If you need to manage your AWS CloudWatch bill, you may want to decrease the polling frequency. Before you do this, make sure that any alert conditions set for your cloud integrations are not affected by this reduction. New services: If you are deploying a new service or configuration and you want to collect data more often, you may want to increase the polling frequency temporarily. Caution Changing the configuration settings for your integrations may impact alert conditions and chart trends. Change polling frequency The polling frequency configuration determines how often New Relic reports data from your cloud provider for each service. By default, the polling frequency is set to the maximum frequency that is available for each service. To change the polling frequency for a cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Use the dropdowns next to Data polling interval every to select how frequently you want New Relic to capture your cloud integration data. Specify data to be fetched You can specify which information you want captured for your cloud integration by enabling the collection of additional data and by applying multiple filters to each integration. To change this settings for your cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Under Data collections and filters, turn the toggles you want On. For filters, select or enter the values that you want included in your reported data. Data collection For some cloud integrations, an additional number of calls to the cloud provider APIs are needed in order to collect data. For example, to fetch tags for AWS Elastic Map Reduce clusters, an additional call to the service API is required. Therefore, in order to better control the amount of API calls that are sent to your cloud account for these integrations, New Relic allows you to specify if you need these data to be collected. There are different data collection toggles available, depending on the integration. Toggle Description Collect tags Some integrations require additional API calls to the cloud provider to report tags. Tag collection is enabled by default. Switch this to Off if you don't want the integration to collect your cloud resource tags and thus reduce the volume of API calls. Collect extended inventory Some integrations can collect extended inventory metadata about your cloud resources by making additional API calls to the cloud provider. The metadata that is included within extended inventory for each cloud integration is described in the integration documentation. Extended inventory collection is disabled by default. Switch this to On if you want to monitor extended inventory. This will increase the volume of API calls. Collect shards data Available for AWS Kinesis Streams integration. By default, New Relic does not report shard metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor shard metrics in addition to data stream metrics. Collect Lambda@Edge data Available for AWS CloudFront integration. By default, New Relic does not report Lambda@Edge data. Switch this to On if you're using Lambda@Edge in AWS CloudFront and want to get Lambda execution location metadata. Collect nodes data Available for AWS Elasticsearch integration. By default, New Relic does not report Elasticsearch node metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor node metrics in addition to cluster metrics. Collect NAT Gateway data and Collect VPN data Available for AWS VPC integration. By default, New Relic does not report NAT Gateway nor VPN metrics. Switch these to On if you want to monitor NAT Gateway and VPN metrics and inventory, in addition to other VPC related entities inventory. Collect IP addresses Available for AWS EC2 integration. By default, New Relic collects EC2 instance metadata that includes public and private IP addresses, and network interface details. Switch this to Off if you don't want New Relic to store and display these IP data. Filters When a filter is On, you specify the data that you want to be collected; for example, if the Limit to AWS region is On, the regions that you select will be the ones that data will be collected for. There are different filters available, depending on the integration: Filter Description Region Select the regions that include the resources that you want to monitor. Queue prefixes Available for AWS SQS integration. Enter each name or prefix for the queues that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Load balancer prefixes Available for AWS ALB integration. Enter each name or prefix for the application load balancers that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Stage name prefixes Available for AWS API Gateway integration. Enter each name or prefix for the stages that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Tag key Enter one tag key that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag value filter. Tag value Enter one tag value that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag key. Resource group Select the resource groups that are associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Potential impact on alerts and charts If you change an integration's configuration, it can impact alert conditions and charts. Here are some things to consider: If you change this setting... It may have this impact... Any configuration setting When you change the configuration settings, the data that New Relic displays in infrastructure charts, on the inventory page, and in the events feed changes as well. Any filters When you create alert conditions after you set filters, make sure that your alerts are not triggered by resources that you filtered out. Filter for regions If you filter for specific regions, it may lower the amount of data reported to New Relic, which could trigger an alert. If you create an alert condition for a specific region and then filter that region out, the region would no longer report data and would never trigger the alert. Polling frequency When you create an alert, make sure that you define the threshold for a time period that is longer than the polling frequency. Tags and extended inventory If you turn on tags and/or extended inventory, New Relic makes more API calls to the cloud provider, which could increase your cloud provider API usage bill.",

There, you can view the NRQL queries that generated a chart. For examples of NRQL queries for integration data, see the example queries. Use the data explorer or the dashboards to explore and understand the available data. Read the documentation for a specific integration to learn about the reported data. When you create a useful query you'd like to add to your Insights dashboard, select Add to dashboard. Example NRQL queries Here are some examples of NRQL queries that use integration data: AWS EBS query example Here's a NRQL query for the AWS EBS service, showing the total write time metric, faceted by entityName: SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') FROM BlockDeviceSample WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Azure Service Bus query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for the maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic queue, faceted by resource group: SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample FACET resourceGroupName Copy Azure Functions query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for Azure Functions, showing the count of executed functions over the past six hours by region over time: SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for Azure VMs that compares the count of VM events over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago: SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample FACET name SINCE 30 minutes ago COMPARE WITH 1 week ago Copy NGINX query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your NGINX integration data and place in an Insights dashboard. This query creates a chart showing the average value of NGINX requests per second over time: SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) FROM NginxSample TIMESERIES Copy For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. MySQL query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your MySQL integration data. This query generates a chart showing the maximum number of used MySQL connections: SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) FROM MysqlSample Copy For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. Inventory change query example Here's an example of a query that groups inventory change events from the last day by the type of change: SELECT count(*) FROM InfrastructureEvent WHERE format='inventoryChange' FACET changeType SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy Tip You can also perform these queries using dimensional metrics. Tips for using different data types Integrations can generate metric, event, and inventory data, all of which are available for querying in New Relic Insights. Here are some tips for using the different types of integration data in Insights: Metric data tips Tips for finding and using integration metric data in Insights: All integration data is attached to a data type known as an event (not to be confused with events reported by integrations, which represent important activity in your host/service). This means that all integration data can be found via the data explorer. For more about these two basic New Relic data types, see New Relic data collection. Metric values are treated as attributes: key-value pairs attached to an event. For example, the MySQL integration has an 'active connections' metric; this would be found by querying the connectionsActive attribute of the MysqlSample event. For general information about metrics, see Integration metric data. Event data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration event data in Insights: Most integration events are inventory change events. When inventory is changed, it generates an InfrastructureEvent with a format value of inventoryChange. Integration data can be found via the data explorer. For general information about events, see Integration event data. Inventory data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration inventory data in Insights: For general information about inventory data, see Integration inventory data. Some inventory data is added as attributes (key-value pairs) to Insights data. For example, the AWS EC2 integration collects awsRegion as inventory data; this would be found in Insights by querying the awsRegion attribute of the ComputeSample event type and provider Ec2Instance. When inventory data changes, an Insights InfrastructureEvent event type is generated with a format value of inventoryChange. See the query examples for an example of querying this data.

This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API To retrieve information about your New Relic partner account, sub-accounts, and users, use the Partner API. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API To query your data using NRQL-format queries, you can use the Query API. Note that this API is deprecated and NerdGraph is preferred for querying your data. Dashboard API See the Insights Dashboard API. Plugins Use the REST API for New Relic plugins and the API Explorer to: Get a list of plugins, including their names, IDs, and GUIDs. List one or more plugin components, their output, and their metric timeslice data. Developers and New Relic partners can also use New Relic's Plugin API to write an agent in any language that can work directly with the API for plugins. This allows you to send your own metric data to our plugins and view data received from the API in New Relic.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Example NRQL queries Here are some examples of NRQL queries that use integration data: AWS EBS query example Here's a NRQL query for the AWS EBS service, showing the total write time metric, faceted by entityName: SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') FROM BlockDeviceSample WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Azure Service Bus query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for the maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic queue, faceted by resource group: SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample FACET resourceGroupName Copy Azure Functions query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for Azure Functions, showing the count of executed functions over the past six hours by region over time: SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for Azure VMs that compares the count of VM events over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago: SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample FACET name SINCE 30 minutes ago COMPARE WITH 1 week ago Copy NGINX query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your NGINX integration data and place in an Insights dashboard. This query creates a chart showing the average value of NGINX requests per second over time: SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) FROM NginxSample TIMESERIES Copy For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. MySQL query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your MySQL integration data. This query generates a chart showing the maximum number of used MySQL connections: SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) FROM MysqlSample Copy For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. Inventory change query example Here's an example of a query that groups inventory change events from the last day by the type of change: SELECT count(*) FROM InfrastructureEvent WHERE format='inventoryChange' FACET changeType SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy Tip You can also perform these queries using dimensional metrics. Tips for using different data types Integrations can generate metric, event, and inventory data, all of which are available for querying in New Relic Insights. Here are some tips for using the different types of integration data in Insights: Metric data tips Tips for finding and using integration metric data in Insights: All integration data is attached to a data type known as an event (not to be confused with events reported by integrations, which represent important activity in your host/service). This means that all integration data can be found via the data explorer. For more about these two basic New Relic data types, see New Relic data collection. Metric values are treated as attributes: key-value pairs attached to an event. For example, the MySQL integration has an 'active connections' metric; this would be found by querying the connectionsActive attribute of the MysqlSample event. For general information about metrics, see Integration metric data. Event data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration event data in Insights: Most integration events are inventory change events. When inventory is changed, it generates an InfrastructureEvent with a format value of inventoryChange. Integration data can be found via the data explorer. For general information about events, see Integration event data. Inventory data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration inventory data in Insights: For general information about inventory data, see Integration inventory data. Some inventory data is added as attributes (key-value pairs) to Insights data. For example, the AWS EC2 integration collects awsRegion as inventory data; this would be found in Insights by querying the awsRegion attribute of the ComputeSample event type and provider Ec2Instance. When inventory data changes, an Insights InfrastructureEvent event type is generated with a format value of inventoryChange. See the query examples for an example of querying this data.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports only x86 processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit architecture (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible linux operating sytems. Built-in log forwarding and on-host integrations are not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems: Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). Important Operating systems are not supported beyond manufacturer end-of-life. Tip You can monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Important Servers named localhost are not reported: it's a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Retrieve data from New Relic. Send data to New Relic. Adjust settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our API endpoints. For developer-focused content on how to use and customize New Relic, see developer.newrelic.com. Tip To use APIs and SDKs, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL-format API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph is the preferred API for querying New Relic data and making a range of feature configurations. To get started, see Introduction to NerdGraph. REST APIs by capability New Relic capabilities, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, or alerts, are often used together, and sometimes they overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Tip To learn more about different API key types, see Understand New Relic API keys. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use the Query API. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The Browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the Browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To retrieve browser monitoring data, use the Query API. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To retrieve infrastructure data, use the Query API. This API can also be used to retrieve subscription usage data. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To retrieve Mobile data from New Relic, use the Query API. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To retrieve synthetics event data, use the Query API. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Telemetry APIs for core data types We offer several APIs that allow you to get our core data types (metrics, logs, traces, and events) into New Relic without the use of an installed agent. Data type Description Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic. Event API Send event data to New Relic. Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage You can use the Query API to retrieve subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API To retrieve information about your New Relic partner account, sub-accounts, and users, use the Partner API. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API To query your data using NRQL-format queries, you can use the Query API. Note that this API is deprecated and NerdGraph is preferred for querying your data. Dashboard API See the Insights Dashboard API. Plugins Use the REST API for New Relic plugins and the API Explorer to: Get a list of plugins, including their names, IDs, and GUIDs. List one or more plugin components, their output, and their metric timeslice data. Developers and New Relic partners can also use New Relic's Plugin API to write an agent in any language that can work directly with the API for plugins. This allows you to send your own metric data to our plugins and view data received from the API in New Relic.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems: Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). Important Operating systems are not supported beyond manufacturer end-of-life. Tip You can monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Important Servers named localhost are not reported: it's a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "You can surface Kubernetes metadata and link it to your APM agents as distributed traces to explore performance issues and troubleshoot transaction errors. For more information, see this New Relic blog post. You can quickly start monitoring Kubernetes clusters using Auto-telemetry with Pixie, which is currently a beta release. This Pixie integration into New Relic does not require a language agent. Learn more about Auto-telemetry with Pixie here. Tip Our Kubernetes metadata injection project is open source. Here's the code to link APM and infrastructure data and the code to automatically manage certificates. Compatibility and requirements Before linking Kubernetes metadata to your APM agents, make sure you meet the following requirements: Kubernetes requirements Network requirements APM agent compatibility OpenShift requirements Kubernetes requirements To link your applications and Kubernetes, your cluster must have the MutatingAdmissionWebhook controller enabled, which requires Kubernetes 1.9 or higher. To verify that your cluster is compatible, run the following command: kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 Copy If you see a different result, follow the Kubernetes documentation to enable admission control in your cluster. Network requirements For Kubernetes to speak to our MutatingAdmissionWebhook, the master node (or the API server container, depending on how the cluster is set up) should be allowed egress for HTTPS traffic on port 443 to pods in all of the other nodes in the cluster. This might require specific configuration depending on how the infrastructure is set up (on-premises, AWS, Google Cloud, etc). Tip Until Kubernetes v1.14, users were only allowed to register admission webhooks on port 443. Since v1.15 it's possible to register them on different ports. To ensure backward compatibility, the webhook is registered by default on port 443 in the YAML config file we distribute. APM agent compatibility The following New Relic agents collect Kubernetes metadata: Go 2.3.0 or higher Java 4.10.0 or higher Node.js 5.3.0 or higher Python 4.14.0 or higher Ruby 6.1.0 or higher .NET 8.17.438 or higher Openshift requirements To link Openshift and Kubernetes you must enable mutating admission webhooks, which requires Openshift 3.9 or higher. During the process, install a resource that requires admin permissions to the cluster. Run this to log in as admin: oc login -u system:admin Copy Check that webhooks are correctly configured. If they are not, update the master-config.yaml file. admissionConfig: pluginConfig: MutatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission ValidatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission location: \"\" Copy Important Add kubeConfigFile: /dev/null to address some issues in Openshift. Enable certificate signing by editing the YAML file and updating your configuration: kubernetesMasterConfig: controllerArguments: cluster-signing-cert-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.crt\" cluster-signing-key-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.key\" Copy Restart the Openshift services in the master node. Configure the injection of metadata By default, all the pods you create that include APM agents have the correct environment variables set and the metadata injection applies to the entire cluster. To check that the environment variables have been set, any container that is running must be stopped, and a new instance started (see Validate the injection of metadata). This default configuration also uses the Kubernetes certificates API to automatically manage the certificates required for the injection. If needed, you can limit the injection of metadata to specific namespaces in your cluster or self-manage your certificates. Default configuration To proceed with the default injection of metadata, follow these steps: Download the YAML file: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Custom configuration You can limit the injection of metadata only to specific namespaces by using labels. To enable this feature, edit your YAML file by finding and uncommenting the following lines: # namespaceSelector: # matchLabels: # newrelic-metadata-injection: enabled Copy With this option, injection is only applied to those namespaces that have the newrelic-metadata-injection label set to enabled: kubectl label namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE newrelic-metadata-injection=enabled Copy Manage custom certificates To use custom certificates you need a specific YAML file: Download the YAML file without automatic certificate management: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Once you have the correct YAML file, you can proceed with the custom certificate management option. You need your certificate, server key, and Certification Authority (CA) bundle encoded in PEM format. If you have them in the standard certificate format (X.509), install openssl, and run the following: openssl x509 -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out CERTIFICATE_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in SERVER_KEY_FILENAME -outform PEM -out SERVER_KEY_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in CA_BUNDLE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out BUNDLE_FILENAME.pem Copy If your certificate/key pair are in another format, see the Digicert knowledgebase for more help. Create the TLS secret with the signed certificate/key pair, and patch the mutating webhook configuration with the CA using the following commands: kubectl create secret tls newrelic-metadata-injection-secret \\ --key=PEM_ENCODED_SERVER_KEY \\ --cert=PEM_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE \\ --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl -n default apply -f - caBundle=$(cat PEM_ENCODED_CA_BUNDLE | base64 | td -d '\\n') kubectl patch mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg --type='json' -p \"[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle', 'value':'${caBundle}'}]\" Copy Important Certificates signed by Kubernetes have an expiration of one year. For more information, see the Kubernetes source code in GitHub. Validate the injection of metadata In order to validate that the webhook (responsible for injecting the metadata) was installed correctly, deploy a new pod and check for the New Relic environment variables. Create a dummy pod containing Busybox by running: kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Check if New Relic environment variables were injected: kubectl exec busybox0 -- env | grep NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME=fsi NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME=nodea NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME=default NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME=busybox0 NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME=busybox Copy Disable the injection of metadata To disable/uninstall the injection of metadata, use the following commands: Delete the Kubernetes objects using the yaml file: kubectl delete -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Delete the TLS secret containing the certificate/key pair: kubectl delete secret/newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Troubleshooting Follow these troubleshooting tips as needed. No Kubernetes metadata in APM or distributed tracing transactions Problem The creation of the secret by the k8s-webhook-cert-manager job used to fail due to the kubectl version used by the image when running in Kubernetes version 1.19.x, The new version 1.3.2 fixes this issue, therefore it is enough to run again the job using an update version of the image to fix the issue. Solution Update the image k8s-webhook-cert-manager (to a version >= 1.3.2) and re-run the job. The secret will be correctly created and the k8s-metadata-injection pod will be able to start. Note that the new version of the manifest and of the nri-bundle are already updated with the correct version of the image. Problem In OpenShift version 4.x, the CA that is used in order to patch the mutatingwebhookconfiguration resource is not the one used when signing the certificates. This is a known issue currently tracked here. In the logs of the Pod nri-metadata-injection, you'll see the following error message: TLS handshake error from 10.131.0.29:37428: remote error: tls: unknown certificate authority TLS handshake error from 10.129.0.1:49314: remote error: tls: bad certificate Copy Workaround Manually update the certificate stored in the mutatingwebhookconfiguration object. The correct CA locations might change according to the cluster configuration. However, you can usually find the CA in the secret csr-signer in the namespace openshift-kube-controller-manager. Problem There is no Kubernetes metadata included in the transactions' attributes of your APM agent or in distributed tracing. Solution Verify that the environment variables are being correctly injected by following the instructions described in the Validate your installation step. If they are not present, get the name of the metadata injection pod by running: kubectl get pods | grep newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment kubectl logs -f pod/podname Copy In another terminal, create a new pod (for example, see Validate your installation), and inspect the logs of the metadata injection deployment for errors. For every created pod there should be a set of 4 new entries in the logs like: {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.107Z\",\"caller\":\"server/main.go:139\",\"msg\":\"POST https://newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default.svc:443/mutate?timeout=30s HTTP/2.0\\\" from 10.11.49.2:32836\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.110Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:168\",\"msg\":\"received admission review\",\"kind\":\"/v1, Kind=Pod\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"name\":\"\",\"pod\":\"busybox1\",\"UID\":\"6577519b-7a61-11ea-965e-0e46d1c9335c\",\"operation\":\"CREATE\",\"userinfo\":{\"username\":\"admin\",\"uid\":\"admin\",\"groups\":[\"system:masters\",\"system:authenticated\"]}} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:182\",\"msg\":\"admission response created\",\"response\":\"[{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env\\\",\\\"value\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"adn_kops\\\"}]},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"spec.nodeName\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.namespace\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.name\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}}]\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:257\",\"msg\":\"writing response\"} Copy If there are no new entries on the logs, it means that the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook service, this could be due to networking rules or security groups rejecting the communication. To check if the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook you should inspect the apiserver logs for errors like: failed calling webhook \"metadata-injection.newrelic.com\": ERROR_REASON Copy To get the apiserver logs: Start a proxy to the Kubernetes API server by the executing the following command in a terminal window and keep it running. kubectl proxy --port=8001 Copy Create a new pod in your cluster, this will make the apiserver try to communicate with the webhook. The following command will create a busybox. kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Retrieve the apiserver logs. curl localhost:8001/logs/kube-apiserver.log > apiserver.log Copy Delete the busybox container. kubectl delete -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Inspect the logs for errors. grep -E 'failed calling webhook' apiserver.log Copy Remember that one of the requirements for the metadata injection is that the apiserver must be allowed egress to the pods running on the cluster. If you encounter errors regarding connection timeouts or failed connections, make sure to check the security groups and firewall rules of the cluster. If there are no log entries in either the apiserver logs or the metadata injection deployment, it means that the webhook was not properly registered. Ensure the metadata injection setup job ran successfully by inspecting the output of: kubectl get job newrelic-metadata-setup Copy If the job is not completed, investigate the logs of the setup job: kubectl logs job/newrelic-metadata-setup Copy Ensure the CertificateSigningRequest is approved and issued by running: kubectl get csr newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default Copy Ensure the TLS secret is present by running: kubectl get secret newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Ensure the CA bundle is present in the mutating webhook configuration: kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg -o json Copy Ensure the TargetPort of the Service resource matches the Port of the Deployment's container: kubectl describe service/newrelic-metadata-injection-svc kubectl describe deployment/newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment Copy",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

For more information, see this New Relic blog post. You can quickly start monitoring Kubernetes clusters using Auto-telemetry with Pixie, which is currently a beta release. This Pixie integration into New Relic does not require a language agent. Learn more about Auto-telemetry with Pixie here. Tip Our Kubernetes metadata injection project is open source. Here's the code to link APM and infrastructure data and the code to automatically manage certificates. Compatibility and requirements Before linking Kubernetes metadata to your APM agents, make sure you meet the following requirements: Kubernetes requirements Network requirements APM agent compatibility OpenShift requirements Kubernetes requirements To link your applications and Kubernetes, your cluster must have the MutatingAdmissionWebhook controller enabled, which requires Kubernetes 1.9 or higher. To verify that your cluster is compatible, run the following command: kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 Copy If you see a different result, follow the Kubernetes documentation to enable admission control in your cluster. Network requirements For Kubernetes to speak to our MutatingAdmissionWebhook, the master node (or the API server container, depending on how the cluster is set up) should be allowed egress for HTTPS traffic on port 443 to pods in all of the other nodes in the cluster. This might require specific configuration depending on how the infrastructure is set up (on-premises, AWS, Google Cloud, etc). Tip Until Kubernetes v1.14, users were only allowed to register admission webhooks on port 443. Since v1.15 it's possible to register them on different ports. To ensure backward compatibility, the webhook is registered by default on port 443 in the YAML config file we distribute. APM agent compatibility The following New Relic agents collect Kubernetes metadata: Go 2.3.0 or higher Java 4.10.0 or higher Node.js 5.3.0 or higher Python 4.14.0 or higher Ruby 6.1.0 or higher .NET 8.17.438 or higher Openshift requirements To link Openshift and Kubernetes you must enable mutating admission webhooks, which requires Openshift 3.9 or higher. During the process, install a resource that requires admin permissions to the cluster. Run this to log in as admin: oc login -u system:admin Copy Check that webhooks are correctly configured. If they are not, update the master-config.yaml file. admissionConfig: pluginConfig: MutatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission ValidatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission location: \"\" Copy Important Add kubeConfigFile: /dev/null to address some issues in Openshift. Enable certificate signing by editing the YAML file and updating your configuration: kubernetesMasterConfig: controllerArguments: cluster-signing-cert-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.crt\" cluster-signing-key-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.key\" Copy Restart the Openshift services in the master node. Configure the injection of metadata By default, all the pods you create that include APM agents have the correct environment variables set and the metadata injection applies to the entire cluster. To check that the environment variables have been set, any container that is running must be stopped, and a new instance started (see Validate the injection of metadata). This default configuration also uses the Kubernetes certificates API to automatically manage the certificates required for the injection. If needed, you can limit the injection of metadata to specific namespaces in your cluster or self-manage your certificates. Default configuration To proceed with the default injection of metadata, follow these steps: Download the YAML file: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Custom configuration You can limit the injection of metadata only to specific namespaces by using labels. To enable this feature, edit your YAML file by finding and uncommenting the following lines: # namespaceSelector: # matchLabels: # newrelic-metadata-injection: enabled Copy With this option, injection is only applied to those namespaces that have the newrelic-metadata-injection label set to enabled: kubectl label namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE newrelic-metadata-injection=enabled Copy Manage custom certificates To use custom certificates you need a specific YAML file: Download the YAML file without automatic certificate management: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Once you have the correct YAML file, you can proceed with the custom certificate management option. You need your certificate, server key, and Certification Authority (CA) bundle encoded in PEM format. If you have them in the standard certificate format (X.509), install openssl, and run the following: openssl x509 -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out CERTIFICATE_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in SERVER_KEY_FILENAME -outform PEM -out SERVER_KEY_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in CA_BUNDLE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out BUNDLE_FILENAME.pem Copy If your certificate/key pair are in another format, see the Digicert knowledgebase for more help. Create the TLS secret with the signed certificate/key pair, and patch the mutating webhook configuration with the CA using the following commands: kubectl create secret tls newrelic-metadata-injection-secret \\ --key=PEM_ENCODED_SERVER_KEY \\ --cert=PEM_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE \\ --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl -n default apply -f - caBundle=$(cat PEM_ENCODED_CA_BUNDLE | base64 | td -d '\\n') kubectl patch mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg --type='json' -p \"[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle', 'value':'${caBundle}'}]\" Copy Important Certificates signed by Kubernetes have an expiration of one year. For more information, see the Kubernetes source code in GitHub. Validate the injection of metadata In order to validate that the webhook (responsible for injecting the metadata) was installed correctly, deploy a new pod and check for the New Relic environment variables. Create a dummy pod containing Busybox by running: kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Check if New Relic environment variables were injected: kubectl exec busybox0 -- env | grep NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME=fsi NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME=nodea NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME=default NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME=busybox0 NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME=busybox Copy Disable the injection of metadata To disable/uninstall the injection of metadata, use the following commands: Delete the Kubernetes objects using the yaml file: kubectl delete -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Delete the TLS secret containing the certificate/key pair: kubectl delete secret/newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Troubleshooting Follow these troubleshooting tips as needed. No Kubernetes metadata in APM or distributed tracing transactions Problem The creation of the secret by the k8s-webhook-cert-manager job used to fail due to the kubectl version used by the image when running in Kubernetes version 1.19.x, The new version 1.3.2 fixes this issue, therefore it is enough to run again the job using an update version of the image to fix the issue. Solution Update the image k8s-webhook-cert-manager (to a version >= 1.3.2) and re-run the job. The secret will be correctly created and the k8s-metadata-injection pod will be able to start. Note that the new version of the manifest and of the nri-bundle are already updated with the correct version of the image. Problem In OpenShift version 4.x, the CA that is used in order to patch the mutatingwebhookconfiguration resource is not the one used when signing the certificates. This is a known issue currently tracked here. In the logs of the Pod nri-metadata-injection, you'll see the following error message: TLS handshake error from 10.131.0.29:37428: remote error: tls: unknown certificate authority TLS handshake error from 10.129.0.1:49314: remote error: tls: bad certificate Copy Workaround Manually update the certificate stored in the mutatingwebhookconfiguration object. The correct CA locations might change according to the cluster configuration. However, you can usually find the CA in the secret csr-signer in the namespace openshift-kube-controller-manager. Problem There is no Kubernetes metadata included in the transactions' attributes of your APM agent or in distributed tracing. Solution Verify that the environment variables are being correctly injected by following the instructions described in the Validate your installation step. If they are not present, get the name of the metadata injection pod by running: kubectl get pods | grep newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment kubectl logs -f pod/podname Copy In another terminal, create a new pod (for example, see Validate your installation), and inspect the logs of the metadata injection deployment for errors. For every created pod there should be a set of 4 new entries in the logs like: {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.107Z\",\"caller\":\"server/main.go:139\",\"msg\":\"POST https://newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default.svc:443/mutate?timeout=30s HTTP/2.0\\\" from 10.11.49.2:32836\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.110Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:168\",\"msg\":\"received admission review\",\"kind\":\"/v1, Kind=Pod\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"name\":\"\",\"pod\":\"busybox1\",\"UID\":\"6577519b-7a61-11ea-965e-0e46d1c9335c\",\"operation\":\"CREATE\",\"userinfo\":{\"username\":\"admin\",\"uid\":\"admin\",\"groups\":[\"system:masters\",\"system:authenticated\"]}} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:182\",\"msg\":\"admission response created\",\"response\":\"[{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env\\\",\\\"value\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"adn_kops\\\"}]},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"spec.nodeName\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.namespace\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.name\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}}]\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:257\",\"msg\":\"writing response\"} Copy If there are no new entries on the logs, it means that the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook service, this could be due to networking rules or security groups rejecting the communication. To check if the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook you should inspect the apiserver logs for errors like: failed calling webhook \"metadata-injection.newrelic.com\": ERROR_REASON Copy To get the apiserver logs: Start a proxy to the Kubernetes API server by the executing the following command in a terminal window and keep it running. kubectl proxy --port=8001 Copy Create a new pod in your cluster, this will make the apiserver try to communicate with the webhook. The following command will create a busybox. kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Retrieve the apiserver logs. curl localhost:8001/logs/kube-apiserver.log > apiserver.log Copy Delete the busybox container. kubectl delete -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Inspect the logs for errors. grep -E 'failed calling webhook' apiserver.log Copy Remember that one of the requirements for the metadata injection is that the apiserver must be allowed egress to the pods running on the cluster. If you encounter errors regarding connection timeouts or failed connections, make sure to check the security groups and firewall rules of the cluster. If there are no log entries in either the apiserver logs or the metadata injection deployment, it means that the webhook was not properly registered.

With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "You can surface Kubernetes metadata and link it to your APM agents as distributed traces to explore performance issues and troubleshoot transaction errors. For more information, see this New Relic blog post. You can quickly start monitoring Kubernetes clusters using Auto-telemetry with Pixie, which is currently a beta release. This Pixie integration into New Relic does not require a language agent. Learn more about Auto-telemetry with Pixie here. Tip Our Kubernetes metadata injection project is open source. Here's the code to link APM and infrastructure data and the code to automatically manage certificates. Compatibility and requirements Before linking Kubernetes metadata to your APM agents, make sure you meet the following requirements: Kubernetes requirements Network requirements APM agent compatibility OpenShift requirements Kubernetes requirements To link your applications and Kubernetes, your cluster must have the MutatingAdmissionWebhook controller enabled, which requires Kubernetes 1.9 or higher. To verify that your cluster is compatible, run the following command: kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 Copy If you see a different result, follow the Kubernetes documentation to enable admission control in your cluster. Network requirements For Kubernetes to speak to our MutatingAdmissionWebhook, the master node (or the API server container, depending on how the cluster is set up) should be allowed egress for HTTPS traffic on port 443 to pods in all of the other nodes in the cluster. This might require specific configuration depending on how the infrastructure is set up (on-premises, AWS, Google Cloud, etc). Tip Until Kubernetes v1.14, users were only allowed to register admission webhooks on port 443. Since v1.15 it's possible to register them on different ports. To ensure backward compatibility, the webhook is registered by default on port 443 in the YAML config file we distribute. APM agent compatibility The following New Relic agents collect Kubernetes metadata: Go 2.3.0 or higher Java 4.10.0 or higher Node.js 5.3.0 or higher Python 4.14.0 or higher Ruby 6.1.0 or higher .NET 8.17.438 or higher Openshift requirements To link Openshift and Kubernetes you must enable mutating admission webhooks, which requires Openshift 3.9 or higher. During the process, install a resource that requires admin permissions to the cluster. Run this to log in as admin: oc login -u system:admin Copy Check that webhooks are correctly configured. If they are not, update the master-config.yaml file. admissionConfig: pluginConfig: MutatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission ValidatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission location: \"\" Copy Important Add kubeConfigFile: /dev/null to address some issues in Openshift. Enable certificate signing by editing the YAML file and updating your configuration: kubernetesMasterConfig: controllerArguments: cluster-signing-cert-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.crt\" cluster-signing-key-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.key\" Copy Restart the Openshift services in the master node. Configure the injection of metadata By default, all the pods you create that include APM agents have the correct environment variables set and the metadata injection applies to the entire cluster. To check that the environment variables have been set, any container that is running must be stopped, and a new instance started (see Validate the injection of metadata). This default configuration also uses the Kubernetes certificates API to automatically manage the certificates required for the injection. If needed, you can limit the injection of metadata to specific namespaces in your cluster or self-manage your certificates. Default configuration To proceed with the default injection of metadata, follow these steps: Download the YAML file: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Custom configuration You can limit the injection of metadata only to specific namespaces by using labels. To enable this feature, edit your YAML file by finding and uncommenting the following lines: # namespaceSelector: # matchLabels: # newrelic-metadata-injection: enabled Copy With this option, injection is only applied to those namespaces that have the newrelic-metadata-injection label set to enabled: kubectl label namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE newrelic-metadata-injection=enabled Copy Manage custom certificates To use custom certificates you need a specific YAML file: Download the YAML file without automatic certificate management: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Once you have the correct YAML file, you can proceed with the custom certificate management option. You need your certificate, server key, and Certification Authority (CA) bundle encoded in PEM format. If you have them in the standard certificate format (X.509), install openssl, and run the following: openssl x509 -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out CERTIFICATE_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in SERVER_KEY_FILENAME -outform PEM -out SERVER_KEY_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in CA_BUNDLE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out BUNDLE_FILENAME.pem Copy If your certificate/key pair are in another format, see the Digicert knowledgebase for more help. Create the TLS secret with the signed certificate/key pair, and patch the mutating webhook configuration with the CA using the following commands: kubectl create secret tls newrelic-metadata-injection-secret \\ --key=PEM_ENCODED_SERVER_KEY \\ --cert=PEM_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE \\ --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl -n default apply -f - caBundle=$(cat PEM_ENCODED_CA_BUNDLE | base64 | td -d '\\n') kubectl patch mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg --type='json' -p \"[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle', 'value':'${caBundle}'}]\" Copy Important Certificates signed by Kubernetes have an expiration of one year. For more information, see the Kubernetes source code in GitHub. Validate the injection of metadata In order to validate that the webhook (responsible for injecting the metadata) was installed correctly, deploy a new pod and check for the New Relic environment variables. Create a dummy pod containing Busybox by running: kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Check if New Relic environment variables were injected: kubectl exec busybox0 -- env | grep NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME=fsi NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME=nodea NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME=default NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME=busybox0 NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME=busybox Copy Disable the injection of metadata To disable/uninstall the injection of metadata, use the following commands: Delete the Kubernetes objects using the yaml file: kubectl delete -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Delete the TLS secret containing the certificate/key pair: kubectl delete secret/newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Troubleshooting Follow these troubleshooting tips as needed. No Kubernetes metadata in APM or distributed tracing transactions Problem The creation of the secret by the k8s-webhook-cert-manager job used to fail due to the kubectl version used by the image when running in Kubernetes version 1.19.x, The new version 1.3.2 fixes this issue, therefore it is enough to run again the job using an update version of the image to fix the issue. Solution Update the image k8s-webhook-cert-manager (to a version >= 1.3.2) and re-run the job. The secret will be correctly created and the k8s-metadata-injection pod will be able to start. Note that the new version of the manifest and of the nri-bundle are already updated with the correct version of the image. Problem In OpenShift version 4.x, the CA that is used in order to patch the mutatingwebhookconfiguration resource is not the one used when signing the certificates. This is a known issue currently tracked here. In the logs of the Pod nri-metadata-injection, you'll see the following error message: TLS handshake error from 10.131.0.29:37428: remote error: tls: unknown certificate authority TLS handshake error from 10.129.0.1:49314: remote error: tls: bad certificate Copy Workaround Manually update the certificate stored in the mutatingwebhookconfiguration object. The correct CA locations might change according to the cluster configuration. However, you can usually find the CA in the secret csr-signer in the namespace openshift-kube-controller-manager. Problem There is no Kubernetes metadata included in the transactions' attributes of your APM agent or in distributed tracing. Solution Verify that the environment variables are being correctly injected by following the instructions described in the Validate your installation step. If they are not present, get the name of the metadata injection pod by running: kubectl get pods | grep newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment kubectl logs -f pod/podname Copy In another terminal, create a new pod (for example, see Validate your installation), and inspect the logs of the metadata injection deployment for errors. For every created pod there should be a set of 4 new entries in the logs like: {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.107Z\",\"caller\":\"server/main.go:139\",\"msg\":\"POST https://newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default.svc:443/mutate?timeout=30s HTTP/2.0\\\" from 10.11.49.2:32836\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.110Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:168\",\"msg\":\"received admission review\",\"kind\":\"/v1, Kind=Pod\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"name\":\"\",\"pod\":\"busybox1\",\"UID\":\"6577519b-7a61-11ea-965e-0e46d1c9335c\",\"operation\":\"CREATE\",\"userinfo\":{\"username\":\"admin\",\"uid\":\"admin\",\"groups\":[\"system:masters\",\"system:authenticated\"]}} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:182\",\"msg\":\"admission response created\",\"response\":\"[{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env\\\",\\\"value\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"adn_kops\\\"}]},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"spec.nodeName\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.namespace\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.name\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}}]\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:257\",\"msg\":\"writing response\"} Copy If there are no new entries on the logs, it means that the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook service, this could be due to networking rules or security groups rejecting the communication. To check if the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook you should inspect the apiserver logs for errors like: failed calling webhook \"metadata-injection.newrelic.com\": ERROR_REASON Copy To get the apiserver logs: Start a proxy to the Kubernetes API server by the executing the following command in a terminal window and keep it running. kubectl proxy --port=8001 Copy Create a new pod in your cluster, this will make the apiserver try to communicate with the webhook. The following command will create a busybox. kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Retrieve the apiserver logs. curl localhost:8001/logs/kube-apiserver.log > apiserver.log Copy Delete the busybox container. kubectl delete -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Inspect the logs for errors. grep -E 'failed calling webhook' apiserver.log Copy Remember that one of the requirements for the metadata injection is that the apiserver must be allowed egress to the pods running on the cluster. If you encounter errors regarding connection timeouts or failed connections, make sure to check the security groups and firewall rules of the cluster. If there are no log entries in either the apiserver logs or the metadata injection deployment, it means that the webhook was not properly registered. Ensure the metadata injection setup job ran successfully by inspecting the output of: kubectl get job newrelic-metadata-setup Copy If the job is not completed, investigate the logs of the setup job: kubectl logs job/newrelic-metadata-setup Copy Ensure the CertificateSigningRequest is approved and issued by running: kubectl get csr newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default Copy Ensure the TLS secret is present by running: kubectl get secret newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Ensure the CA bundle is present in the mutating webhook configuration: kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg -o json Copy Ensure the TargetPort of the Service resource matches the Port of the Deployment's container: kubectl describe service/newrelic-metadata-injection-svc kubectl describe deployment/newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment Copy",

This tutorial shows how to enable monitoring for a Redis service running on the Kubernetes PHP Guestbook. For the general procedure, see Monitor a Kubernetes-running service. What you need See the general requirements for this feature, including supported services. The kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you don't have a cluster, you can create one using Minikube. Step 1: Set up an example Redis application This tutorial builds on the Kubernetes tutorial Deploying a PHP Guestbook application with Redis. Skip the Kubernetes tutorial and run the following command to set up the application needed for our tutorial: kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/examples/master/guestbook/all-in-one/guestbook-all-in-one.yaml Copy If you'd like to first complete the Kubernetes tutorial, follow their tutorial instructions but do not follow the instructions in the Cleaning up section. Step 2: Enable monitoring of Redis instances The PHP Guestbook application has three Redis instances: one master and two slave instances. Each instance is tagged with a label where app=redis. For this example, we're using our Redis monitoring integration. It can monitor both master and slave instances of Redis, so we don’t have to distinguish between them. In the Kubernetes integration's YAML config file (newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml), you need to update the nri-integration-cfg section. From the list of integration configs, get the Redis integration YAML and add it to the Kubernetes config. The Redis YAML is highlighted below. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: redis-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=redis\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Run discovery for Kubernetes.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "You can surface Kubernetes metadata and link it to your APM agents as distributed traces to explore performance issues and troubleshoot transaction errors. For more information, see this New Relic blog post. You can quickly start monitoring Kubernetes clusters using Auto-telemetry with Pixie, which is currently a beta release. This Pixie integration into New Relic does not require a language agent. Learn more about Auto-telemetry with Pixie here. Tip Our Kubernetes metadata injection project is open source. Here's the code to link APM and infrastructure data and the code to automatically manage certificates. Compatibility and requirements Before linking Kubernetes metadata to your APM agents, make sure you meet the following requirements: Kubernetes requirements Network requirements APM agent compatibility OpenShift requirements Kubernetes requirements To link your applications and Kubernetes, your cluster must have the MutatingAdmissionWebhook controller enabled, which requires Kubernetes 1.9 or higher. To verify that your cluster is compatible, run the following command: kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 Copy If you see a different result, follow the Kubernetes documentation to enable admission control in your cluster. Network requirements For Kubernetes to speak to our MutatingAdmissionWebhook, the master node (or the API server container, depending on how the cluster is set up) should be allowed egress for HTTPS traffic on port 443 to pods in all of the other nodes in the cluster. This might require specific configuration depending on how the infrastructure is set up (on-premises, AWS, Google Cloud, etc). Tip Until Kubernetes v1.14, users were only allowed to register admission webhooks on port 443. Since v1.15 it's possible to register them on different ports. To ensure backward compatibility, the webhook is registered by default on port 443 in the YAML config file we distribute. APM agent compatibility The following New Relic agents collect Kubernetes metadata: Go 2.3.0 or higher Java 4.10.0 or higher Node.js 5.3.0 or higher Python 4.14.0 or higher Ruby 6.1.0 or higher .NET 8.17.438 or higher Openshift requirements To link Openshift and Kubernetes you must enable mutating admission webhooks, which requires Openshift 3.9 or higher. During the process, install a resource that requires admin permissions to the cluster. Run this to log in as admin: oc login -u system:admin Copy Check that webhooks are correctly configured. If they are not, update the master-config.yaml file. admissionConfig: pluginConfig: MutatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission ValidatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission location: \"\" Copy Important Add kubeConfigFile: /dev/null to address some issues in Openshift. Enable certificate signing by editing the YAML file and updating your configuration: kubernetesMasterConfig: controllerArguments: cluster-signing-cert-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.crt\" cluster-signing-key-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.key\" Copy Restart the Openshift services in the master node. Configure the injection of metadata By default, all the pods you create that include APM agents have the correct environment variables set and the metadata injection applies to the entire cluster. To check that the environment variables have been set, any container that is running must be stopped, and a new instance started (see Validate the injection of metadata). This default configuration also uses the Kubernetes certificates API to automatically manage the certificates required for the injection. If needed, you can limit the injection of metadata to specific namespaces in your cluster or self-manage your certificates. Default configuration To proceed with the default injection of metadata, follow these steps: Download the YAML file: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Custom configuration You can limit the injection of metadata only to specific namespaces by using labels. To enable this feature, edit your YAML file by finding and uncommenting the following lines: # namespaceSelector: # matchLabels: # newrelic-metadata-injection: enabled Copy With this option, injection is only applied to those namespaces that have the newrelic-metadata-injection label set to enabled: kubectl label namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE newrelic-metadata-injection=enabled Copy Manage custom certificates To use custom certificates you need a specific YAML file: Download the YAML file without automatic certificate management: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Once you have the correct YAML file, you can proceed with the custom certificate management option. You need your certificate, server key, and Certification Authority (CA) bundle encoded in PEM format. If you have them in the standard certificate format (X.509), install openssl, and run the following: openssl x509 -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out CERTIFICATE_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in SERVER_KEY_FILENAME -outform PEM -out SERVER_KEY_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in CA_BUNDLE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out BUNDLE_FILENAME.pem Copy If your certificate/key pair are in another format, see the Digicert knowledgebase for more help. Create the TLS secret with the signed certificate/key pair, and patch the mutating webhook configuration with the CA using the following commands: kubectl create secret tls newrelic-metadata-injection-secret \\ --key=PEM_ENCODED_SERVER_KEY \\ --cert=PEM_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE \\ --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl -n default apply -f - caBundle=$(cat PEM_ENCODED_CA_BUNDLE | base64 | td -d '\\n') kubectl patch mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg --type='json' -p \"[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle', 'value':'${caBundle}'}]\" Copy Important Certificates signed by Kubernetes have an expiration of one year. For more information, see the Kubernetes source code in GitHub. Validate the injection of metadata In order to validate that the webhook (responsible for injecting the metadata) was installed correctly, deploy a new pod and check for the New Relic environment variables. Create a dummy pod containing Busybox by running: kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Check if New Relic environment variables were injected: kubectl exec busybox0 -- env | grep NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME=fsi NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME=nodea NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME=default NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME=busybox0 NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME=busybox Copy Disable the injection of metadata To disable/uninstall the injection of metadata, use the following commands: Delete the Kubernetes objects using the yaml file: kubectl delete -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Delete the TLS secret containing the certificate/key pair: kubectl delete secret/newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Troubleshooting Follow these troubleshooting tips as needed. No Kubernetes metadata in APM or distributed tracing transactions Problem The creation of the secret by the k8s-webhook-cert-manager job used to fail due to the kubectl version used by the image when running in Kubernetes version 1.19.x, The new version 1.3.2 fixes this issue, therefore it is enough to run again the job using an update version of the image to fix the issue. Solution Update the image k8s-webhook-cert-manager (to a version >= 1.3.2) and re-run the job. The secret will be correctly created and the k8s-metadata-injection pod will be able to start. Note that the new version of the manifest and of the nri-bundle are already updated with the correct version of the image. Problem In OpenShift version 4.x, the CA that is used in order to patch the mutatingwebhookconfiguration resource is not the one used when signing the certificates. This is a known issue currently tracked here. In the logs of the Pod nri-metadata-injection, you'll see the following error message: TLS handshake error from 10.131.0.29:37428: remote error: tls: unknown certificate authority TLS handshake error from 10.129.0.1:49314: remote error: tls: bad certificate Copy Workaround Manually update the certificate stored in the mutatingwebhookconfiguration object. The correct CA locations might change according to the cluster configuration. However, you can usually find the CA in the secret csr-signer in the namespace openshift-kube-controller-manager. Problem There is no Kubernetes metadata included in the transactions' attributes of your APM agent or in distributed tracing. Solution Verify that the environment variables are being correctly injected by following the instructions described in the Validate your installation step. If they are not present, get the name of the metadata injection pod by running: kubectl get pods | grep newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment kubectl logs -f pod/podname Copy In another terminal, create a new pod (for example, see Validate your installation), and inspect the logs of the metadata injection deployment for errors. For every created pod there should be a set of 4 new entries in the logs like: {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.107Z\",\"caller\":\"server/main.go:139\",\"msg\":\"POST https://newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default.svc:443/mutate?timeout=30s HTTP/2.0\\\" from 10.11.49.2:32836\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.110Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:168\",\"msg\":\"received admission review\",\"kind\":\"/v1, Kind=Pod\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"name\":\"\",\"pod\":\"busybox1\",\"UID\":\"6577519b-7a61-11ea-965e-0e46d1c9335c\",\"operation\":\"CREATE\",\"userinfo\":{\"username\":\"admin\",\"uid\":\"admin\",\"groups\":[\"system:masters\",\"system:authenticated\"]}} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:182\",\"msg\":\"admission response created\",\"response\":\"[{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env\\\",\\\"value\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"adn_kops\\\"}]},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"spec.nodeName\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.namespace\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.name\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}}]\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:257\",\"msg\":\"writing response\"} Copy If there are no new entries on the logs, it means that the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook service, this could be due to networking rules or security groups rejecting the communication. To check if the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook you should inspect the apiserver logs for errors like: failed calling webhook \"metadata-injection.newrelic.com\": ERROR_REASON Copy To get the apiserver logs: Start a proxy to the Kubernetes API server by the executing the following command in a terminal window and keep it running. kubectl proxy --port=8001 Copy Create a new pod in your cluster, this will make the apiserver try to communicate with the webhook. The following command will create a busybox. kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Retrieve the apiserver logs. curl localhost:8001/logs/kube-apiserver.log > apiserver.log Copy Delete the busybox container. kubectl delete -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Inspect the logs for errors. grep -E 'failed calling webhook' apiserver.log Copy Remember that one of the requirements for the metadata injection is that the apiserver must be allowed egress to the pods running on the cluster. If you encounter errors regarding connection timeouts or failed connections, make sure to check the security groups and firewall rules of the cluster. If there are no log entries in either the apiserver logs or the metadata injection deployment, it means that the webhook was not properly registered. Ensure the metadata injection setup job ran successfully by inspecting the output of: kubectl get job newrelic-metadata-setup Copy If the job is not completed, investigate the logs of the setup job: kubectl logs job/newrelic-metadata-setup Copy Ensure the CertificateSigningRequest is approved and issued by running: kubectl get csr newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default Copy Ensure the TLS secret is present by running: kubectl get secret newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Ensure the CA bundle is present in the mutating webhook configuration: kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg -o json Copy Ensure the TargetPort of the Service resource matches the Port of the Deployment's container: kubectl describe service/newrelic-metadata-injection-svc kubectl describe deployment/newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment Copy",

      "body": "With New Relic's Kubernetes integration you can monitor both Kubernetes and the services running on it, such as Cassandra, Redis, MySQL, and other supported services. Get started Our Kubernetes integration comes bundled with some of our on-host integrations (like Cassandra, MySQL, and Apache). This lets you get data for those supported services by adding a section to the Kubernetes integration's configuration, which lives as a ConfigMap inside a manifest. What you need Enable this feature for a service Details about how configuration works For an example of how to monitor Redis running on a Kubernetes PHP Guestbook, see this tutorial. What you need To monitor services running on Kubernetes, you only need a Kubernetes cluster running the Kubernetes integration, version 1.13.0 or higher (install | check version | update). We support the following services running on Kubernetes: Apache (does not report inventory data) Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ (does not report inventory data) Redis SNMP Enable monitoring of services To enable our Kubernetes integration to monitor one or more services: Expand this dropdown and get the YAML snippets for the service(s) you want to monitor: Get the config YAML for the integration For the services you want to monitor, follow the links to GitHub to get the YAML snippets you'll need for the next step: Apache Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ Redis SNMP Add the snippet to the Kubernetes integration's ConfigMap, after the data: section: Example configuration This example shows the YAML config for the Apache integration ( highlighted ) added to the Kubernetes integration's config.

You should see data being reported. Additional notes about enabling services: Enabling multiple services may use more resources than what is set in the resource limits of the Kubernetes integration config file. If this becomes an issue, raise the limit in the resources section. The Kubernetes integration does not automatically update. For best results, regularly update. Monitor services in our Kubernetes integration installed with Helm If you installed our Kubernetes integration using Helm, to monitor services you need to update the existing installation with the new configuration, which contains the services to monitor: helm upgrade --reuse-values -f values.yaml [RELEASE] [CHART] Copy If you use nri-bundle charts, you need to update the children's chart values. Find some examples here. Learn more More resources for learning about configuration: Learn technical details about how configuration works. Learn how to configure monitoring of multiple services with the same config file. See a step-by-step tutorial showing how to monitor a Redis service on Kubernetes. Manually configure service monitoring The enable procedure should be all you need to get monitoring working, but if you run into problems, understanding some technical details about configuration can be helpful. This section goes into more detail about how configuration works. For each service you wish to monitor, you must add a configuration file for that integration to our Kubernetes integration's configuration. This document will cover these subjects: How the service-specific configuration YAML snippet works Adding the service-specific YAML in the Kubernetes integration's config file Adding multiple services to the Kubernetes integration's config file How the service-specific YAML config works Our Kubernetes integration's configuration follows the ConfigMap format. Using a ConfigMap allows us to decouple the configuration for the integrations from the Kubernetes image. The other benefit is that a ConfigMap can be updated automatically without reloading the running container. Because the infrastructure agent uses YAML to configure its associated integrations, ConfigMaps are a good choice for storing YAML. (For more information on config file format, see the Integration config file format.) The Kubernetes integration image comes with an auto-discovery feature that simplifies the configuration of multiple instances of services using a single configuration file. For example, if you have several NGINX instances running, creating an NGINX integration configuration file for every instance would be hard to implement and hard to update. With our auto-discovery option, you can discover and monitor all your NGINX instances with a single configuration file. Each integration has its own specific configuration YAML. Our NGINX integration default config file looks like this: nginx-config.yml: | --- discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet. Default is 10255 # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # Custom Example: # exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes --namespaces namespace1,namespace2 --port 10250 --tls # Default exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes match: label.app: nginx integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}/status STATUS_MODULE: discover METRICS: 1 Copy The above config enables the following: Runs nri-discovery-kubernetes to query the data for the node we are currently on. Parses the data that comes back and looks for any Kubernetes pod that has a Kubernetes container with an app= label with value nginx. For any matches, it attempts to run the NGINX integration. The status URL is built from: The pod's IP address The status page is pulled from the label on K8s pod called status_url This automatic discovery works the same as the container auto-discovery used by the infrastructure agent. For more advanced options, see Container auto-discovery. Add a service YAML to the Kubernetes integration config It's best practice to configure enabled integrations alongside the Kubernetes integration configuration. This is easier than maintaining configuration files for every single service/integration instance. Below is an example of a Kubernetes integration's ConfigMap. The highlighted section shows where an integration configuration YAML (in this case, NGINX) is placed. For more information on discovery:, see Container auto-discovery for on-host integrations. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet.

Make sure the namespace used is the same one used by the Kubernetes integration manifest. If you haven't changed it in the downloaded manifest file, the value is default. Add multiple services to the same config You can monitor several services using the same Kubernetes integration config file. To do this, add another integration configuration YAML to the same Kubernetes integration config file. Below is the Kubernetes config created in the last section, with a new section for the Cassandra integration's config (highlighted). --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Run discovery for Kubernetes.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

You should see data being reported. Additional notes about enabling services: Enabling multiple services may use more resources than what is set in the resource limits of the Kubernetes integration config file. If this becomes an issue, raise the limit in the resources section. The Kubernetes integration does not automatically update. For best results, regularly update. Monitor services in our Kubernetes integration installed with Helm If you installed our Kubernetes integration using Helm, to monitor services you need to update the existing installation with the new configuration, which contains the services to monitor: helm upgrade --reuse-values -f values.yaml [RELEASE] [CHART] Copy If you use nri-bundle charts, you need to update the children's chart values. Find some examples here. Learn more More resources for learning about configuration: Learn technical details about how configuration works. Learn how to configure monitoring of multiple services with the same config file. See a step-by-step tutorial showing how to monitor a Redis service on Kubernetes. Manually configure service monitoring The enable procedure should be all you need to get monitoring working, but if you run into problems, understanding some technical details about configuration can be helpful. This section goes into more detail about how configuration works. For each service you wish to monitor, you must add a configuration file for that integration to our Kubernetes integration's configuration. This document will cover these subjects: How the service-specific configuration YAML snippet works Adding the service-specific YAML in the Kubernetes integration's config file Adding multiple services to the Kubernetes integration's config file How the service-specific YAML config works Our Kubernetes integration's configuration follows the ConfigMap format. Using a ConfigMap allows us to decouple the configuration for the integrations from the Kubernetes image. The other benefit is that a ConfigMap can be updated automatically without reloading the running container. Because the infrastructure agent uses YAML to configure its associated integrations, ConfigMaps are a good choice for storing YAML. (For more information on config file format, see the Integration config file format.) The Kubernetes integration image comes with an auto-discovery feature that simplifies the configuration of multiple instances of services using a single configuration file. For example, if you have several NGINX instances running, creating an NGINX integration configuration file for every instance would be hard to implement and hard to update.

Step 2: Enable monitoring of Redis instances The PHP Guestbook application has three Redis instances: one master and two slave instances. Each instance is tagged with a label where app=redis. For this example, we're using our Redis monitoring integration. It can monitor both master and slave instances of Redis, so we don’t have to distinguish between them.

      "body": "You can surface Kubernetes metadata and link it to your APM agents as distributed traces to explore performance issues and troubleshoot transaction errors. For more information, see this New Relic blog post. You can quickly start monitoring Kubernetes clusters using Auto-telemetry with Pixie, which is currently a beta release. This Pixie integration into New Relic does not require a language agent. Learn more about Auto-telemetry with Pixie here. Tip Our Kubernetes metadata injection project is open source. Here's the code to link APM and infrastructure data and the code to automatically manage certificates. Compatibility and requirements Before linking Kubernetes metadata to your APM agents, make sure you meet the following requirements: Kubernetes requirements Network requirements APM agent compatibility OpenShift requirements Kubernetes requirements To link your applications and Kubernetes, your cluster must have the MutatingAdmissionWebhook controller enabled, which requires Kubernetes 1.9 or higher. To verify that your cluster is compatible, run the following command: kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 Copy If you see a different result, follow the Kubernetes documentation to enable admission control in your cluster. Network requirements For Kubernetes to speak to our MutatingAdmissionWebhook, the master node (or the API server container, depending on how the cluster is set up) should be allowed egress for HTTPS traffic on port 443 to pods in all of the other nodes in the cluster. This might require specific configuration depending on how the infrastructure is set up (on-premises, AWS, Google Cloud, etc). Tip Until Kubernetes v1.14, users were only allowed to register admission webhooks on port 443. Since v1.15 it's possible to register them on different ports. To ensure backward compatibility, the webhook is registered by default on port 443 in the YAML config file we distribute. APM agent compatibility The following New Relic agents collect Kubernetes metadata: Go 2.3.0 or higher Java 4.10.0 or higher Node.js 5.3.0 or higher Python 4.14.0 or higher Ruby 6.1.0 or higher .NET 8.17.438 or higher Openshift requirements To link Openshift and Kubernetes you must enable mutating admission webhooks, which requires Openshift 3.9 or higher. During the process, install a resource that requires admin permissions to the cluster. Run this to log in as admin: oc login -u system:admin Copy Check that webhooks are correctly configured. If they are not, update the master-config.yaml file. admissionConfig: pluginConfig: MutatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission ValidatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission location: \"\" Copy Important Add kubeConfigFile: /dev/null to address some issues in Openshift. Enable certificate signing by editing the YAML file and updating your configuration: kubernetesMasterConfig: controllerArguments: cluster-signing-cert-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.crt\" cluster-signing-key-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.key\" Copy Restart the Openshift services in the master node. Configure the injection of metadata By default, all the pods you create that include APM agents have the correct environment variables set and the metadata injection applies to the entire cluster. To check that the environment variables have been set, any container that is running must be stopped, and a new instance started (see Validate the injection of metadata). This default configuration also uses the Kubernetes certificates API to automatically manage the certificates required for the injection. If needed, you can limit the injection of metadata to specific namespaces in your cluster or self-manage your certificates. Default configuration To proceed with the default injection of metadata, follow these steps: Download the YAML file: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Custom configuration You can limit the injection of metadata only to specific namespaces by using labels. To enable this feature, edit your YAML file by finding and uncommenting the following lines: # namespaceSelector: # matchLabels: # newrelic-metadata-injection: enabled Copy With this option, injection is only applied to those namespaces that have the newrelic-metadata-injection label set to enabled: kubectl label namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE newrelic-metadata-injection=enabled Copy Manage custom certificates To use custom certificates you need a specific YAML file: Download the YAML file without automatic certificate management: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Once you have the correct YAML file, you can proceed with the custom certificate management option. You need your certificate, server key, and Certification Authority (CA) bundle encoded in PEM format. If you have them in the standard certificate format (X.509), install openssl, and run the following: openssl x509 -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out CERTIFICATE_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in SERVER_KEY_FILENAME -outform PEM -out SERVER_KEY_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in CA_BUNDLE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out BUNDLE_FILENAME.pem Copy If your certificate/key pair are in another format, see the Digicert knowledgebase for more help. Create the TLS secret with the signed certificate/key pair, and patch the mutating webhook configuration with the CA using the following commands: kubectl create secret tls newrelic-metadata-injection-secret \\ --key=PEM_ENCODED_SERVER_KEY \\ --cert=PEM_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE \\ --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl -n default apply -f - caBundle=$(cat PEM_ENCODED_CA_BUNDLE | base64 | td -d '\\n') kubectl patch mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg --type='json' -p \"[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle', 'value':'${caBundle}'}]\" Copy Important Certificates signed by Kubernetes have an expiration of one year. For more information, see the Kubernetes source code in GitHub. Validate the injection of metadata In order to validate that the webhook (responsible for injecting the metadata) was installed correctly, deploy a new pod and check for the New Relic environment variables. Create a dummy pod containing Busybox by running: kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Check if New Relic environment variables were injected: kubectl exec busybox0 -- env | grep NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME=fsi NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME=nodea NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME=default NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME=busybox0 NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME=busybox Copy Disable the injection of metadata To disable/uninstall the injection of metadata, use the following commands: Delete the Kubernetes objects using the yaml file: kubectl delete -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Delete the TLS secret containing the certificate/key pair: kubectl delete secret/newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Troubleshooting Follow these troubleshooting tips as needed. No Kubernetes metadata in APM or distributed tracing transactions Problem The creation of the secret by the k8s-webhook-cert-manager job used to fail due to the kubectl version used by the image when running in Kubernetes version 1.19.x, The new version 1.3.2 fixes this issue, therefore it is enough to run again the job using an update version of the image to fix the issue. Solution Update the image k8s-webhook-cert-manager (to a version >= 1.3.2) and re-run the job. The secret will be correctly created and the k8s-metadata-injection pod will be able to start. Note that the new version of the manifest and of the nri-bundle are already updated with the correct version of the image. Problem In OpenShift version 4.x, the CA that is used in order to patch the mutatingwebhookconfiguration resource is not the one used when signing the certificates. This is a known issue currently tracked here. In the logs of the Pod nri-metadata-injection, you'll see the following error message: TLS handshake error from 10.131.0.29:37428: remote error: tls: unknown certificate authority TLS handshake error from 10.129.0.1:49314: remote error: tls: bad certificate Copy Workaround Manually update the certificate stored in the mutatingwebhookconfiguration object. The correct CA locations might change according to the cluster configuration. However, you can usually find the CA in the secret csr-signer in the namespace openshift-kube-controller-manager. Problem There is no Kubernetes metadata included in the transactions' attributes of your APM agent or in distributed tracing. Solution Verify that the environment variables are being correctly injected by following the instructions described in the Validate your installation step. If they are not present, get the name of the metadata injection pod by running: kubectl get pods | grep newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment kubectl logs -f pod/podname Copy In another terminal, create a new pod (for example, see Validate your installation), and inspect the logs of the metadata injection deployment for errors. For every created pod there should be a set of 4 new entries in the logs like: {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.107Z\",\"caller\":\"server/main.go:139\",\"msg\":\"POST https://newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default.svc:443/mutate?timeout=30s HTTP/2.0\\\" from 10.11.49.2:32836\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.110Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:168\",\"msg\":\"received admission review\",\"kind\":\"/v1, Kind=Pod\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"name\":\"\",\"pod\":\"busybox1\",\"UID\":\"6577519b-7a61-11ea-965e-0e46d1c9335c\",\"operation\":\"CREATE\",\"userinfo\":{\"username\":\"admin\",\"uid\":\"admin\",\"groups\":[\"system:masters\",\"system:authenticated\"]}} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:182\",\"msg\":\"admission response created\",\"response\":\"[{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env\\\",\\\"value\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"adn_kops\\\"}]},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"spec.nodeName\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.namespace\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.name\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}}]\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:257\",\"msg\":\"writing response\"} Copy If there are no new entries on the logs, it means that the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook service, this could be due to networking rules or security groups rejecting the communication. To check if the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook you should inspect the apiserver logs for errors like: failed calling webhook \"metadata-injection.newrelic.com\": ERROR_REASON Copy To get the apiserver logs: Start a proxy to the Kubernetes API server by the executing the following command in a terminal window and keep it running. kubectl proxy --port=8001 Copy Create a new pod in your cluster, this will make the apiserver try to communicate with the webhook. The following command will create a busybox. kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Retrieve the apiserver logs. curl localhost:8001/logs/kube-apiserver.log > apiserver.log Copy Delete the busybox container. kubectl delete -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Inspect the logs for errors. grep -E 'failed calling webhook' apiserver.log Copy Remember that one of the requirements for the metadata injection is that the apiserver must be allowed egress to the pods running on the cluster. If you encounter errors regarding connection timeouts or failed connections, make sure to check the security groups and firewall rules of the cluster. If there are no log entries in either the apiserver logs or the metadata injection deployment, it means that the webhook was not properly registered. Ensure the metadata injection setup job ran successfully by inspecting the output of: kubectl get job newrelic-metadata-setup Copy If the job is not completed, investigate the logs of the setup job: kubectl logs job/newrelic-metadata-setup Copy Ensure the CertificateSigningRequest is approved and issued by running: kubectl get csr newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default Copy Ensure the TLS secret is present by running: kubectl get secret newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Ensure the CA bundle is present in the mutating webhook configuration: kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg -o json Copy Ensure the TargetPort of the Service resource matches the Port of the Deployment's container: kubectl describe service/newrelic-metadata-injection-svc kubectl describe deployment/newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment Copy",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

For more information, see this New Relic blog post. You can quickly start monitoring Kubernetes clusters using Auto-telemetry with Pixie, which is currently a beta release. This Pixie integration into New Relic does not require a language agent. Learn more about Auto-telemetry with Pixie here. Tip Our Kubernetes metadata injection project is open source. Here's the code to link APM and infrastructure data and the code to automatically manage certificates. Compatibility and requirements Before linking Kubernetes metadata to your APM agents, make sure you meet the following requirements: Kubernetes requirements Network requirements APM agent compatibility OpenShift requirements Kubernetes requirements To link your applications and Kubernetes, your cluster must have the MutatingAdmissionWebhook controller enabled, which requires Kubernetes 1.9 or higher. To verify that your cluster is compatible, run the following command: kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 Copy If you see a different result, follow the Kubernetes documentation to enable admission control in your cluster. Network requirements For Kubernetes to speak to our MutatingAdmissionWebhook, the master node (or the API server container, depending on how the cluster is set up) should be allowed egress for HTTPS traffic on port 443 to pods in all of the other nodes in the cluster. This might require specific configuration depending on how the infrastructure is set up (on-premises, AWS, Google Cloud, etc). Tip Until Kubernetes v1.14, users were only allowed to register admission webhooks on port 443. Since v1.15 it's possible to register them on different ports. To ensure backward compatibility, the webhook is registered by default on port 443 in the YAML config file we distribute. APM agent compatibility The following New Relic agents collect Kubernetes metadata: Go 2.3.0 or higher Java 4.10.0 or higher Node.js 5.3.0 or higher Python 4.14.0 or higher Ruby 6.1.0 or higher .NET 8.17.438 or higher Openshift requirements To link Openshift and Kubernetes you must enable mutating admission webhooks, which requires Openshift 3.9 or higher. During the process, install a resource that requires admin permissions to the cluster. Run this to log in as admin: oc login -u system:admin Copy Check that webhooks are correctly configured. If they are not, update the master-config.yaml file. admissionConfig: pluginConfig: MutatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission ValidatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission location: \"\" Copy Important Add kubeConfigFile: /dev/null to address some issues in Openshift. Enable certificate signing by editing the YAML file and updating your configuration: kubernetesMasterConfig: controllerArguments: cluster-signing-cert-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.crt\" cluster-signing-key-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.key\" Copy Restart the Openshift services in the master node. Configure the injection of metadata By default, all the pods you create that include APM agents have the correct environment variables set and the metadata injection applies to the entire cluster. To check that the environment variables have been set, any container that is running must be stopped, and a new instance started (see Validate the injection of metadata). This default configuration also uses the Kubernetes certificates API to automatically manage the certificates required for the injection. If needed, you can limit the injection of metadata to specific namespaces in your cluster or self-manage your certificates. Default configuration To proceed with the default injection of metadata, follow these steps: Download the YAML file: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Custom configuration You can limit the injection of metadata only to specific namespaces by using labels. To enable this feature, edit your YAML file by finding and uncommenting the following lines: # namespaceSelector: # matchLabels: # newrelic-metadata-injection: enabled Copy With this option, injection is only applied to those namespaces that have the newrelic-metadata-injection label set to enabled: kubectl label namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE newrelic-metadata-injection=enabled Copy Manage custom certificates To use custom certificates you need a specific YAML file: Download the YAML file without automatic certificate management: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Once you have the correct YAML file, you can proceed with the custom certificate management option. You need your certificate, server key, and Certification Authority (CA) bundle encoded in PEM format. If you have them in the standard certificate format (X.509), install openssl, and run the following: openssl x509 -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out CERTIFICATE_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in SERVER_KEY_FILENAME -outform PEM -out SERVER_KEY_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in CA_BUNDLE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out BUNDLE_FILENAME.pem Copy If your certificate/key pair are in another format, see the Digicert knowledgebase for more help. Create the TLS secret with the signed certificate/key pair, and patch the mutating webhook configuration with the CA using the following commands: kubectl create secret tls newrelic-metadata-injection-secret \\ --key=PEM_ENCODED_SERVER_KEY \\ --cert=PEM_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE \\ --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl -n default apply -f - caBundle=$(cat PEM_ENCODED_CA_BUNDLE | base64 | td -d '\\n') kubectl patch mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg --type='json' -p \"[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle', 'value':'${caBundle}'}]\" Copy Important Certificates signed by Kubernetes have an expiration of one year. For more information, see the Kubernetes source code in GitHub. Validate the injection of metadata In order to validate that the webhook (responsible for injecting the metadata) was installed correctly, deploy a new pod and check for the New Relic environment variables. Create a dummy pod containing Busybox by running: kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Check if New Relic environment variables were injected: kubectl exec busybox0 -- env | grep NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME=fsi NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME=nodea NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME=default NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME=busybox0 NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME=busybox Copy Disable the injection of metadata To disable/uninstall the injection of metadata, use the following commands: Delete the Kubernetes objects using the yaml file: kubectl delete -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Delete the TLS secret containing the certificate/key pair: kubectl delete secret/newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Troubleshooting Follow these troubleshooting tips as needed. No Kubernetes metadata in APM or distributed tracing transactions Problem The creation of the secret by the k8s-webhook-cert-manager job used to fail due to the kubectl version used by the image when running in Kubernetes version 1.19.x, The new version 1.3.2 fixes this issue, therefore it is enough to run again the job using an update version of the image to fix the issue. Solution Update the image k8s-webhook-cert-manager (to a version >= 1.3.2) and re-run the job. The secret will be correctly created and the k8s-metadata-injection pod will be able to start. Note that the new version of the manifest and of the nri-bundle are already updated with the correct version of the image. Problem In OpenShift version 4.x, the CA that is used in order to patch the mutatingwebhookconfiguration resource is not the one used when signing the certificates. This is a known issue currently tracked here. In the logs of the Pod nri-metadata-injection, you'll see the following error message: TLS handshake error from 10.131.0.29:37428: remote error: tls: unknown certificate authority TLS handshake error from 10.129.0.1:49314: remote error: tls: bad certificate Copy Workaround Manually update the certificate stored in the mutatingwebhookconfiguration object. The correct CA locations might change according to the cluster configuration. However, you can usually find the CA in the secret csr-signer in the namespace openshift-kube-controller-manager. Problem There is no Kubernetes metadata included in the transactions' attributes of your APM agent or in distributed tracing. Solution Verify that the environment variables are being correctly injected by following the instructions described in the Validate your installation step. If they are not present, get the name of the metadata injection pod by running: kubectl get pods | grep newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment kubectl logs -f pod/podname Copy In another terminal, create a new pod (for example, see Validate your installation), and inspect the logs of the metadata injection deployment for errors. For every created pod there should be a set of 4 new entries in the logs like: {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.107Z\",\"caller\":\"server/main.go:139\",\"msg\":\"POST https://newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default.svc:443/mutate?timeout=30s HTTP/2.0\\\" from 10.11.49.2:32836\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.110Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:168\",\"msg\":\"received admission review\",\"kind\":\"/v1, Kind=Pod\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"name\":\"\",\"pod\":\"busybox1\",\"UID\":\"6577519b-7a61-11ea-965e-0e46d1c9335c\",\"operation\":\"CREATE\",\"userinfo\":{\"username\":\"admin\",\"uid\":\"admin\",\"groups\":[\"system:masters\",\"system:authenticated\"]}} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:182\",\"msg\":\"admission response created\",\"response\":\"[{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env\\\",\\\"value\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"adn_kops\\\"}]},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"spec.nodeName\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.namespace\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.name\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}}]\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:257\",\"msg\":\"writing response\"} Copy If there are no new entries on the logs, it means that the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook service, this could be due to networking rules or security groups rejecting the communication. To check if the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook you should inspect the apiserver logs for errors like: failed calling webhook \"metadata-injection.newrelic.com\": ERROR_REASON Copy To get the apiserver logs: Start a proxy to the Kubernetes API server by the executing the following command in a terminal window and keep it running. kubectl proxy --port=8001 Copy Create a new pod in your cluster, this will make the apiserver try to communicate with the webhook. The following command will create a busybox. kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Retrieve the apiserver logs. curl localhost:8001/logs/kube-apiserver.log > apiserver.log Copy Delete the busybox container. kubectl delete -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Inspect the logs for errors. grep -E 'failed calling webhook' apiserver.log Copy Remember that one of the requirements for the metadata injection is that the apiserver must be allowed egress to the pods running on the cluster. If you encounter errors regarding connection timeouts or failed connections, make sure to check the security groups and firewall rules of the cluster. If there are no log entries in either the apiserver logs or the metadata injection deployment, it means that the webhook was not properly registered. Ensure the metadata injection setup job ran successfully by inspecting the output of: kubectl get job newrelic-metadata-setup Copy If the job is not completed, investigate the logs of the setup job: kubectl logs job/newrelic-metadata-setup Copy Ensure the CertificateSigningRequest is approved and issued by running: kubectl get csr newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default Copy Ensure the TLS secret is present by running: kubectl get secret newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Ensure the CA bundle is present in the mutating webhook configuration: kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg -o json Copy Ensure the TargetPort of the Service resource matches the Port of the Deployment's container: kubectl describe service/newrelic-metadata-injection-svc kubectl describe deployment/newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment Copy",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "You can surface Kubernetes metadata and link it to your APM agents as distributed traces to explore performance issues and troubleshoot transaction errors. For more information, see this New Relic blog post. You can quickly start monitoring Kubernetes clusters using Auto-telemetry with Pixie, which is currently a beta release. This Pixie integration into New Relic does not require a language agent. Learn more about Auto-telemetry with Pixie here. Tip Our Kubernetes metadata injection project is open source. Here's the code to link APM and infrastructure data and the code to automatically manage certificates. Compatibility and requirements Before linking Kubernetes metadata to your APM agents, make sure you meet the following requirements: Kubernetes requirements Network requirements APM agent compatibility OpenShift requirements Kubernetes requirements To link your applications and Kubernetes, your cluster must have the MutatingAdmissionWebhook controller enabled, which requires Kubernetes 1.9 or higher. To verify that your cluster is compatible, run the following command: kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 Copy If you see a different result, follow the Kubernetes documentation to enable admission control in your cluster. Network requirements For Kubernetes to speak to our MutatingAdmissionWebhook, the master node (or the API server container, depending on how the cluster is set up) should be allowed egress for HTTPS traffic on port 443 to pods in all of the other nodes in the cluster. This might require specific configuration depending on how the infrastructure is set up (on-premises, AWS, Google Cloud, etc). Tip Until Kubernetes v1.14, users were only allowed to register admission webhooks on port 443. Since v1.15 it's possible to register them on different ports. To ensure backward compatibility, the webhook is registered by default on port 443 in the YAML config file we distribute. APM agent compatibility The following New Relic agents collect Kubernetes metadata: Go 2.3.0 or higher Java 4.10.0 or higher Node.js 5.3.0 or higher Python 4.14.0 or higher Ruby 6.1.0 or higher .NET 8.17.438 or higher Openshift requirements To link Openshift and Kubernetes you must enable mutating admission webhooks, which requires Openshift 3.9 or higher. During the process, install a resource that requires admin permissions to the cluster. Run this to log in as admin: oc login -u system:admin Copy Check that webhooks are correctly configured. If they are not, update the master-config.yaml file. admissionConfig: pluginConfig: MutatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission ValidatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission location: \"\" Copy Important Add kubeConfigFile: /dev/null to address some issues in Openshift. Enable certificate signing by editing the YAML file and updating your configuration: kubernetesMasterConfig: controllerArguments: cluster-signing-cert-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.crt\" cluster-signing-key-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.key\" Copy Restart the Openshift services in the master node. Configure the injection of metadata By default, all the pods you create that include APM agents have the correct environment variables set and the metadata injection applies to the entire cluster. To check that the environment variables have been set, any container that is running must be stopped, and a new instance started (see Validate the injection of metadata). This default configuration also uses the Kubernetes certificates API to automatically manage the certificates required for the injection. If needed, you can limit the injection of metadata to specific namespaces in your cluster or self-manage your certificates. Default configuration To proceed with the default injection of metadata, follow these steps: Download the YAML file: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Custom configuration You can limit the injection of metadata only to specific namespaces by using labels. To enable this feature, edit your YAML file by finding and uncommenting the following lines: # namespaceSelector: # matchLabels: # newrelic-metadata-injection: enabled Copy With this option, injection is only applied to those namespaces that have the newrelic-metadata-injection label set to enabled: kubectl label namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE newrelic-metadata-injection=enabled Copy Manage custom certificates To use custom certificates you need a specific YAML file: Download the YAML file without automatic certificate management: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Once you have the correct YAML file, you can proceed with the custom certificate management option. You need your certificate, server key, and Certification Authority (CA) bundle encoded in PEM format. If you have them in the standard certificate format (X.509), install openssl, and run the following: openssl x509 -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out CERTIFICATE_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in SERVER_KEY_FILENAME -outform PEM -out SERVER_KEY_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in CA_BUNDLE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out BUNDLE_FILENAME.pem Copy If your certificate/key pair are in another format, see the Digicert knowledgebase for more help. Create the TLS secret with the signed certificate/key pair, and patch the mutating webhook configuration with the CA using the following commands: kubectl create secret tls newrelic-metadata-injection-secret \\ --key=PEM_ENCODED_SERVER_KEY \\ --cert=PEM_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE \\ --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl -n default apply -f - caBundle=$(cat PEM_ENCODED_CA_BUNDLE | base64 | td -d '\\n') kubectl patch mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg --type='json' -p \"[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle', 'value':'${caBundle}'}]\" Copy Important Certificates signed by Kubernetes have an expiration of one year. For more information, see the Kubernetes source code in GitHub. Validate the injection of metadata In order to validate that the webhook (responsible for injecting the metadata) was installed correctly, deploy a new pod and check for the New Relic environment variables. Create a dummy pod containing Busybox by running: kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Check if New Relic environment variables were injected: kubectl exec busybox0 -- env | grep NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME=fsi NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME=nodea NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME=default NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME=busybox0 NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME=busybox Copy Disable the injection of metadata To disable/uninstall the injection of metadata, use the following commands: Delete the Kubernetes objects using the yaml file: kubectl delete -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Delete the TLS secret containing the certificate/key pair: kubectl delete secret/newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Troubleshooting Follow these troubleshooting tips as needed. No Kubernetes metadata in APM or distributed tracing transactions Problem The creation of the secret by the k8s-webhook-cert-manager job used to fail due to the kubectl version used by the image when running in Kubernetes version 1.19.x, The new version 1.3.2 fixes this issue, therefore it is enough to run again the job using an update version of the image to fix the issue. Solution Update the image k8s-webhook-cert-manager (to a version >= 1.3.2) and re-run the job. The secret will be correctly created and the k8s-metadata-injection pod will be able to start. Note that the new version of the manifest and of the nri-bundle are already updated with the correct version of the image. Problem In OpenShift version 4.x, the CA that is used in order to patch the mutatingwebhookconfiguration resource is not the one used when signing the certificates. This is a known issue currently tracked here. In the logs of the Pod nri-metadata-injection, you'll see the following error message: TLS handshake error from 10.131.0.29:37428: remote error: tls: unknown certificate authority TLS handshake error from 10.129.0.1:49314: remote error: tls: bad certificate Copy Workaround Manually update the certificate stored in the mutatingwebhookconfiguration object. The correct CA locations might change according to the cluster configuration. However, you can usually find the CA in the secret csr-signer in the namespace openshift-kube-controller-manager. Problem There is no Kubernetes metadata included in the transactions' attributes of your APM agent or in distributed tracing. Solution Verify that the environment variables are being correctly injected by following the instructions described in the Validate your installation step. If they are not present, get the name of the metadata injection pod by running: kubectl get pods | grep newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment kubectl logs -f pod/podname Copy In another terminal, create a new pod (for example, see Validate your installation), and inspect the logs of the metadata injection deployment for errors. For every created pod there should be a set of 4 new entries in the logs like: {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.107Z\",\"caller\":\"server/main.go:139\",\"msg\":\"POST https://newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default.svc:443/mutate?timeout=30s HTTP/2.0\\\" from 10.11.49.2:32836\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.110Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:168\",\"msg\":\"received admission review\",\"kind\":\"/v1, Kind=Pod\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"name\":\"\",\"pod\":\"busybox1\",\"UID\":\"6577519b-7a61-11ea-965e-0e46d1c9335c\",\"operation\":\"CREATE\",\"userinfo\":{\"username\":\"admin\",\"uid\":\"admin\",\"groups\":[\"system:masters\",\"system:authenticated\"]}} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:182\",\"msg\":\"admission response created\",\"response\":\"[{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env\\\",\\\"value\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"adn_kops\\\"}]},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"spec.nodeName\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.namespace\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.name\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}}]\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:257\",\"msg\":\"writing response\"} Copy If there are no new entries on the logs, it means that the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook service, this could be due to networking rules or security groups rejecting the communication. To check if the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook you should inspect the apiserver logs for errors like: failed calling webhook \"metadata-injection.newrelic.com\": ERROR_REASON Copy To get the apiserver logs: Start a proxy to the Kubernetes API server by the executing the following command in a terminal window and keep it running. kubectl proxy --port=8001 Copy Create a new pod in your cluster, this will make the apiserver try to communicate with the webhook. The following command will create a busybox. kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Retrieve the apiserver logs. curl localhost:8001/logs/kube-apiserver.log > apiserver.log Copy Delete the busybox container. kubectl delete -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Inspect the logs for errors. grep -E 'failed calling webhook' apiserver.log Copy Remember that one of the requirements for the metadata injection is that the apiserver must be allowed egress to the pods running on the cluster. If you encounter errors regarding connection timeouts or failed connections, make sure to check the security groups and firewall rules of the cluster. If there are no log entries in either the apiserver logs or the metadata injection deployment, it means that the webhook was not properly registered. Ensure the metadata injection setup job ran successfully by inspecting the output of: kubectl get job newrelic-metadata-setup Copy If the job is not completed, investigate the logs of the setup job: kubectl logs job/newrelic-metadata-setup Copy Ensure the CertificateSigningRequest is approved and issued by running: kubectl get csr newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default Copy Ensure the TLS secret is present by running: kubectl get secret newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Ensure the CA bundle is present in the mutating webhook configuration: kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg -o json Copy Ensure the TargetPort of the Service resource matches the Port of the Deployment's container: kubectl describe service/newrelic-metadata-injection-svc kubectl describe deployment/newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment Copy",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

For more information, see this New Relic blog post. You can quickly start monitoring Kubernetes clusters using Auto-telemetry with Pixie, which is currently a beta release. This Pixie integration into New Relic does not require a language agent. Learn more about Auto-telemetry with Pixie here. Tip Our Kubernetes metadata injection project is open source. Here's the code to link APM and infrastructure data and the code to automatically manage certificates. Compatibility and requirements Before linking Kubernetes metadata to your APM agents, make sure you meet the following requirements: Kubernetes requirements Network requirements APM agent compatibility OpenShift requirements Kubernetes requirements To link your applications and Kubernetes, your cluster must have the MutatingAdmissionWebhook controller enabled, which requires Kubernetes 1.9 or higher. To verify that your cluster is compatible, run the following command: kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 Copy If you see a different result, follow the Kubernetes documentation to enable admission control in your cluster. Network requirements For Kubernetes to speak to our MutatingAdmissionWebhook, the master node (or the API server container, depending on how the cluster is set up) should be allowed egress for HTTPS traffic on port 443 to pods in all of the other nodes in the cluster. This might require specific configuration depending on how the infrastructure is set up (on-premises, AWS, Google Cloud, etc). Tip Until Kubernetes v1.14, users were only allowed to register admission webhooks on port 443. Since v1.15 it's possible to register them on different ports. To ensure backward compatibility, the webhook is registered by default on port 443 in the YAML config file we distribute. APM agent compatibility The following New Relic agents collect Kubernetes metadata: Go 2.3.0 or higher Java 4.10.0 or higher Node.js 5.3.0 or higher Python 4.14.0 or higher Ruby 6.1.0 or higher .NET 8.17.438 or higher Openshift requirements To link Openshift and Kubernetes you must enable mutating admission webhooks, which requires Openshift 3.9 or higher. During the process, install a resource that requires admin permissions to the cluster. Run this to log in as admin: oc login -u system:admin Copy Check that webhooks are correctly configured. If they are not, update the master-config.yaml file. admissionConfig: pluginConfig: MutatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission ValidatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission location: \"\" Copy Important Add kubeConfigFile: /dev/null to address some issues in Openshift. Enable certificate signing by editing the YAML file and updating your configuration: kubernetesMasterConfig: controllerArguments: cluster-signing-cert-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.crt\" cluster-signing-key-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.key\" Copy Restart the Openshift services in the master node. Configure the injection of metadata By default, all the pods you create that include APM agents have the correct environment variables set and the metadata injection applies to the entire cluster. To check that the environment variables have been set, any container that is running must be stopped, and a new instance started (see Validate the injection of metadata). This default configuration also uses the Kubernetes certificates API to automatically manage the certificates required for the injection. If needed, you can limit the injection of metadata to specific namespaces in your cluster or self-manage your certificates. Default configuration To proceed with the default injection of metadata, follow these steps: Download the YAML file: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Custom configuration You can limit the injection of metadata only to specific namespaces by using labels. To enable this feature, edit your YAML file by finding and uncommenting the following lines: # namespaceSelector: # matchLabels: # newrelic-metadata-injection: enabled Copy With this option, injection is only applied to those namespaces that have the newrelic-metadata-injection label set to enabled: kubectl label namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE newrelic-metadata-injection=enabled Copy Manage custom certificates To use custom certificates you need a specific YAML file: Download the YAML file without automatic certificate management: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Once you have the correct YAML file, you can proceed with the custom certificate management option. You need your certificate, server key, and Certification Authority (CA) bundle encoded in PEM format. If you have them in the standard certificate format (X.509), install openssl, and run the following: openssl x509 -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out CERTIFICATE_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in SERVER_KEY_FILENAME -outform PEM -out SERVER_KEY_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in CA_BUNDLE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out BUNDLE_FILENAME.pem Copy If your certificate/key pair are in another format, see the Digicert knowledgebase for more help. Create the TLS secret with the signed certificate/key pair, and patch the mutating webhook configuration with the CA using the following commands: kubectl create secret tls newrelic-metadata-injection-secret \\ --key=PEM_ENCODED_SERVER_KEY \\ --cert=PEM_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE \\ --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl -n default apply -f - caBundle=$(cat PEM_ENCODED_CA_BUNDLE | base64 | td -d '\\n') kubectl patch mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg --type='json' -p \"[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle', 'value':'${caBundle}'}]\" Copy Important Certificates signed by Kubernetes have an expiration of one year. For more information, see the Kubernetes source code in GitHub. Validate the injection of metadata In order to validate that the webhook (responsible for injecting the metadata) was installed correctly, deploy a new pod and check for the New Relic environment variables. Create a dummy pod containing Busybox by running: kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Check if New Relic environment variables were injected: kubectl exec busybox0 -- env | grep NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME=fsi NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME=nodea NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME=default NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME=busybox0 NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME=busybox Copy Disable the injection of metadata To disable/uninstall the injection of metadata, use the following commands: Delete the Kubernetes objects using the yaml file: kubectl delete -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Delete the TLS secret containing the certificate/key pair: kubectl delete secret/newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Troubleshooting Follow these troubleshooting tips as needed. No Kubernetes metadata in APM or distributed tracing transactions Problem The creation of the secret by the k8s-webhook-cert-manager job used to fail due to the kubectl version used by the image when running in Kubernetes version 1.19.x, The new version 1.3.2 fixes this issue, therefore it is enough to run again the job using an update version of the image to fix the issue. Solution Update the image k8s-webhook-cert-manager (to a version >= 1.3.2) and re-run the job. The secret will be correctly created and the k8s-metadata-injection pod will be able to start. Note that the new version of the manifest and of the nri-bundle are already updated with the correct version of the image. Problem In OpenShift version 4.x, the CA that is used in order to patch the mutatingwebhookconfiguration resource is not the one used when signing the certificates. This is a known issue currently tracked here. In the logs of the Pod nri-metadata-injection, you'll see the following error message: TLS handshake error from 10.131.0.29:37428: remote error: tls: unknown certificate authority TLS handshake error from 10.129.0.1:49314: remote error: tls: bad certificate Copy Workaround Manually update the certificate stored in the mutatingwebhookconfiguration object. The correct CA locations might change according to the cluster configuration. However, you can usually find the CA in the secret csr-signer in the namespace openshift-kube-controller-manager. Problem There is no Kubernetes metadata included in the transactions' attributes of your APM agent or in distributed tracing. Solution Verify that the environment variables are being correctly injected by following the instructions described in the Validate your installation step. If they are not present, get the name of the metadata injection pod by running: kubectl get pods | grep newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment kubectl logs -f pod/podname Copy In another terminal, create a new pod (for example, see Validate your installation), and inspect the logs of the metadata injection deployment for errors. For every created pod there should be a set of 4 new entries in the logs like: {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.107Z\",\"caller\":\"server/main.go:139\",\"msg\":\"POST https://newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default.svc:443/mutate?timeout=30s HTTP/2.0\\\" from 10.11.49.2:32836\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.110Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:168\",\"msg\":\"received admission review\",\"kind\":\"/v1, Kind=Pod\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"name\":\"\",\"pod\":\"busybox1\",\"UID\":\"6577519b-7a61-11ea-965e-0e46d1c9335c\",\"operation\":\"CREATE\",\"userinfo\":{\"username\":\"admin\",\"uid\":\"admin\",\"groups\":[\"system:masters\",\"system:authenticated\"]}} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:182\",\"msg\":\"admission response created\",\"response\":\"[{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env\\\",\\\"value\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"adn_kops\\\"}]},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"spec.nodeName\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.namespace\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.name\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}}]\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:257\",\"msg\":\"writing response\"} Copy If there are no new entries on the logs, it means that the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook service, this could be due to networking rules or security groups rejecting the communication. To check if the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook you should inspect the apiserver logs for errors like: failed calling webhook \"metadata-injection.newrelic.com\": ERROR_REASON Copy To get the apiserver logs: Start a proxy to the Kubernetes API server by the executing the following command in a terminal window and keep it running. kubectl proxy --port=8001 Copy Create a new pod in your cluster, this will make the apiserver try to communicate with the webhook. The following command will create a busybox. kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Retrieve the apiserver logs. curl localhost:8001/logs/kube-apiserver.log > apiserver.log Copy Delete the busybox container. kubectl delete -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Inspect the logs for errors. grep -E 'failed calling webhook' apiserver.log Copy Remember that one of the requirements for the metadata injection is that the apiserver must be allowed egress to the pods running on the cluster. If you encounter errors regarding connection timeouts or failed connections, make sure to check the security groups and firewall rules of the cluster. If there are no log entries in either the apiserver logs or the metadata injection deployment, it means that the webhook was not properly registered. Ensure the metadata injection setup job ran successfully by inspecting the output of: kubectl get job newrelic-metadata-setup Copy If the job is not completed, investigate the logs of the setup job: kubectl logs job/newrelic-metadata-setup Copy Ensure the CertificateSigningRequest is approved and issued by running: kubectl get csr newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default Copy Ensure the TLS secret is present by running: kubectl get secret newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Ensure the CA bundle is present in the mutating webhook configuration: kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg -o json Copy Ensure the TargetPort of the Service resource matches the Port of the Deployment's container: kubectl describe service/newrelic-metadata-injection-svc kubectl describe deployment/newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment Copy",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "You can surface Kubernetes metadata and link it to your APM agents as distributed traces to explore performance issues and troubleshoot transaction errors. For more information, see this New Relic blog post. You can quickly start monitoring Kubernetes clusters using Auto-telemetry with Pixie, which is currently a beta release. This Pixie integration into New Relic does not require a language agent. Learn more about Auto-telemetry with Pixie here. Tip Our Kubernetes metadata injection project is open source. Here's the code to link APM and infrastructure data and the code to automatically manage certificates. Compatibility and requirements Before linking Kubernetes metadata to your APM agents, make sure you meet the following requirements: Kubernetes requirements Network requirements APM agent compatibility OpenShift requirements Kubernetes requirements To link your applications and Kubernetes, your cluster must have the MutatingAdmissionWebhook controller enabled, which requires Kubernetes 1.9 or higher. To verify that your cluster is compatible, run the following command: kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 Copy If you see a different result, follow the Kubernetes documentation to enable admission control in your cluster. Network requirements For Kubernetes to speak to our MutatingAdmissionWebhook, the master node (or the API server container, depending on how the cluster is set up) should be allowed egress for HTTPS traffic on port 443 to pods in all of the other nodes in the cluster. This might require specific configuration depending on how the infrastructure is set up (on-premises, AWS, Google Cloud, etc). Tip Until Kubernetes v1.14, users were only allowed to register admission webhooks on port 443. Since v1.15 it's possible to register them on different ports. To ensure backward compatibility, the webhook is registered by default on port 443 in the YAML config file we distribute. APM agent compatibility The following New Relic agents collect Kubernetes metadata: Go 2.3.0 or higher Java 4.10.0 or higher Node.js 5.3.0 or higher Python 4.14.0 or higher Ruby 6.1.0 or higher .NET 8.17.438 or higher Openshift requirements To link Openshift and Kubernetes you must enable mutating admission webhooks, which requires Openshift 3.9 or higher. During the process, install a resource that requires admin permissions to the cluster. Run this to log in as admin: oc login -u system:admin Copy Check that webhooks are correctly configured. If they are not, update the master-config.yaml file. admissionConfig: pluginConfig: MutatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission ValidatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission location: \"\" Copy Important Add kubeConfigFile: /dev/null to address some issues in Openshift. Enable certificate signing by editing the YAML file and updating your configuration: kubernetesMasterConfig: controllerArguments: cluster-signing-cert-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.crt\" cluster-signing-key-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.key\" Copy Restart the Openshift services in the master node. Configure the injection of metadata By default, all the pods you create that include APM agents have the correct environment variables set and the metadata injection applies to the entire cluster. To check that the environment variables have been set, any container that is running must be stopped, and a new instance started (see Validate the injection of metadata). This default configuration also uses the Kubernetes certificates API to automatically manage the certificates required for the injection. If needed, you can limit the injection of metadata to specific namespaces in your cluster or self-manage your certificates. Default configuration To proceed with the default injection of metadata, follow these steps: Download the YAML file: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Custom configuration You can limit the injection of metadata only to specific namespaces by using labels. To enable this feature, edit your YAML file by finding and uncommenting the following lines: # namespaceSelector: # matchLabels: # newrelic-metadata-injection: enabled Copy With this option, injection is only applied to those namespaces that have the newrelic-metadata-injection label set to enabled: kubectl label namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE newrelic-metadata-injection=enabled Copy Manage custom certificates To use custom certificates you need a specific YAML file: Download the YAML file without automatic certificate management: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Once you have the correct YAML file, you can proceed with the custom certificate management option. You need your certificate, server key, and Certification Authority (CA) bundle encoded in PEM format. If you have them in the standard certificate format (X.509), install openssl, and run the following: openssl x509 -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out CERTIFICATE_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in SERVER_KEY_FILENAME -outform PEM -out SERVER_KEY_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in CA_BUNDLE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out BUNDLE_FILENAME.pem Copy If your certificate/key pair are in another format, see the Digicert knowledgebase for more help. Create the TLS secret with the signed certificate/key pair, and patch the mutating webhook configuration with the CA using the following commands: kubectl create secret tls newrelic-metadata-injection-secret \\ --key=PEM_ENCODED_SERVER_KEY \\ --cert=PEM_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE \\ --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl -n default apply -f - caBundle=$(cat PEM_ENCODED_CA_BUNDLE | base64 | td -d '\\n') kubectl patch mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg --type='json' -p \"[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle', 'value':'${caBundle}'}]\" Copy Important Certificates signed by Kubernetes have an expiration of one year. For more information, see the Kubernetes source code in GitHub. Validate the injection of metadata In order to validate that the webhook (responsible for injecting the metadata) was installed correctly, deploy a new pod and check for the New Relic environment variables. Create a dummy pod containing Busybox by running: kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Check if New Relic environment variables were injected: kubectl exec busybox0 -- env | grep NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME=fsi NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME=nodea NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME=default NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME=busybox0 NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME=busybox Copy Disable the injection of metadata To disable/uninstall the injection of metadata, use the following commands: Delete the Kubernetes objects using the yaml file: kubectl delete -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Delete the TLS secret containing the certificate/key pair: kubectl delete secret/newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Troubleshooting Follow these troubleshooting tips as needed. No Kubernetes metadata in APM or distributed tracing transactions Problem The creation of the secret by the k8s-webhook-cert-manager job used to fail due to the kubectl version used by the image when running in Kubernetes version 1.19.x, The new version 1.3.2 fixes this issue, therefore it is enough to run again the job using an update version of the image to fix the issue. Solution Update the image k8s-webhook-cert-manager (to a version >= 1.3.2) and re-run the job. The secret will be correctly created and the k8s-metadata-injection pod will be able to start. Note that the new version of the manifest and of the nri-bundle are already updated with the correct version of the image. Problem In OpenShift version 4.x, the CA that is used in order to patch the mutatingwebhookconfiguration resource is not the one used when signing the certificates. This is a known issue currently tracked here. In the logs of the Pod nri-metadata-injection, you'll see the following error message: TLS handshake error from 10.131.0.29:37428: remote error: tls: unknown certificate authority TLS handshake error from 10.129.0.1:49314: remote error: tls: bad certificate Copy Workaround Manually update the certificate stored in the mutatingwebhookconfiguration object. The correct CA locations might change according to the cluster configuration. However, you can usually find the CA in the secret csr-signer in the namespace openshift-kube-controller-manager. Problem There is no Kubernetes metadata included in the transactions' attributes of your APM agent or in distributed tracing. Solution Verify that the environment variables are being correctly injected by following the instructions described in the Validate your installation step. If they are not present, get the name of the metadata injection pod by running: kubectl get pods | grep newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment kubectl logs -f pod/podname Copy In another terminal, create a new pod (for example, see Validate your installation), and inspect the logs of the metadata injection deployment for errors. For every created pod there should be a set of 4 new entries in the logs like: {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.107Z\",\"caller\":\"server/main.go:139\",\"msg\":\"POST https://newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default.svc:443/mutate?timeout=30s HTTP/2.0\\\" from 10.11.49.2:32836\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.110Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:168\",\"msg\":\"received admission review\",\"kind\":\"/v1, Kind=Pod\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"name\":\"\",\"pod\":\"busybox1\",\"UID\":\"6577519b-7a61-11ea-965e-0e46d1c9335c\",\"operation\":\"CREATE\",\"userinfo\":{\"username\":\"admin\",\"uid\":\"admin\",\"groups\":[\"system:masters\",\"system:authenticated\"]}} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:182\",\"msg\":\"admission response created\",\"response\":\"[{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env\\\",\\\"value\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"adn_kops\\\"}]},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"spec.nodeName\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.namespace\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.name\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}}]\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:257\",\"msg\":\"writing response\"} Copy If there are no new entries on the logs, it means that the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook service, this could be due to networking rules or security groups rejecting the communication. To check if the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook you should inspect the apiserver logs for errors like: failed calling webhook \"metadata-injection.newrelic.com\": ERROR_REASON Copy To get the apiserver logs: Start a proxy to the Kubernetes API server by the executing the following command in a terminal window and keep it running. kubectl proxy --port=8001 Copy Create a new pod in your cluster, this will make the apiserver try to communicate with the webhook. The following command will create a busybox. kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Retrieve the apiserver logs. curl localhost:8001/logs/kube-apiserver.log > apiserver.log Copy Delete the busybox container. kubectl delete -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Inspect the logs for errors. grep -E 'failed calling webhook' apiserver.log Copy Remember that one of the requirements for the metadata injection is that the apiserver must be allowed egress to the pods running on the cluster. If you encounter errors regarding connection timeouts or failed connections, make sure to check the security groups and firewall rules of the cluster. If there are no log entries in either the apiserver logs or the metadata injection deployment, it means that the webhook was not properly registered. Ensure the metadata injection setup job ran successfully by inspecting the output of: kubectl get job newrelic-metadata-setup Copy If the job is not completed, investigate the logs of the setup job: kubectl logs job/newrelic-metadata-setup Copy Ensure the CertificateSigningRequest is approved and issued by running: kubectl get csr newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default Copy Ensure the TLS secret is present by running: kubectl get secret newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Ensure the CA bundle is present in the mutating webhook configuration: kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg -o json Copy Ensure the TargetPort of the Service resource matches the Port of the Deployment's container: kubectl describe service/newrelic-metadata-injection-svc kubectl describe deployment/newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment Copy",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

For more information, see this New Relic blog post. You can quickly start monitoring Kubernetes clusters using Auto-telemetry with Pixie, which is currently a beta release. This Pixie integration into New Relic does not require a language agent. Learn more about Auto-telemetry with Pixie here. Tip Our Kubernetes metadata injection project is open source. Here's the code to link APM and infrastructure data and the code to automatically manage certificates. Compatibility and requirements Before linking Kubernetes metadata to your APM agents, make sure you meet the following requirements: Kubernetes requirements Network requirements APM agent compatibility OpenShift requirements Kubernetes requirements To link your applications and Kubernetes, your cluster must have the MutatingAdmissionWebhook controller enabled, which requires Kubernetes 1.9 or higher. To verify that your cluster is compatible, run the following command: kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 Copy If you see a different result, follow the Kubernetes documentation to enable admission control in your cluster. Network requirements For Kubernetes to speak to our MutatingAdmissionWebhook, the master node (or the API server container, depending on how the cluster is set up) should be allowed egress for HTTPS traffic on port 443 to pods in all of the other nodes in the cluster. This might require specific configuration depending on how the infrastructure is set up (on-premises, AWS, Google Cloud, etc). Tip Until Kubernetes v1.14, users were only allowed to register admission webhooks on port 443. Since v1.15 it's possible to register them on different ports. To ensure backward compatibility, the webhook is registered by default on port 443 in the YAML config file we distribute. APM agent compatibility The following New Relic agents collect Kubernetes metadata: Go 2.3.0 or higher Java 4.10.0 or higher Node.js 5.3.0 or higher Python 4.14.0 or higher Ruby 6.1.0 or higher .NET 8.17.438 or higher Openshift requirements To link Openshift and Kubernetes you must enable mutating admission webhooks, which requires Openshift 3.9 or higher. During the process, install a resource that requires admin permissions to the cluster. Run this to log in as admin: oc login -u system:admin Copy Check that webhooks are correctly configured. If they are not, update the master-config.yaml file. admissionConfig: pluginConfig: MutatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission ValidatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission location: \"\" Copy Important Add kubeConfigFile: /dev/null to address some issues in Openshift. Enable certificate signing by editing the YAML file and updating your configuration: kubernetesMasterConfig: controllerArguments: cluster-signing-cert-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.crt\" cluster-signing-key-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.key\" Copy Restart the Openshift services in the master node. Configure the injection of metadata By default, all the pods you create that include APM agents have the correct environment variables set and the metadata injection applies to the entire cluster. To check that the environment variables have been set, any container that is running must be stopped, and a new instance started (see Validate the injection of metadata). This default configuration also uses the Kubernetes certificates API to automatically manage the certificates required for the injection. If needed, you can limit the injection of metadata to specific namespaces in your cluster or self-manage your certificates. Default configuration To proceed with the default injection of metadata, follow these steps: Download the YAML file: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Custom configuration You can limit the injection of metadata only to specific namespaces by using labels. To enable this feature, edit your YAML file by finding and uncommenting the following lines: # namespaceSelector: # matchLabels: # newrelic-metadata-injection: enabled Copy With this option, injection is only applied to those namespaces that have the newrelic-metadata-injection label set to enabled: kubectl label namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE newrelic-metadata-injection=enabled Copy Manage custom certificates To use custom certificates you need a specific YAML file: Download the YAML file without automatic certificate management: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Once you have the correct YAML file, you can proceed with the custom certificate management option. You need your certificate, server key, and Certification Authority (CA) bundle encoded in PEM format. If you have them in the standard certificate format (X.509), install openssl, and run the following: openssl x509 -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out CERTIFICATE_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in SERVER_KEY_FILENAME -outform PEM -out SERVER_KEY_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in CA_BUNDLE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out BUNDLE_FILENAME.pem Copy If your certificate/key pair are in another format, see the Digicert knowledgebase for more help. Create the TLS secret with the signed certificate/key pair, and patch the mutating webhook configuration with the CA using the following commands: kubectl create secret tls newrelic-metadata-injection-secret \\ --key=PEM_ENCODED_SERVER_KEY \\ --cert=PEM_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE \\ --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl -n default apply -f - caBundle=$(cat PEM_ENCODED_CA_BUNDLE | base64 | td -d '\\n') kubectl patch mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg --type='json' -p \"[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle', 'value':'${caBundle}'}]\" Copy Important Certificates signed by Kubernetes have an expiration of one year. For more information, see the Kubernetes source code in GitHub. Validate the injection of metadata In order to validate that the webhook (responsible for injecting the metadata) was installed correctly, deploy a new pod and check for the New Relic environment variables. Create a dummy pod containing Busybox by running: kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Check if New Relic environment variables were injected: kubectl exec busybox0 -- env | grep NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME=fsi NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME=nodea NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME=default NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME=busybox0 NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME=busybox Copy Disable the injection of metadata To disable/uninstall the injection of metadata, use the following commands: Delete the Kubernetes objects using the yaml file: kubectl delete -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Delete the TLS secret containing the certificate/key pair: kubectl delete secret/newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Troubleshooting Follow these troubleshooting tips as needed. No Kubernetes metadata in APM or distributed tracing transactions Problem The creation of the secret by the k8s-webhook-cert-manager job used to fail due to the kubectl version used by the image when running in Kubernetes version 1.19.x, The new version 1.3.2 fixes this issue, therefore it is enough to run again the job using an update version of the image to fix the issue. Solution Update the image k8s-webhook-cert-manager (to a version >= 1.3.2) and re-run the job. The secret will be correctly created and the k8s-metadata-injection pod will be able to start. Note that the new version of the manifest and of the nri-bundle are already updated with the correct version of the image. Problem In OpenShift version 4.x, the CA that is used in order to patch the mutatingwebhookconfiguration resource is not the one used when signing the certificates. This is a known issue currently tracked here. In the logs of the Pod nri-metadata-injection, you'll see the following error message: TLS handshake error from 10.131.0.29:37428: remote error: tls: unknown certificate authority TLS handshake error from 10.129.0.1:49314: remote error: tls: bad certificate Copy Workaround Manually update the certificate stored in the mutatingwebhookconfiguration object. The correct CA locations might change according to the cluster configuration. However, you can usually find the CA in the secret csr-signer in the namespace openshift-kube-controller-manager. Problem There is no Kubernetes metadata included in the transactions' attributes of your APM agent or in distributed tracing. Solution Verify that the environment variables are being correctly injected by following the instructions described in the Validate your installation step. If they are not present, get the name of the metadata injection pod by running: kubectl get pods | grep newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment kubectl logs -f pod/podname Copy In another terminal, create a new pod (for example, see Validate your installation), and inspect the logs of the metadata injection deployment for errors. For every created pod there should be a set of 4 new entries in the logs like: {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.107Z\",\"caller\":\"server/main.go:139\",\"msg\":\"POST https://newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default.svc:443/mutate?timeout=30s HTTP/2.0\\\" from 10.11.49.2:32836\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.110Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:168\",\"msg\":\"received admission review\",\"kind\":\"/v1, Kind=Pod\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"name\":\"\",\"pod\":\"busybox1\",\"UID\":\"6577519b-7a61-11ea-965e-0e46d1c9335c\",\"operation\":\"CREATE\",\"userinfo\":{\"username\":\"admin\",\"uid\":\"admin\",\"groups\":[\"system:masters\",\"system:authenticated\"]}} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:182\",\"msg\":\"admission response created\",\"response\":\"[{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env\\\",\\\"value\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"adn_kops\\\"}]},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"spec.nodeName\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.namespace\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.name\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}}]\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:257\",\"msg\":\"writing response\"} Copy If there are no new entries on the logs, it means that the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook service, this could be due to networking rules or security groups rejecting the communication. To check if the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook you should inspect the apiserver logs for errors like: failed calling webhook \"metadata-injection.newrelic.com\": ERROR_REASON Copy To get the apiserver logs: Start a proxy to the Kubernetes API server by the executing the following command in a terminal window and keep it running. kubectl proxy --port=8001 Copy Create a new pod in your cluster, this will make the apiserver try to communicate with the webhook. The following command will create a busybox. kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Retrieve the apiserver logs. curl localhost:8001/logs/kube-apiserver.log > apiserver.log Copy Delete the busybox container. kubectl delete -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Inspect the logs for errors. grep -E 'failed calling webhook' apiserver.log Copy Remember that one of the requirements for the metadata injection is that the apiserver must be allowed egress to the pods running on the cluster. If you encounter errors regarding connection timeouts or failed connections, make sure to check the security groups and firewall rules of the cluster. If there are no log entries in either the apiserver logs or the metadata injection deployment, it means that the webhook was not properly registered. Ensure the metadata injection setup job ran successfully by inspecting the output of: kubectl get job newrelic-metadata-setup Copy If the job is not completed, investigate the logs of the setup job: kubectl logs job/newrelic-metadata-setup Copy Ensure the CertificateSigningRequest is approved and issued by running: kubectl get csr newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default Copy Ensure the TLS secret is present by running: kubectl get secret newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Ensure the CA bundle is present in the mutating webhook configuration: kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg -o json Copy Ensure the TargetPort of the Service resource matches the Port of the Deployment's container: kubectl describe service/newrelic-metadata-injection-svc kubectl describe deployment/newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment Copy",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "Important Auto-telemetry with Pixie is a supported public beta. Therefore, the features and functionality are subject to change. By joining the beta for Auto-telemetry with Pixie, you agree to the terms in the New Relic Pre-Release Policy. When we say auto-telemetry, we’re not talking about cars — we’re talking about automatically collecting telemetry data for your Kubernetes clusters. With our Pixie integration, you no longer have to manually instrument your clusters or change code. With one install command, you get observability into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Pixie collects telemetry data using eBPF, a virtual machine-like construct in the Linux kernel. eBPF makes it easy to collect similar data about your clusters and workloads as with traditional New Relic language agents, but now without needing to update your code. Simply put, Auto-telemetry with Pixie offers the quickest option for getting observability into your Kubernetes services. Why it matters Our Pixie integration gives you the best of both worlds: Pixie’s fast and simple Kubernetes observability coupled with New Relic One’s incident correlation, intelligent alerting, and long-term retention. You’ll get visibility into HTTP services using golden signals, HTTP transactions, database transactions, distributed tracing, and JVM metrics. You can operate, debug, and scale your Kubernetes clusters based on the information you learn about how your clusters and services are running. Using the New Relic Explorer, you can see key metrics and events at every level, starting with the cluster, and diving down into namespaces, deployments, and pods. You can quickly spot anomalous behavior, and where it’s happening. If you need further insight, you can easily link over to Pixie's native UI for advanced debugging with PXL scripts. Install Auto-telemetry with Pixie Use our guided installation process to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie. This deploys Pixie with New Relic's Kubernetes integration on your cluster. You don't need to do any further configuration or installation to start using Pixie. If you want to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie on multiple clusters, re-run the guided install for each additional cluster. Beta limitations The following are not supported in this beta version of Auto-telemetry with Pixie: OpenShift. While our New Relic infrastructure agent supports OpenShift, Pixie does not. RBAC. New Relic RBAC controls cannot be used to gate access to Pixie. This means the following: Auto-telemetry with Pixie creates one project for all of your Kubernetes clusters users from the same email domain are automatically allowed access to the project all users have full permissions on the project Before you begin The guided install requires the following (you can get these set up before you begin, or during the install steps): a Pixie account You need a Google account to sign up for Pixie. a Pixie API key Sufficient memory: Pixie requires 2Gb of memory per node. Start the guided installation Open our New Relic One guided install. Select the account you want to use for the guided install, and click Continue. Note: if you have a single account, you won't see this option. Select Kubernetes. Type in a name for your cluster, and select the check box to Gather telemetry automatically with Pixie beta. Important Currently, Pixie performs best on clusters with up to 100 nodes (exceeding 100 nodes can lead to excessive memory usage and scripts failing to run). Friendly reminder: autoscaling can quickly drive up your node numbers. If Pixie is already running on your cluster, expand the Advanced options section and select the appropriate check box. We strongly recommend enabling Pixie auto update to maintain the latest Pixie version. Click Continue. Provide your Pixie API key. If you already have a key, simply paste it in the API key box, and click Continue. If you don't have an account and existing API key, click the link to create a Pixie account. Then, on the API key page, click New key to add a new key. In the Actions column, click the ellipsis, and then click Copy value. Switch back to the guided install UI, paste the value into the API key box, and click Continue. When you click Continue, the API key is added to your New Relic account, and a deploy key is created for Pixie. Your Pixie account information is now stored on your New Relic account; if you follow the install steps again, you won't be asked for this information. On the Choose install method page, copy the Helm command that's provided, and then run it on your command line. Helm installs a bundle containing the New Relic infrastructure agent, an integration to gather Prometheus metrics and Kubernetes events, and the Pixie integration. The deployment takes a few minutes to complete. To see the status of the install to the cluster, run kubectl get pods -n newrelic. In the New Relic install UI, click Continue to open the Listening for data page. When you get the message, See your data, click Kubernetes Cluster Explorer to see your cluster. Note that Auto-telemetry with Pixie might restart after installation. This is caused by the auto update feature. Explore your cluster In the cluster explorer, you can get a quick overview of the nodes in your cluster, including CPU, memory, and storage, as well as the status of each pod (healthy, warning, or critical). You can also find out what services are running in each container, their latency, throughput, and error rate. For more information about using the cluster explorer, see Navigate the Kubernetes cluster explorer. Tip Containers might be listed for up to four hours after they get decommissioned. You can query the Pixie data that's available in New Relic One and create dashboards for at-a-glance monitoring. Find the data model and sample queries here. In addition to analyzing the performance of your clusters in New Relic One, you might want to use Pixie's advanced debugging workflows. In Pixie's native UI, you can drill down further into header and content requests. Click Explore service in Pixie to see information about your service in the Pixie UI.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Read on to learn how New Relic on-host integrations collect and report data to New Relic. Data collection and reporting process This is how an infrastructure on-host integration sends data to New Relic: On startup, the infrastructure agent scans the directory that contains the integration's definition files. The infrastructure agent registers every integration executable defined in the definition file. The agent scans a dedicated directory for integration configuration files. If those config files specify integrations that have been registered with the infrastructure agent, the agent sets up and schedules the integrations. At the scheduled interval (the default is 15 seconds), the agent harvests the data from the integration and prepares it for transmission. Every 60 seconds, it sends that data to New Relic, along with any other infrastructure data. After a successful collection pass, the integration executable exits. File structure and specifications Understanding the file structure of New Relic on-host integrations can help you customize your integration, understand and use your data, and troubleshoot problems. On-host integrations adhere to a set of open source specifications, allowing anyone to build their own infrastructure on-host integration.

To filter the alert to Kubernetes entities that only have the chosen attributes, select Filter. Select the threshold settings. For more on the Trigger an alert when... options, see Alert types. Select an existing alert policy, or create a new one. Select Create. When an alert condition's threshold is triggered, New Relic sends a notification to the policy's notification channels. Use the predefined alert types and thresholds The Kubernetes integration comes with its own alert policy and alert conditions. To see what the predefined alert conditions are, see Kubernetes integration: Predefined alert policy. In addition, you can create an alert condition for any metric collected by any New Relic integration you use, including the Kubernetes integration: Select the alert type Integrations. From the Select a data source dropdown, select a Kubernetes (K8s) data source. Select alert notifications When an alert condition's threshold is triggered, New Relic sends a message to the notification channel(s) chosen in the alert policy. Depending on the type of notification, you may have the following options: View the incident. Acknowledge the incident. Go to a chart of the incident data by selecting the identifier name. The entity identifier that triggered the alert appears near the top of the notification message. The format of the identifier depends on the alert type: Available pods are less than desired pods alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:replicaset:REPLICASET_NAME Copy CPU or memory usage alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:POD_NAME:container:CONTAINER_NAME Copy Here are some examples. Pod alert notification example For Available pods are less than desired pods alerts, the ID of the ReplicaSet triggering the issue might look like this: k8s:beam-production:default:replicaset:nginx-deployment-1623441481 Copy This identifier contains the following information: Cluster name: beam-production Parent namespace: default ReplicaSet name: nginx-deployment-1623441481 Container resource notification example For container CPU or memory usage alerts, the entity might look like this: k8s:beam-production:kube-system:kube-state-metrics-797bb87c75-zncwn:container:kube-state-metrics Copy This identifier contains the following information: Cluster name: beam-production Parent namespace: kube-system Pod namespace: kube-state-metrics-797bb87c75-zncwn Container name: kube-state-metrics Create alert conditions using NRQL Follow standard procedures to create alert conditions for NRQL queries.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Read on to learn how New Relic on-host integrations collect and report data to New Relic. Data collection and reporting process This is how an infrastructure on-host integration sends data to New Relic: On startup, the infrastructure agent scans the directory that contains the integration's definition files. The infrastructure agent registers every integration executable defined in the definition file. The agent scans a dedicated directory for integration configuration files. If those config files specify integrations that have been registered with the infrastructure agent, the agent sets up and schedules the integrations. At the scheduled interval (the default is 15 seconds), the agent harvests the data from the integration and prepares it for transmission. Every 60 seconds, it sends that data to New Relic, along with any other infrastructure data. After a successful collection pass, the integration executable exits. File structure and specifications Understanding the file structure of New Relic on-host integrations can help you customize your integration, understand and use your data, and troubleshoot problems. On-host integrations adhere to a set of open source specifications, allowing anyone to build their own infrastructure on-host integration.

      "body": "New Relic infrastructure monitoring provides an integration for Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) that reports data from your Azure VMs service to New Relic. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be captured. Features New Relic's integration for Azure Virtual Machines reports data about your VMs service, like the VM ID, the VM size, the availability set, and the region name. You can monitor and alert on your Azure VMs data from New Relic, and you can create custom queries and chart dashboards. Requirements Requirements include: New Relic infrastructure agent installed with Infrastructure agent version 1.0.775 or higher. (Update the infrastructure agent.) New Relic Azure integrations activated Activate integration To enable this integration follow standard procedures to activate your Azure service in New Relic. Important You must install the infrastructure agent on each VM to see metrics from that host. Connecting your Azure subscription allows New Relic to access VM metadata. Configuration and polling You can change the polling frequency and filter data using configuration options. Default polling information for the Virtual Machines integration: Polling interval: 5 minutes Resolution: 1 data point per minute Find and use data To find your integration data, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and look for the integration. You can query and explore your data using the AzureVirtualMachineSample event type. The provider value is AzureVirtualMachine. For more on how to find and use integration data, see Understand and use data. Inventory data Inventory data is information about your system's state and configuration. For details on how to find and use inventory data, see Understand and use data. The Azure Virtual Machines integration reports this inventory data: availabilitySet bootDiagnosticsEnabled image linuxConfiguration name networkInterfaces osDisk provisioningState regionName resourceGroupName (deprecates resourceGroup) vmId vmSize windowsConfiguration Other system data The Azure Virtual Machines integration also collects the following attributes about the service and its configuration: Region Availability zone Instance type Instance ID Troubleshooting If you use Host not reporting alert conditions, the importing of Azure metadata for your VMs will change the hosts registry and result in false alert notifications. To prevent false positives: For each Azure instance, disable its Host not reporting alert condition. Update the infrastructure agent for all instances that used this alert condition. Re-enable each Host not reporting alert condition.",
