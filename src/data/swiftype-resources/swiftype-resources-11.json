Learn how to connect this integration to infrastructure monitoring and about the metric data and inventory data that New Relic reports for this integration. Features Google Cloud Storage is a Google Cloud Platform service that you can use to serve website content, to store data for archival and disaster recovery, and to distribute data objects via direct download. With the Google Cloud Storage integration, you can access these features: View charts and information about the data you are storing and retrieving from Google Cloud Storage. Create custom queries and charts in from automatically captured data. Set alerts on your Google Cloud Storage data directly from the Integrations page. Activate integration To enable the integration follow standard procedures to connect your GCP service to New Relic. Polling frequency New Relic queries your Google Cloud Storage services based on a polling interval of 5 minutes. Find and use data After connecting the integration to New Relic and waiting a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use integration data, including your dashboards and your alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP > Google Cloud Storage. To create custom dashboards for the integration, create queries for the GcpStorageBucketSample event type with the provider value GcpStorageBucket. Metric data The integration reports metric data for all values of method and response_code: response_code: The response code of the requests. method: The name of the API method called. The metric data that New Relic receives from your Google Cloud Storage integration includes: Metric Description api.Requests Delta count of API calls. network.ReceivedBytes Delta count of bytes received over the network. network.SentBytes Delta count of bytes sent over the network. Inventory data Inventory data for Google Cloud Storage bucket objects includes the following properties: Inventory data Description acl Access control list for the bucket that lets you specify who has access to your data and to what extent. cors The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration for the bucket. createTime Time when the bucket was created. defaultAcl Default access control list configuration for the bucket's blobs. etag HTTP 1.1 entity tag for the bucket. indexPage The bucket's website index page. This behaves as the bucket's directory index where missing blobs are treated as potential directories. labels Labels for the bucket, in key/value pairs. This is only available if the GCP project is linked to New Relic through a service account and extended inventory collection is enabled. metageneration The generation of the metadata for the bucket. name The name of the bucket. notFoundPage The custom object that will be returned when a requested resource is not found. owner The owner of the bucket. A bucket is always owned by the project team owners group. project The name that you assigned to the project. A project consists of a set of users, a set of APIs, and settings for those APIs. requesterPays If set to true, the user accessing the bucket or an object it contains assumes the access transit costs. storageClass The default storage class for a bucket, if you don't specify one for a new object. The storage class defines how Google Cloud Storage stores objects in the bucket and determines the SLA and storage cost. For more information, see storage classes. zone The zone where the bucket is deployed.",

Important You must install the Infrastructure agent on each GCE host to see metrics from that host. Connecting your Google Cloud projects allows Infrastructure to access GCE metadata, such as region, type, and tags. Polling frequency New Relic Infrastructure integrations query your GCP services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. The polling interval for the Google Compute Engine integration is 5 minutes. Find and use data After activating the integration and waiting a few minutes (based on the polling frequency), data will appear in the New Relic UI.

Learn how to connect this integration to infrastructure monitoring and about the metric data and inventory data that New Relic reports for this integration. Features Google Cloud Storage is a Google Cloud Platform service that you can use to serve website content, to store data for archival and disaster recovery, and to distribute data objects via direct download. With the Google Cloud Storage integration, you can access these features: View charts and information about the data you are storing and retrieving from Google Cloud Storage. Create custom queries and charts in from automatically captured data. Set alerts on your Google Cloud Storage data directly from the Integrations page. Activate integration To enable the integration follow standard procedures to connect your GCP service to New Relic. Polling frequency New Relic queries your Google Cloud Storage services based on a polling interval of 5 minutes. Find and use data After connecting the integration to New Relic and waiting a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use integration data, including your dashboards and your alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP > Google Cloud Storage. To create custom dashboards for the integration, create queries for the GcpStorageBucketSample event type with the provider value GcpStorageBucket. Metric data The integration reports metric data for all values of method and response_code: response_code: The response code of the requests. method: The name of the API method called. The metric data that New Relic receives from your Google Cloud Storage integration includes: Metric Description api.Requests Delta count of API calls. network.ReceivedBytes Delta count of bytes received over the network. network.SentBytes Delta count of bytes sent over the network. Inventory data Inventory data for Google Cloud Storage bucket objects includes the following properties: Inventory data Description acl Access control list for the bucket that lets you specify who has access to your data and to what extent. cors The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration for the bucket. createTime Time when the bucket was created. defaultAcl Default access control list configuration for the bucket's blobs. etag HTTP 1.1 entity tag for the bucket. indexPage The bucket's website index page. This behaves as the bucket's directory index where missing blobs are treated as potential directories. labels Labels for the bucket, in key/value pairs. This is only available if the GCP project is linked to New Relic through a service account and extended inventory collection is enabled. metageneration The generation of the metadata for the bucket. name The name of the bucket. notFoundPage The custom object that will be returned when a requested resource is not found. owner The owner of the bucket. A bucket is always owned by the project team owners group. project The name that you assigned to the project. A project consists of a set of users, a set of APIs, and settings for those APIs. requesterPays If set to true, the user accessing the bucket or an object it contains assumes the access transit costs. storageClass The default storage class for a bucket, if you don't specify one for a new object. The storage class defines how Google Cloud Storage stores objects in the bucket and determines the SLA and storage cost. For more information, see storage classes. zone The zone where the bucket is deployed.",

Learn how to connect this integration to infrastructure monitoring and about the metric data and inventory data that New Relic reports for this integration. Features Google Cloud Storage is a Google Cloud Platform service that you can use to serve website content, to store data for archival and disaster recovery, and to distribute data objects via direct download. With the Google Cloud Storage integration, you can access these features: View charts and information about the data you are storing and retrieving from Google Cloud Storage. Create custom queries and charts in from automatically captured data. Set alerts on your Google Cloud Storage data directly from the Integrations page. Activate integration To enable the integration follow standard procedures to connect your GCP service to New Relic. Polling frequency New Relic queries your Google Cloud Storage services based on a polling interval of 5 minutes. Find and use data After connecting the integration to New Relic and waiting a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use integration data, including your dashboards and your alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP > Google Cloud Storage. To create custom dashboards for the integration, create queries for the GcpStorageBucketSample event type with the provider value GcpStorageBucket. Metric data The integration reports metric data for all values of method and response_code: response_code: The response code of the requests. method: The name of the API method called. The metric data that New Relic receives from your Google Cloud Storage integration includes: Metric Description api.Requests Delta count of API calls. network.ReceivedBytes Delta count of bytes received over the network. network.SentBytes Delta count of bytes sent over the network. Inventory data Inventory data for Google Cloud Storage bucket objects includes the following properties: Inventory data Description acl Access control list for the bucket that lets you specify who has access to your data and to what extent. cors The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration for the bucket. createTime Time when the bucket was created. defaultAcl Default access control list configuration for the bucket's blobs. etag HTTP 1.1 entity tag for the bucket. indexPage The bucket's website index page. This behaves as the bucket's directory index where missing blobs are treated as potential directories. labels Labels for the bucket, in key/value pairs. This is only available if the GCP project is linked to New Relic through a service account and extended inventory collection is enabled. metageneration The generation of the metadata for the bucket. name The name of the bucket. notFoundPage The custom object that will be returned when a requested resource is not found. owner The owner of the bucket. A bucket is always owned by the project team owners group. project The name that you assigned to the project. A project consists of a set of users, a set of APIs, and settings for those APIs. requesterPays If set to true, the user accessing the bucket or an object it contains assumes the access transit costs. storageClass The default storage class for a bucket, if you don't specify one for a new object. The storage class defines how Google Cloud Storage stores objects in the bucket and determines the SLA and storage cost. For more information, see storage classes. zone The zone where the bucket is deployed.",

To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account. List of permissions Common permissions All integrations need the following permission: monitoring.timeSeries.list serviceusage.services.use Service-specific permissions For some GCP integrations, New Relic will also need the following permissions, mainly to collect labels and inventory attributes. Integration Permissions Google AppEngine n/a; Google App Engine does not require additional permissions.

After the projects are linked, assign a Google Cloud custom role to the authorized account. Use New Relic NerdGraph to link Google Cloud projects to New Relic. This does not involve listing the viewable projects. However, you must know the id of the project you want to monitor.

      "body": "To read the relevant data from your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account, New Relic uses the Google Stackdriver API and also other specific services APIs. To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account. List of permissions Common permissions All integrations need the following permission: monitoring.timeSeries.list serviceusage.services.use Service-specific permissions For some GCP integrations, New Relic will also need the following permissions, mainly to collect labels and inventory attributes. Integration Permissions Google AppEngine n/a; Google App Engine does not require additional permissions. Google BigQuery bigquery.datasets.get bigquery.tables.get bigquery.tables.list Google Cloud Functions cloudfunctions.locations.list Google Cloud Load Balancing n/a; Google Cloud Load Balancing does not require additional permissions.

After the projects are linked, assign a Google Cloud custom role to the authorized account. Use New Relic NerdGraph to link Google Cloud projects to New Relic. This does not involve listing the viewable projects. However, you must know the id of the project you want to monitor. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL cloud integrations API tutorial.",

Tip To use Google Cloud Platform integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements These are the requirements for the authorization: GCP integration requirements Comments Monitoring In the GCP project API & Services Library settings, you must enable Google Stackdriver Monitoring API. Authorization For service account authorization (recommended): A user with Project IAM Admin role is needed to add the service account ID as a member in your GCP project. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the service account must have the Project Viewer role and the Service Usage Consumer role or, alternatively, a custom role. For user account authorization: The New Relic user that will integrate the GCP project must have a Google account and must be able to view the GCP project that New Relic will monitor. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the user must have the Project Viewer role. Please note that this authorization method will not allow New Relic to collect labels and other inventory attributes that can be useful for narrowing down your NRQL queries, dashboards and alerts. You can migrate the authorization method from user account to service account from the Manage services link in New Relic's user interface. Project name As part of the online setup process, you must identify Project name of the projects you want to monitor with New Relic. The UI workflow automatically lists active projects you can select. Permissions (only for user account authorization) New Relic requires a specific set of read-only permissions exclusively; this means that, for certain integrations, only partial inventory data will be available. Keep in mind that New Relic doesn't inherit your Google account's permissions and therefore is not authorized to perform any changes in the project. For more information about the API permissions that New Relic uses, see the Google documentation about scopes. Authorization options Integrating your GCP project with New Relic requires you to authorize New Relic to fetch monitoring data from your GCP project. You can choose between two authorization methods: Service accounts or User accounts. Service account (recommended) The service account authorization is recommended. If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a service account, we will call your GCP project APIs using a service account ID and its associated public/private key pair. New Relic manages a specific Google service account for your New Relic account; you do not need to create it or manage the associated private key. Just add the service account ID as a member with viewing permissions in your project. This authorization method is recommended, especially if your GCP project is managed by a team. It also guarantees that New Relic will collect labels and inventory attributes whenever possible. User account If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a user account, New Relic will access your GCP project monitoring data on behalf of a particular Google user. The authorization process is achieved through an OAuth workflow, which redirects you from the New Relic UI to a Google authorization interface. However, since the authorization is linked to a particular Google user, this method is not recommended for GCP projects that are managed by large teams. Connect GCP to New Relic infrastructure monitoring To connect your Google account to New Relic with user account authorization: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. At the top of Infrastructure's Google Cloud Services integrations page, select Add a GCP account. Choose Authorization Method: Select either Authorize a Service Account or Authorize a User Account, and follow the instructions in the UI to authorize New Relic. Add projects: Select the projects that you want New Relic to receive data from. Select services: From the list of available services for your GCP account, select the individual services you want New Relic to receive data from, or select all of the services. Tip These services will be enabled for all of the projects that you selected in the previous step. Once the setup process is finished, you can fine-tune the services that you want monitored for each project individually. To complete the setup process, select Finish. If you see API authentication errors, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Explore app data in New Relic After you authorize New Relic to integrate one or more of your Google project's services, New Relic starts monitoring your GCP data at regular polling intervals. After a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. Link multiple Google projects For your convenience, the setup process allows you to select more than one project at a time. After the first setup, if you need to monitor additional GCP projects with New Relic, you can repeat the procedure to connect your GCP services as many times as you need. Unlink your GCP integrations You can disable any of your GCP integrations any time and still keep your Google project connected to New Relic. If you want to... Do this Disable a GCP service monitoring To disconnect individual GCP services but keep the integration with New Relic for other GCP services in your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, make changes to the checkbox options for available services and select Save changes. Unlink your project monitoring To uninstall all of your GCP services completely from New Relic Integrations, unlink your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, select Unlink account and select Save changes. Clean your GCP Projects after unlinking New Relic To clean your GCP project after unlinking, follow these steps if you were using a service account: Open the GCP IAM Console. Select the project you want to unlink from New Relic and click Open. Select the service account that is used by New Relic. Click the Remove icon. Or follow these steps if you were using a user account: Open your Google user account settings. Open the Apps with access to your account section. Choose New Relic application. Choose Remove Access.",

To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account. List of permissions Common permissions All integrations need the following permission: monitoring.timeSeries.list serviceusage.services.use Service-specific permissions For some GCP integrations, New Relic will also need the following permissions, mainly to collect labels and inventory attributes.

After the projects are linked, assign a Google Cloud custom role to the authorized account. Use New Relic NerdGraph to link Google Cloud projects to New Relic. This does not involve listing the viewable projects. However, you must know the id of the project you want to monitor.

      "body": "To start receiving Google Cloud Platform (GCP) data with New Relic GCP integrations, connect your Google project to New Relic infrastructure monitoring. Tip To use Google Cloud Platform integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements These are the requirements for the authorization: GCP integration requirements Comments Monitoring In the GCP project API & Services Library settings, you must enable Google Stackdriver Monitoring API. Authorization For service account authorization (recommended): A user with Project IAM Admin role is needed to add the service account ID as a member in your GCP project. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the service account must have the Project Viewer role and the Service Usage Consumer role or, alternatively, a custom role. For user account authorization: The New Relic user that will integrate the GCP project must have a Google account and must be able to view the GCP project that New Relic will monitor. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the user must have the Project Viewer role. Please note that this authorization method will not allow New Relic to collect labels and other inventory attributes that can be useful for narrowing down your NRQL queries, dashboards and alerts. You can migrate the authorization method from user account to service account from the Manage services link in New Relic's user interface. Project name As part of the online setup process, you must identify Project name of the projects you want to monitor with New Relic. The UI workflow automatically lists active projects you can select. Permissions (only for user account authorization) New Relic requires a specific set of read-only permissions exclusively; this means that, for certain integrations, only partial inventory data will be available. Keep in mind that New Relic doesn't inherit your Google account's permissions and therefore is not authorized to perform any changes in the project. For more information about the API permissions that New Relic uses, see the Google documentation about scopes. Authorization options Integrating your GCP project with New Relic requires you to authorize New Relic to fetch monitoring data from your GCP project. You can choose between two authorization methods: Service accounts or User accounts. Service account (recommended) The service account authorization is recommended. If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a service account, we will call your GCP project APIs using a service account ID and its associated public/private key pair. New Relic manages a specific Google service account for your New Relic account; you do not need to create it or manage the associated private key. Just add the service account ID as a member with viewing permissions in your project. This authorization method is recommended, especially if your GCP project is managed by a team. It also guarantees that New Relic will collect labels and inventory attributes whenever possible. User account If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a user account, New Relic will access your GCP project monitoring data on behalf of a particular Google user. The authorization process is achieved through an OAuth workflow, which redirects you from the New Relic UI to a Google authorization interface. However, since the authorization is linked to a particular Google user, this method is not recommended for GCP projects that are managed by large teams. Connect GCP to New Relic infrastructure monitoring To connect your Google account to New Relic with user account authorization: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. At the top of Infrastructure's Google Cloud Services integrations page, select Add a GCP account. Choose Authorization Method: Select either Authorize a Service Account or Authorize a User Account, and follow the instructions in the UI to authorize New Relic. Add projects: Select the projects that you want New Relic to receive data from. Select services: From the list of available services for your GCP account, select the individual services you want New Relic to receive data from, or select all of the services. Tip These services will be enabled for all of the projects that you selected in the previous step. Once the setup process is finished, you can fine-tune the services that you want monitored for each project individually. To complete the setup process, select Finish. If you see API authentication errors, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Explore app data in New Relic After you authorize New Relic to integrate one or more of your Google project's services, New Relic starts monitoring your GCP data at regular polling intervals. After a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. Link multiple Google projects For your convenience, the setup process allows you to select more than one project at a time. After the first setup, if you need to monitor additional GCP projects with New Relic, you can repeat the procedure to connect your GCP services as many times as you need. Unlink your GCP integrations You can disable any of your GCP integrations any time and still keep your Google project connected to New Relic. If you want to... Do this Disable a GCP service monitoring To disconnect individual GCP services but keep the integration with New Relic for other GCP services in your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, make changes to the checkbox options for available services and select Save changes. Unlink your project monitoring To uninstall all of your GCP services completely from New Relic Integrations, unlink your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, select Unlink account and select Save changes. Clean your GCP Projects after unlinking New Relic To clean your GCP project after unlinking, follow these steps if you were using a service account: Open the GCP IAM Console. Select the project you want to unlink from New Relic and click Open. Select the service account that is used by New Relic. Click the Remove icon. Or follow these steps if you were using a user account: Open your Google user account settings. Open the Apps with access to your account section. Choose New Relic application. Choose Remove Access.",

Tip To use Google Cloud Platform integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements These are the requirements for the authorization: GCP integration requirements Comments Monitoring In the GCP project API & Services Library settings, you must enable Google Stackdriver Monitoring API. Authorization For service account authorization (recommended): A user with Project IAM Admin role is needed to add the service account ID as a member in your GCP project. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the service account must have the Project Viewer role and the Service Usage Consumer role or, alternatively, a custom role. For user account authorization: The New Relic user that will integrate the GCP project must have a Google account and must be able to view the GCP project that New Relic will monitor. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the user must have the Project Viewer role. Please note that this authorization method will not allow New Relic to collect labels and other inventory attributes that can be useful for narrowing down your NRQL queries, dashboards and alerts. You can migrate the authorization method from user account to service account from the Manage services link in New Relic's user interface. Project name As part of the online setup process, you must identify Project name of the projects you want to monitor with New Relic. The UI workflow automatically lists active projects you can select. Permissions (only for user account authorization) New Relic requires a specific set of read-only permissions exclusively; this means that, for certain integrations, only partial inventory data will be available. Keep in mind that New Relic doesn't inherit your Google account's permissions and therefore is not authorized to perform any changes in the project. For more information about the API permissions that New Relic uses, see the Google documentation about scopes. Authorization options Integrating your GCP project with New Relic requires you to authorize New Relic to fetch monitoring data from your GCP project. You can choose between two authorization methods: Service accounts or User accounts. Service account (recommended) The service account authorization is recommended. If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a service account, we will call your GCP project APIs using a service account ID and its associated public/private key pair. New Relic manages a specific Google service account for your New Relic account; you do not need to create it or manage the associated private key. Just add the service account ID as a member with viewing permissions in your project. This authorization method is recommended, especially if your GCP project is managed by a team. It also guarantees that New Relic will collect labels and inventory attributes whenever possible. User account If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a user account, New Relic will access your GCP project monitoring data on behalf of a particular Google user. The authorization process is achieved through an OAuth workflow, which redirects you from the New Relic UI to a Google authorization interface. However, since the authorization is linked to a particular Google user, this method is not recommended for GCP projects that are managed by large teams. Connect GCP to New Relic infrastructure monitoring To connect your Google account to New Relic with user account authorization: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. At the top of Infrastructure's Google Cloud Services integrations page, select Add a GCP account. Choose Authorization Method: Select either Authorize a Service Account or Authorize a User Account, and follow the instructions in the UI to authorize New Relic. Add projects: Select the projects that you want New Relic to receive data from. Select services: From the list of available services for your GCP account, select the individual services you want New Relic to receive data from, or select all of the services. Tip These services will be enabled for all of the projects that you selected in the previous step. Once the setup process is finished, you can fine-tune the services that you want monitored for each project individually. To complete the setup process, select Finish. If you see API authentication errors, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Explore app data in New Relic After you authorize New Relic to integrate one or more of your Google project's services, New Relic starts monitoring your GCP data at regular polling intervals. After a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. Link multiple Google projects For your convenience, the setup process allows you to select more than one project at a time. After the first setup, if you need to monitor additional GCP projects with New Relic, you can repeat the procedure to connect your GCP services as many times as you need. Unlink your GCP integrations You can disable any of your GCP integrations any time and still keep your Google project connected to New Relic. If you want to... Do this Disable a GCP service monitoring To disconnect individual GCP services but keep the integration with New Relic for other GCP services in your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, make changes to the checkbox options for available services and select Save changes. Unlink your project monitoring To uninstall all of your GCP services completely from New Relic Integrations, unlink your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, select Unlink account and select Save changes. Clean your GCP Projects after unlinking New Relic To clean your GCP project after unlinking, follow these steps if you were using a service account: Open the GCP IAM Console. Select the project you want to unlink from New Relic and click Open. Select the service account that is used by New Relic. Click the Remove icon. Or follow these steps if you were using a user account: Open your Google user account settings. Open the Apps with access to your account section. Choose New Relic application. Choose Remove Access.",

At the top of Infrastructure's Google Cloud Services integrations page, select Add a GCP account. Choose Authorization Method: Select either Authorize a Service Account or Authorize a User Account, and follow the instructions in the UI to authorize New Relic. Add projects: Select the projects that you want New Relic to receive data from. Select services: From the list of available services for your GCP account, select the individual services you want New Relic to receive data from, or select all of the services. Tip These services will be enabled for all of the projects that you selected in the previous step. Once the setup process is finished, you can fine-tune the services that you want monitored for each project individually. To complete the setup process, select Finish. If you see API authentication errors, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Explore app data in New Relic After you authorize New Relic to integrate one or more of your Google project's services, New Relic starts monitoring your GCP data at regular polling intervals. After a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. Link multiple Google projects For your convenience, the setup process allows you to select more than one project at a time. After the first setup, if you need to monitor additional GCP projects with New Relic, you can repeat the procedure to connect your GCP services as many times as you need. Unlink your GCP integrations You can disable any of your GCP integrations any time and still keep your Google project connected to New Relic. If you want to... Do this Disable a GCP service monitoring To disconnect individual GCP services but keep the integration with New Relic for other GCP services in your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, make changes to the checkbox options for available services and select Save changes. Unlink your project monitoring To uninstall all of your GCP services completely from New Relic Integrations, unlink your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, select Unlink account and select Save changes. Clean your GCP Projects after unlinking New Relic To clean your GCP project after unlinking, follow these steps if you were using a service account: Open the GCP IAM Console. Select the project you want to unlink from New Relic and click Open. Select the service account that is used by New Relic. Click the Remove icon.

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more new relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API.

The following tips and sample queries were created for New Relic-built integrations, but most will also apply to integrations built with the Integrations SDK. For a general look at how to find and use integration data, see New Relic data types. Get started with integration data Here are some tips for finding and exploring your integration data in New Relic: From the one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services page, select an integration dashboard. There, you can view the NRQL queries that generated a chart. For examples of NRQL queries for integration data, see the example queries. Use the data explorer or the dashboards to explore and understand the available data. Read the documentation for a specific integration to learn about the reported data. When you create a useful query you'd like to add to your Insights dashboard, select Add to dashboard. Example NRQL queries Here are some examples of NRQL queries that use integration data: AWS EBS query example Here's a NRQL query for the AWS EBS service, showing the total write time metric, faceted by entityName: SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') FROM BlockDeviceSample WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Azure Service Bus query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for the maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic queue, faceted by resource group: SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample FACET resourceGroupName Copy Azure Functions query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for Azure Functions, showing the count of executed functions over the past six hours by region over time: SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for Azure VMs that compares the count of VM events over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago: SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample FACET name SINCE 30 minutes ago COMPARE WITH 1 week ago Copy NGINX query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your NGINX integration data and place in an Insights dashboard. This query creates a chart showing the average value of NGINX requests per second over time: SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) FROM NginxSample TIMESERIES Copy For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. MySQL query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your MySQL integration data. This query generates a chart showing the maximum number of used MySQL connections: SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) FROM MysqlSample Copy For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. Inventory change query example Here's an example of a query that groups inventory change events from the last day by the type of change: SELECT count(*) FROM InfrastructureEvent WHERE format='inventoryChange' FACET changeType SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy Tip You can also perform these queries using dimensional metrics. Tips for using different data types Integrations can generate metric, event, and inventory data, all of which are available for querying in New Relic Insights. Here are some tips for using the different types of integration data in Insights: Metric data tips Tips for finding and using integration metric data in Insights: All integration data is attached to a data type known as an event (not to be confused with events reported by integrations, which represent important activity in your host/service). This means that all integration data can be found via the data explorer. For more about these two basic New Relic data types, see New Relic data collection. Metric values are treated as attributes: key-value pairs attached to an event. For example, the MySQL integration has an 'active connections' metric; this would be found by querying the connectionsActive attribute of the MysqlSample event. For general information about metrics, see Integration metric data. Event data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration event data in Insights: Most integration events are inventory change events. When inventory is changed, it generates an InfrastructureEvent with a format value of inventoryChange. Integration data can be found via the data explorer. For general information about events, see Event data. Inventory data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration inventory data in Insights: For general information about inventory data, see Integration inventory data. Some inventory data is added as attributes (key-value pairs) to Insights data. For example, the AWS EC2 integration collects awsRegion as inventory data; this would be found in Insights by querying the awsRegion attribute of the ComputeSample event type and provider Ec2Instance. When inventory data changes, an Insights InfrastructureEvent event type is generated with a format value of inventoryChange. See the query examples for an example of querying this data.

      "body": "New Relic infrastructure integrations allow you to report data from specific systems and supplement infrastructure's default, automatic monitoring. The Microsoft Azure integrations report data from various Azure platform services to your New Relic account. This document explains how to activate Azure integrations. Tip To use Azure integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements The Azure integration activation process requires you to: Create a New Relic application and key in Azure. Grant this application access to the Azure services you want to monitor. Place required information in the New Relic's Integrations UI. To use these integration activation instructions directly from the Infrastructure UI, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > Add an Azure account. Step 1: Get Azure subscription and tenant IDs To get your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId, use your local terminal if you have Azure's tools installed, or use Azure's Cloud Shell terminal in the Azure portal. Open a terminal with access to your Azure account. Type the following: az account show Copy Copy and save the subscription id and tenantID from the output response for later use. The response should look similar to the response below. The subscription id and tenantID are highlighted. @Azure:~$ az account show { \"environmentName\": \"AzureCloud\", \"id\": \"9ffe9512-f4a2-42dd-1230-518aec34be21\" , \"isDefault\": true, \"name\": \"Beyond Team Sandbox\", \"state\": \"Enabled\", \"tenantId\": \"ac6692da-1231-422f-22a8-9eed6dbe83f1\" , \"user\": { \"name\": \"youremail@domain\", \"type\": \"user\" } Copy Step 2: Register your app and get ID You must have Azure permissions to register your application and copy its Application ID. To register your app in Azure: Sign in to the Azure portal and go to the Azure Active Directory. From Manage, select App registrations > New registration. Enter a name for the application. We recommend that you name your app NewRelic-Integrations. In Redirect URI select Weband add https://www.newrelic.com as the sign-on URI. Create the application by clicking Register. From the Overview of your app, copy the Application (client) ID, and save it for later use. Step 3: Create a client secret in Azure To create a client secret associated with your application: In Azure, under the application you've just created, select Certificates & secrets. Under Client secrets, click on New client secret and then on Add. Copy the value of Client Secret and save it for later use. Step 4: Provide permissions to services Your app must provide Reader permissions for each Azure service you want New Relic to monitor: In the Azure Subscriptions section, select the subscriptions that you want New Relic to monitor. Select Access control (IAM) > Add > Add role assignment. From the Role dropdown, select Reader. From the Select dropdown, select the app's name; for example, NewRelic-Integrations. From Selected members, verify your app name appears, then select Save. Some Azure services, including Azure CosmosDB and Azure VMs, require additional steps. See the Azure integration documentation for the services you want to enable. Step 5: Add app to New Relic Now you can activate the Azure integration in the Infrastructure UI. The UI will require the information you have saved in the previous steps, including: Your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId The application's application ID The application's client secret To add your Azure app to New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and select the Azure Service you wish to add. Follow the steps in the UI to activate the integration in New Relic. If you have already completed the Azure account steps, skip to the end of the steps to fill out the form. (For Azure account name, enter the name you want to use to identify the account in your Integrations dashboard.) Update application details and rotate client secrets It's possible to update the application's name and authentication credentials using the Infrastructure UI or the Cloud Integrations API at any time. Follow these steps to rotate the Azure client secret in the Infratructure UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and click on Manage Services on the Azure account you wish to edit. Select the edit action next to Account Name to see and edit any application value. Edit the Client Secret field with the new value and confirm with Save Changes. Explore app data in New Relic Infrastructure's UI After you activate an Azure integration, New Relic will start monitoring your Azure data at regular polling intervals. To find and use your data, use the data explorer or go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure",

      "body": "In Grafana, you can configure New Relic as a Prometheus data source. Not only that, within Grafana you can query metrics stored in New Relic using the PromQL query language. Use existing Grafana dashboards with New Relic When you integrate Prometheus metrics with New Relic via Remote Write or the OpenMetrics Integration (2.0+) and configure New Relic as a Prometheus data source in Grafana, you can use existing Grafana dashboards and seamlessly tap into the additional monitoring, reliability, and scale we provide. Compatibility and requirements Before you begin, make sure you’ve finished integrating Prometheus metrics and are running a recent enough version of Grafana. You should have either the Remote Write or the OpenMetrics Integration ( v2.0+) set up before you can configure New Relic Prometheus data sources in Grafana. You can only configure New Relic Prometheus data sources using this method in Grafana versions 6.7.0 or newer. You will need to configure custom headers in the UI, and this isn’t possible with earlier versions. For details, see Configure New Relic as a Prometheus data source for Grafana. Support for PromQL Our Prometheus API emulates Prometheus' query APIs. We support the Prometheus query language (PromQL) through our PromQL-style query mode. We do our best to automatically translate PromQL syntax queries into the closest NRQL approximation. For more information on how this works and differences you may observe between Prometheus and New Relic, see Supported PromQL features. Get data flowing in Grafana To make your New Relic data available in Grafana, you can configure a new or existing Prometheus data source in just a couple of simple steps: In the Grafana UI, add and configure a new data source. Save the new data source and start viewing your data. What’s next? Ready to configure a Grafana data source?

We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used.

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more new relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API.

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

This is the number reported by tools such as top(1) and ps(1). Keyspace metrics The Redis integration collects the following keyspace metadata and metrics. These attributes are attached to the RedisKeyspaceSample event type: Name Description db.avgTtl The average time to live (TTL) in milliseconds of keys that have an expiration set in the database being reported on. db.keys Number of keys in the database being reported on. db.keyspace Redis database index, which is the integer number (usually a number between 0 and 15). Format: db followed by the database index. For example: db0, db1, db2, etc. db.expires Number of keys with an expiration in the database being reported on. Inventory data Inventory data includes everything reported by the Redis CONFIG GET command, with the exception of requirepass, which stores the password to the Redis server. For more on inventory data, see Understand inventory data. Other system data The Redis integration collects these additional attributes about your Redis service: Name Description software.version The version of the Redis server. Example: 3.2.3. cluster.role Either master or slave, depending on the role of the Redis node being monitored. Check the source code This integration is open source software.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration file integration_name: com.newrelic.postgresql instances: # A name for the collection - name: sample_postgres # The only supported command is all_data. command: all_data arguments: # The username for the Postgres instance. Required. username: postgres # The password for the Postgres instance. Required. password: pass # The hostname for the Postgres instance. Defaults to localhost. hostname: psql-sample.localnet # The port of the Postgres instance. If PgBouncer is being used, # use the port it is running on.

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

This is the number reported by tools such as top(1) and ps(1). Keyspace metrics The Redis integration collects the following keyspace metadata and metrics. These attributes are attached to the RedisKeyspaceSample event type: Name Description db.avgTtl The average time to live (TTL) in milliseconds of keys that have an expiration set in the database being reported on. db.keys Number of keys in the database being reported on. db.keyspace Redis database index, which is the integer number (usually a number between 0 and 15). Format: db followed by the database index. For example: db0, db1, db2, etc. db.expires Number of keys with an expiration in the database being reported on. Inventory data Inventory data includes everything reported by the Redis CONFIG GET command, with the exception of requirepass, which stores the password to the Redis server. For more on inventory data, see Understand inventory data. Other system data The Redis integration collects these additional attributes about your Redis service: Name Description software.version The version of the Redis server. Example: 3.2.3. cluster.role Either master or slave, depending on the role of the Redis node being monitored. Check the source code This integration is open source software.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration file integration_name: com.newrelic.postgresql instances: # A name for the collection - name: sample_postgres # The only supported command is all_data. command: all_data arguments: # The username for the Postgres instance. Required. username: postgres # The password for the Postgres instance. Required. password: pass # The hostname for the Postgres instance. Defaults to localhost. hostname: psql-sample.localnet # The port of the Postgres instance. If PgBouncer is being used, # use the port it is running on.

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to these event types: PostgresqlDatabaseSample PostgresqlIndexSample PostgresqlInstanceSample PostgresqlTableSample PgBouncerSample You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The PostgreSQL integration collects the following database metric attributes.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click the Guided install button. If your account reports data through our EU datacenter, click EU Guided install. Guided install EU Guided install Our infrastructure agent discovers the applications and infrastructure and log sources running in your environment, and recommends which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Supported APM agents If you have a .NET Windows application on IIS, the guided install configures and enables an APM agent. Guided install for .NET EU Guided install for .NET Why it matters With our guided install, you can instrument your applications and infrastructure and start seeing your data in New Relic in minutes. The guided install uses our command line interface (CLI), the infrastructure agent for your host environment, and a library of installation recipes to instrument your applications and infrastructure for you. That means less toil for you. Because our instrumentation recipes are open source, you can modify existing recipes, or build new ones, to suit your needs. Some technical detail The New Relic guided install uses open source installation recipes to instrument on-host integrations. These recipes include installation and setup commands, information about logs, and metadata related to what’s being installed. They're collected in a YAML file for each type of system and have all of the installation details necessary to install the infrastructure agent for a specific integration. Important On Windows, our guided install only supports Microsoft SQL Server, logs, and the infrastructure agent. All other integrations are only supported on Linux. On-host integration (OHI) recipes The guided install automates the discovery, configuration, and installation of OHIs. However, there may be times when you want to instrument them one-by-one using the CLI install command. To install any individual on-host integration, run this command: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=API_KEY NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=ACCOUNT_ID /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n INTEGRATION-FLAG Copy For example: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=<API_KEY> NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID> /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n apache-open-source-integration Copy The table lists the integrations supported by the guided install CLI command. The specific on-host integration commands are provided for your reference. Our open source integrations send performance metrics and inventory data from your servers and applications to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts.

MySQL: Incorrect user permissions To monitor MySQL health data, you need a valid username and password with specific permissions. These commands will create a user and grant the required permissions: Create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD';\" Copy Give replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Give select privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Once done, your next guided install attempt should work. NGINX: No status URL To monitor your NGINX server, you'll need to configure a valid status URL. status_url: The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. If the default value of 127.0.0.1 is incorrect, substitute the address/FQDN/URL for your system. Example: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status You can read more about the status_url in these NGINX docs: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module There are different ways to set status_url, depending on how NGINX was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: See Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: See Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: Edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Microsoft SQL Server integration links.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

This is the number reported by tools such as top(1) and ps(1). Keyspace metrics The Redis integration collects the following keyspace metadata and metrics. These attributes are attached to the RedisKeyspaceSample event type: Name Description db.avgTtl The average time to live (TTL) in milliseconds of keys that have an expiration set in the database being reported on. db.keys Number of keys in the database being reported on. db.keyspace Redis database index, which is the integer number (usually a number between 0 and 15). Format: db followed by the database index. For example: db0, db1, db2, etc. db.expires Number of keys with an expiration in the database being reported on. Inventory data Inventory data includes everything reported by the Redis CONFIG GET command, with the exception of requirepass, which stores the password to the Redis server. For more on inventory data, see Understand inventory data.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file.

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

This is the number reported by tools such as top(1) and ps(1). Keyspace metrics The Redis integration collects the following keyspace metadata and metrics. These attributes are attached to the RedisKeyspaceSample event type: Name Description db.avgTtl The average time to live (TTL) in milliseconds of keys that have an expiration set in the database being reported on. db.keys Number of keys in the database being reported on. db.keyspace Redis database index, which is the integer number (usually a number between 0 and 15). Format: db followed by the database index. For example: db0, db1, db2, etc. db.expires Number of keys with an expiration in the database being reported on. Inventory data Inventory data includes everything reported by the Redis CONFIG GET command, with the exception of requirepass, which stores the password to the Redis server. For more on inventory data, see Understand inventory data.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "If you have services that run on Docker containers in Amazon ECS (like Cassandra, Redis, MySQL, and other supported services), you can use New Relic to report data from those services, from the host, and from the containers. Requirements To monitor services running on ECS, you must meet these requirements: An auto-scaling ECS cluster running Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL that meets the infrastructure agent compatibility and requirements. ECS tasks must have network mode set to none or bridge (awsvpc and host not supported). A supported service running on ECS that meets our integration requirements: Apache (does not report inventory data) Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ (does not report inventory data) Redis SNMP How to enable Before explaining how to enable monitoring of services running in ECS, here's an overview of the process: Enable Amazon EC2 to install our infrastructure agent on your ECS clusters. Enable monitoring of services using a service-specific configuration file. Step 1: Enable EC2 to install the infrastructure agent First, you must enable Amazon EC2 to install our infrastructure agent on ECS clusters. To do this, you'll first need to update your user data to install the infrastructure agent on launch. Here are instructions for changing EC2 launch configuration (taken from Amazon EC2 documentation): Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Launch configurations. On the next page, select the launch configuration you want to update. Right click and select Copy launch configuration. On the Launch configuration details tab, click Edit details. Replace user data with one of the following snippets: For CentOS 6, RHEL 6, Amazon Linux 1 Replace the highlighted fields with relevant values: Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=\"MIMEBOUNDARY\" MIME-Version: 1.0 --MIMEBOUNDARY Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"init.cfg\" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Type: text/cloud-config Mime-Version: 1.0 yum_repos: newrelic-infra: baseurl: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/linux/yum/el/6/x86_64 gpgkey: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/gpg/newrelic-infra.gpg gpgcheck: 1 repo_gpgcheck: 1 enabled: true name: New Relic Infrastructure write_files: - content: | --- # New Relic config file license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY path: /etc/newrelic-infra.yml packages: - newrelic-infra - nri-* runcmd: - [ yum, install, newrelic-infra, -y ] - [ systemctl, daemon-reload ] - [ systemctl, enable, newrelic-infra.service ] - [ systemctl, start, --no-block, newrelic-infra.service ] --MIMEBOUNDARY Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Type: text/x-shellscript Mime-Version: 1.0 #!/bin/bash # ECS config { echo \"ECS_CLUSTER=YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" } >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config start ecs echo \"Done\" --MIMEBOUNDARY-- Copy CentOS 7, RHEL 7, Amazon Linux 2 Replace the highlighted fields with relevant values: Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=\"MIMEBOUNDARY\" MIME-Version: 1.0 --MIMEBOUNDARY Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"init.cfg\" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Type: text/cloud-config Mime-Version: 1.0 yum_repos: newrelic-infra: baseurl: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/linux/yum/el/7/x86_64 gpgkey: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/gpg/newrelic-infra.gpg gpgcheck: 1 repo_gpgcheck: 1 enabled: true name: New Relic Infrastructure write_files: - content: | --- # New Relic config file license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY path: /etc/newrelic-infra.yml packages: - newrelic-infra - nri-* runcmd: - [ yum, install, newrelic-infra, -y ] - [ systemctl, daemon-reload ] - [ systemctl, enable, newrelic-infra.service ] - [ systemctl, start, --no-block, newrelic-infra.service ] --MIMEBOUNDARY Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Type: text/x-shellscript Mime-Version: 1.0 #!/bin/bash # ECS config { echo \"ECS_CLUSTER=YOUR_ECS_CLUSTER_NAME\" } >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config start ecs echo \"Done\" --MIMEBOUNDARY-- Copy Choose Skip to review. Choose Create launch configuration. Next, update the auto scaling group: Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Auto scaling groups. Select the auto scaling group you want to update. From the Actions menu, choose Edit. In the drop-down menu for Launch configuration, select the new launch configuration created. Click Save. To test if the agent is automatically detecting instances, terminate an EC2 instance in the auto scaling group: the replacement instance will now be launched with the new user data. After five minutes, you should see data from the new host on the Hosts page. Next, move on to enabling the monitoring of services. Step 2: Enable monitoring of services Once you've enabled EC2 to run the infrastructure agent, the agent starts monitoring the containers running on that host. Next, we'll explain how to monitor services deployed on ECS. For example, you can monitor an ECS task containing an NGINX instance that sits in front of your application server. Here's a brief overview of how you'd monitor a supported service deployed on ECS: Create a YAML configuration file for the service you want to monitor. This will eventually be placed in the EC2 user data section via the AWS console. But before doing that, you can test that the config is working by placing that file in the infrastructure agent folder (etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d) in EC2. That config file must use our container auto-discovery format, which allows it to automatically find containers. The exact config options will depend on the specific integration. Check to see that data from the service is being reported to New Relic. If you are satisfied with the data you see, you can then use the EC2 console to add that configuration to the appropriate launch configuration, in the write_files section, and then update the auto scaling group. In the runcmd section, add the yum command to install the integration to the appropriate launch configuration. Here's a detailed example of doing the above procedure for NGINX: Ensure you have SSH access to the server or access to AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. Log in to the host running the infrastructure agent. Via the command line, change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Create a file called nginx-config.yml and add the following snippet: --- discovery: docker: match: image: /nginx/ integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}:/status REMOTE_MONITORING: true METRICS: 1 Copy This configuration causes the infrastructure agent to look for containers in ECS that contain nginx. Once a container matches, it then connects to the NGINX status page. For details on how the discovery.ip snippet works, see auto-discovery. For details on general NGINX configuration, see the NGINX integration. If your NGINX status page is set to serve requests from the STATUS_URL on port 80, the infrastructure agent starts monitoring it. After five minutes, verify that NGINX data is appearing in the Infrastructure UI (either: one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third party services, or one.newrelic.com > Explorer > On-host). If the configuration works, place it in the EC2 launch configuration: Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Launch configurations. On the next page, select the launch configuration you want to update. Right click and select Copy launch configuration. On the Launch configuration details tab, click Edit details. In the User data section, edit the write_files section (in the part marked text/cloud-config). Add a new file/content entry: - content: | --- discovery: docker: match: image: /nginx/ integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}:/status REMOTE_MONITORING: true METRICS: 1 path: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nginx-config.yml Copy Also edit the runcmd section to include the yum command to install nri-nginx: runcmd: - [ yum, install, newrelic-infra, -y ] - [ yum, install, nri-nginx, -y ] - [ systemctl, daemon-reload ] - [ systemctl, enable, newrelic-infra.service ] - [ systemctl, start, --no-block, newrelic-infra.service ] Copy Choose Skip to review. Choose Create launch configuration. Next, update the auto scaling group: Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Auto scaling groups. Select the auto scaling group you want to update. From the Actions menu, choose Edit. In the drop down menu for Launch configuration, select the new launch configuration created. Click Save. When an EC2 instance is terminated, it is replaced with a new one that automatically looks for new NGINX containers.",

We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

This is the number reported by tools such as top(1) and ps(1). Keyspace metrics The Redis integration collects the following keyspace metadata and metrics. These attributes are attached to the RedisKeyspaceSample event type: Name Description db.avgTtl The average time to live (TTL) in milliseconds of keys that have an expiration set in the database being reported on. db.keys Number of keys in the database being reported on. db.keyspace Redis database index, which is the integer number (usually a number between 0 and 15). Format: db followed by the database index. For example: db0, db1, db2, etc. db.expires Number of keys with an expiration in the database being reported on. Inventory data Inventory data includes everything reported by the Redis CONFIG GET command, with the exception of requirepass, which stores the password to the Redis server. For more on inventory data, see Understand inventory data.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified.

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

This is the number reported by tools such as top(1) and ps(1). Keyspace metrics The Redis integration collects the following keyspace metadata and metrics. These attributes are attached to the RedisKeyspaceSample event type: Name Description db.avgTtl The average time to live (TTL) in milliseconds of keys that have an expiration set in the database being reported on. db.keys Number of keys in the database being reported on. db.keyspace Redis database index, which is the integer number (usually a number between 0 and 15). Format: db followed by the database index. For example: db0, db1, db2, etc. db.expires Number of keys with an expiration in the database being reported on. Inventory data Inventory data includes everything reported by the Redis CONFIG GET command, with the exception of requirepass, which stores the password to the Redis server. For more on inventory data, see Understand inventory data.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration file integration_name: com.newrelic.postgresql instances: # A name for the collection - name: sample_postgres # The only supported command is all_data. command: all_data arguments: # The username for the Postgres instance. Required. username: postgres # The password for the Postgres instance. Required. password: pass # The hostname for the Postgres instance. Defaults to localhost. hostname: psql-sample.localnet # The port of the Postgres instance. If PgBouncer is being used, # use the port it is running on.

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

This is the number reported by tools such as top(1) and ps(1). Keyspace metrics The Redis integration collects the following keyspace metadata and metrics. These attributes are attached to the RedisKeyspaceSample event type: Name Description db.avgTtl The average time to live (TTL) in milliseconds of keys that have an expiration set in the database being reported on. db.keys Number of keys in the database being reported on. db.keyspace Redis database index, which is the integer number (usually a number between 0 and 15). Format: db followed by the database index. For example: db0, db1, db2, etc. db.expires Number of keys with an expiration in the database being reported on. Inventory data Inventory data includes everything reported by the Redis CONFIG GET command, with the exception of requirepass, which stores the password to the Redis server. For more on inventory data, see Understand inventory data. Other system data The Redis integration collects these additional attributes about your Redis service: Name Description software.version The version of the Redis server. Example: 3.2.3. cluster.role Either master or slave, depending on the role of the Redis node being monitored. Check the source code This integration is open source software.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration file integration_name: com.newrelic.postgresql instances: # A name for the collection - name: sample_postgres # The only supported command is all_data. command: all_data arguments: # The username for the Postgres instance. Required. username: postgres # The password for the Postgres instance. Required. password: pass # The hostname for the Postgres instance. Defaults to localhost. hostname: psql-sample.localnet # The port of the Postgres instance. If PgBouncer is being used, # use the port it is running on.

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

      "body": "If you have services that run on Docker containers in Amazon ECS (like Cassandra, Redis, MySQL, and other supported services), you can use New Relic to report data from those services, from the host, and from the containers. Requirements To monitor services running on ECS, you must meet these requirements: An auto-scaling ECS cluster running Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL that meets the infrastructure agent compatibility and requirements. ECS tasks must have network mode set to none or bridge (awsvpc and host not supported). A supported service running on ECS that meets our integration requirements: Apache (does not report inventory data) Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ (does not report inventory data) Redis SNMP How to enable Before explaining how to enable monitoring of services running in ECS, here's an overview of the process: Enable Amazon EC2 to install our infrastructure agent on your ECS clusters. Enable monitoring of services using a service-specific configuration file. Step 1: Enable EC2 to install the infrastructure agent First, you must enable Amazon EC2 to install our infrastructure agent on ECS clusters. To do this, you'll first need to update your user data to install the infrastructure agent on launch. Here are instructions for changing EC2 launch configuration (taken from Amazon EC2 documentation): Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Launch configurations. On the next page, select the launch configuration you want to update. Right click and select Copy launch configuration. On the Launch configuration details tab, click Edit details. Replace user data with one of the following snippets: For CentOS 6, RHEL 6, Amazon Linux 1 Replace the highlighted fields with relevant values: Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=\"MIMEBOUNDARY\" MIME-Version: 1.0 --MIMEBOUNDARY Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"init.cfg\" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Type: text/cloud-config Mime-Version: 1.0 yum_repos: newrelic-infra: baseurl: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/linux/yum/el/6/x86_64 gpgkey: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/gpg/newrelic-infra.gpg gpgcheck: 1 repo_gpgcheck: 1 enabled: true name: New Relic Infrastructure write_files: - content: | --- # New Relic config file license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY path: /etc/newrelic-infra.yml packages: - newrelic-infra - nri-* runcmd: - [ yum, install, newrelic-infra, -y ] - [ systemctl, daemon-reload ] - [ systemctl, enable, newrelic-infra.service ] - [ systemctl, start, --no-block, newrelic-infra.service ] --MIMEBOUNDARY Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Type: text/x-shellscript Mime-Version: 1.0 #!/bin/bash # ECS config { echo \"ECS_CLUSTER=YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" } >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config start ecs echo \"Done\" --MIMEBOUNDARY-- Copy CentOS 7, RHEL 7, Amazon Linux 2 Replace the highlighted fields with relevant values: Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=\"MIMEBOUNDARY\" MIME-Version: 1.0 --MIMEBOUNDARY Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"init.cfg\" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Type: text/cloud-config Mime-Version: 1.0 yum_repos: newrelic-infra: baseurl: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/linux/yum/el/7/x86_64 gpgkey: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/gpg/newrelic-infra.gpg gpgcheck: 1 repo_gpgcheck: 1 enabled: true name: New Relic Infrastructure write_files: - content: | --- # New Relic config file license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY path: /etc/newrelic-infra.yml packages: - newrelic-infra - nri-* runcmd: - [ yum, install, newrelic-infra, -y ] - [ systemctl, daemon-reload ] - [ systemctl, enable, newrelic-infra.service ] - [ systemctl, start, --no-block, newrelic-infra.service ] --MIMEBOUNDARY Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Type: text/x-shellscript Mime-Version: 1.0 #!/bin/bash # ECS config { echo \"ECS_CLUSTER=YOUR_ECS_CLUSTER_NAME\" } >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config start ecs echo \"Done\" --MIMEBOUNDARY-- Copy Choose Skip to review. Choose Create launch configuration. Next, update the auto scaling group: Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Auto scaling groups. Select the auto scaling group you want to update. From the Actions menu, choose Edit. In the drop-down menu for Launch configuration, select the new launch configuration created. Click Save. To test if the agent is automatically detecting instances, terminate an EC2 instance in the auto scaling group: the replacement instance will now be launched with the new user data. After five minutes, you should see data from the new host on the Hosts page. Next, move on to enabling the monitoring of services. Step 2: Enable monitoring of services Once you've enabled EC2 to run the infrastructure agent, the agent starts monitoring the containers running on that host. Next, we'll explain how to monitor services deployed on ECS. For example, you can monitor an ECS task containing an NGINX instance that sits in front of your application server. Here's a brief overview of how you'd monitor a supported service deployed on ECS: Create a YAML configuration file for the service you want to monitor. This will eventually be placed in the EC2 user data section via the AWS console. But before doing that, you can test that the config is working by placing that file in the infrastructure agent folder (etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d) in EC2. That config file must use our container auto-discovery format, which allows it to automatically find containers. The exact config options will depend on the specific integration. Check to see that data from the service is being reported to New Relic. If you are satisfied with the data you see, you can then use the EC2 console to add that configuration to the appropriate launch configuration, in the write_files section, and then update the auto scaling group. In the runcmd section, add the yum command to install the integration to the appropriate launch configuration. Here's a detailed example of doing the above procedure for NGINX: Ensure you have SSH access to the server or access to AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. Log in to the host running the infrastructure agent. Via the command line, change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Create a file called nginx-config.yml and add the following snippet: --- discovery: docker: match: image: /nginx/ integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}:/status REMOTE_MONITORING: true METRICS: 1 Copy This configuration causes the infrastructure agent to look for containers in ECS that contain nginx. Once a container matches, it then connects to the NGINX status page. For details on how the discovery.ip snippet works, see auto-discovery. For details on general NGINX configuration, see the NGINX integration. If your NGINX status page is set to serve requests from the STATUS_URL on port 80, the infrastructure agent starts monitoring it. After five minutes, verify that NGINX data is appearing in the Infrastructure UI (either: one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third party services, or one.newrelic.com > Explorer > On-host). If the configuration works, place it in the EC2 launch configuration: Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Launch configurations. On the next page, select the launch configuration you want to update. Right click and select Copy launch configuration. On the Launch configuration details tab, click Edit details. In the User data section, edit the write_files section (in the part marked text/cloud-config). Add a new file/content entry: - content: | --- discovery: docker: match: image: /nginx/ integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}:/status REMOTE_MONITORING: true METRICS: 1 path: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nginx-config.yml Copy Also edit the runcmd section to include the yum command to install nri-nginx: runcmd: - [ yum, install, newrelic-infra, -y ] - [ yum, install, nri-nginx, -y ] - [ systemctl, daemon-reload ] - [ systemctl, enable, newrelic-infra.service ] - [ systemctl, start, --no-block, newrelic-infra.service ] Copy Choose Skip to review. Choose Create launch configuration. Next, update the auto scaling group: Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Auto scaling groups. Select the auto scaling group you want to update. From the Actions menu, choose Edit. In the drop down menu for Launch configuration, select the new launch configuration created. Click Save. When an EC2 instance is terminated, it is replaced with a new one that automatically looks for new NGINX containers.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file.

      "body": "If you have services that run on Docker containers in Amazon ECS (like Cassandra, Redis, MySQL, and other supported services), you can use New Relic to report data from those services, from the host, and from the containers. Requirements To monitor services running on ECS, you must meet these requirements: An auto-scaling ECS cluster running Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL that meets the infrastructure agent compatibility and requirements. ECS tasks must have network mode set to none or bridge (awsvpc and host not supported). A supported service running on ECS that meets our integration requirements: Apache (does not report inventory data) Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ (does not report inventory data) Redis SNMP How to enable Before explaining how to enable monitoring of services running in ECS, here's an overview of the process: Enable Amazon EC2 to install our infrastructure agent on your ECS clusters. Enable monitoring of services using a service-specific configuration file. Step 1: Enable EC2 to install the infrastructure agent First, you must enable Amazon EC2 to install our infrastructure agent on ECS clusters. To do this, you'll first need to update your user data to install the infrastructure agent on launch. Here are instructions for changing EC2 launch configuration (taken from Amazon EC2 documentation): Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Launch configurations. On the next page, select the launch configuration you want to update. Right click and select Copy launch configuration. On the Launch configuration details tab, click Edit details.

Choose Create launch configuration. Next, update the auto scaling group: Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Auto scaling groups. Select the auto scaling group you want to update. From the Actions menu, choose Edit. In the drop-down menu for Launch configuration, select the new launch configuration created. Click Save. To test if the agent is automatically detecting instances, terminate an EC2 instance in the auto scaling group: the replacement instance will now be launched with the new user data. After five minutes, you should see data from the new host on the Hosts page. Next, move on to enabling the monitoring of services. Step 2: Enable monitoring of services Once you've enabled EC2 to run the infrastructure agent, the agent starts monitoring the containers running on that host. Next, we'll explain how to monitor services deployed on ECS. For example, you can monitor an ECS task containing an NGINX instance that sits in front of your application server. Here's a brief overview of how you'd monitor a supported service deployed on ECS: Create a YAML configuration file for the service you want to monitor. This will eventually be placed in the EC2 user data section via the AWS console. But before doing that, you can test that the config is working by placing that file in the infrastructure agent folder (etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d) in EC2. That config file must use our container auto-discovery format, which allows it to automatically find containers. The exact config options will depend on the specific integration. Check to see that data from the service is being reported to New Relic. If you are satisfied with the data you see, you can then use the EC2 console to add that configuration to the appropriate launch configuration, in the write_files section, and then update the auto scaling group. In the runcmd section, add the yum command to install the integration to the appropriate launch configuration. Here's a detailed example of doing the above procedure for NGINX: Ensure you have SSH access to the server or access to AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. Log in to the host running the infrastructure agent. Via the command line, change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Create a file called nginx-config.yml and add the following snippet: --- discovery: docker: match: image: /nginx/ integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}:/status REMOTE_MONITORING: true METRICS: 1 Copy This configuration causes the infrastructure agent to look for containers in ECS that contain nginx. Once a container matches, it then connects to the NGINX status page. For details on how the discovery.ip snippet works, see auto-discovery. For details on general NGINX configuration, see the NGINX integration. If your NGINX status page is set to serve requests from the STATUS_URL on port 80, the infrastructure agent starts monitoring it. After five minutes, verify that NGINX data is appearing in the Infrastructure UI (either: one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third party services, or one.newrelic.com > Explorer > On-host). If the configuration works, place it in the EC2 launch configuration: Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Launch configurations. On the next page, select the launch configuration you want to update. Right click and select Copy launch configuration. On the Launch configuration details tab, click Edit details. In the User data section, edit the write_files section (in the part marked text/cloud-config). Add a new file/content entry: - content: | --- discovery: docker: match: image: /nginx/ integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}:/status REMOTE_MONITORING: true METRICS: 1 path: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nginx-config.yml Copy Also edit the runcmd section to include the yum command to install nri-nginx: runcmd: - [ yum, install, newrelic-infra, -y ] - [ yum, install, nri-nginx, -y ] - [ systemctl, daemon-reload ] - [ systemctl, enable, newrelic-infra.service ] - [ systemctl, start, --no-block, newrelic-infra.service ] Copy Choose Skip to review. Choose Create launch configuration. Next, update the auto scaling group: Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Auto scaling groups. Select the auto scaling group you want to update. From the Actions menu, choose Edit. In the drop down menu for Launch configuration, select the new launch configuration created. Click Save. When an EC2 instance is terminated, it is replaced with a new one that automatically looks for new NGINX containers.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

This is the number reported by tools such as top(1) and ps(1). Keyspace metrics The Redis integration collects the following keyspace metadata and metrics. These attributes are attached to the RedisKeyspaceSample event type: Name Description db.avgTtl The average time to live (TTL) in milliseconds of keys that have an expiration set in the database being reported on. db.keys Number of keys in the database being reported on. db.keyspace Redis database index, which is the integer number (usually a number between 0 and 15). Format: db followed by the database index. For example: db0, db1, db2, etc. db.expires Number of keys with an expiration in the database being reported on. Inventory data Inventory data includes everything reported by the Redis CONFIG GET command, with the exception of requirepass, which stores the password to the Redis server. For more on inventory data, see Understand inventory data.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Microsoft SQL Server integration links.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file.

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

This is the number reported by tools such as top(1) and ps(1). Keyspace metrics The Redis integration collects the following keyspace metadata and metrics. These attributes are attached to the RedisKeyspaceSample event type: Name Description db.avgTtl The average time to live (TTL) in milliseconds of keys that have an expiration set in the database being reported on. db.keys Number of keys in the database being reported on. db.keyspace Redis database index, which is the integer number (usually a number between 0 and 15). Format: db followed by the database index. For example: db0, db1, db2, etc. db.expires Number of keys with an expiration in the database being reported on. Inventory data Inventory data includes everything reported by the Redis CONFIG GET command, with the exception of requirepass, which stores the password to the Redis server. For more on inventory data, see Understand inventory data.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Microsoft SQL Server integration links.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file.

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Redis integration collects the following metric data attributes: Redis sample metrics These attributes are attached to the RedisSample event type: Name Description cluster.connectedSlaves Number of connected slaves. db.aofLastRewriteTimeInMilliseconds Duration of the last AOF rewrite operation in milliseconds. db.aofLastBgrewriteStatus Boolean representing status of the last AOF background rewrite operation. db.aofLastWriteStatus Boolean representing status of the last AOF write operation. db.evictedKeysPerSecond Number of evicted keys due to maxmemory limit per second. db.expiredKeysPerSecond Number of key expiration events per second. db.keyspaceHitsPerSecond Number of successful lookups of keys in the main dictionary per second. db.keyspaceMissesPerSecond Number of failed lookup of keys in the main dictionary per second. db.latestForkUsecMilliseconds Duration of the latest fork operation in milliseconds. db.rdbBgsaveInProgress Boolean.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Microsoft SQL Server integration links.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with F5 BIG-IP 11.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with the infrastructure agent. F5 BIG-IP user account with Access Auditor-level user privileges and iControl REST API access permissions. F5 BIG-IP users and privileges To create a new user and assign user permissions: Create a user account with, at minimum, Access Auditor-level permissions. For instructions, see the F5 official documentation. Once the user has been created, assign the user iControl REST user permissions. Tip Administrator-level permissions may be required to collect some system sample metrics or system inventory configuration data. For more information on user permission levels, see User role access descriptions. Tip For detailed information on iControl users and permission, download and review the iControl REST User Guide. Install and activate To install the F5 BIG-IP integration, choose your setup: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-f5. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp f5-config.yml.sample f5-config.yml Copy Edit the f5-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-f5 MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-f5/nri-f5-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-f5-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy f5-config.yml.sample f5-config.yml Copy Edit the f5-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: We recommend you install the integration on a separate server and monitor F5 remotely. Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example of the configuration file, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The f5-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metrics for the BIG-IP instance. inventory: collects only the inventory (configuration) data for the BIG-IP instance. metrics: collects only the metrics data for the BIG-IP instance. Arguments The f5-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: username: The username for the F5 BIG-IP connection. This field is required. password: The password for the F5 BIG-IP connection. This field is required. hostname: The hostname for the F5 BIG-IP connection. Default: f5-host. port: The port on which F5 BIG-IP instance is running. Default: 443. timeout: The number of seconds to wait before a request times out. Default: 30. ca_bundle_file: Alternative certificate authority bundle file. ca_bundle_dir: Alternative certificate authority bundle directory. partition_filter: An array of the partitions to collect from, in JSON. Default: '[\"Common\"]'.

      "body": "In order to report request queuing, New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). These examples use the X-Request-Start header, since it is has broader support across platforms. If this does not work with your server configuration for request queuing, try using the X-Queue-Start header. The syntax should otherwise be the same. Apache Apache's mod_headers module includes a %t variable that is formatted correctly. To enable request queue reporting, add this code to your Apache config: RequestHeader set X-Request-Start \"%t\" Copy Nginx If you are using Nginx version 1.2.6 or higher and the latest version of the Ruby, Python, or PHP agent, Nginx can easily be configured to report queue time. (For Nginx versions 1.2.6 or lower, you must recompile Nginx with a module or patch.) Configuring with Nginx 1.2.6 or higher uses the ${msec} variable, which is a number in seconds with milliseconds resolution. For more information, see http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#variables. Add the appropriate information to your Nginx config: Nginx configuration Values General Nginx use proxy_set_header X-Request-Start \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Passenger Version 5 or higher: >passenger_set_header X-REQUEST-START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Older versions: passenger_set_cgi_param X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy fastcgi fastcgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy uWSGI uwsgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy F5 load balancers For F5 load balancers, use this configuration snippet: when HTTP_REQUEST_SEND { # TCL 8.4 so we have to calculate the time in millisecond resolution # Calculation from: https://groups.google.com/forum/? fromgroups=#!topic/comp.lang.tcl/tV9H6TDv0t8 set secs [clock seconds] set ms [clock clicks -milliseconds] set base [expr { $secs * 1000 }] set fract [expr { $ms - $base }] if { $fract >= 1000 } { set diff [expr { $fract / 1000 }] incr secs $diff incr fract [expr { -1000 * $diff }] } set micros [format \"%d%03d000\" $secs $fract] # Want this header inserted as if coming from the client clientside { HTTP::header insert X-Request-Start \"t=${micros}\" } } Copy Network timing Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time in your Browser data. This is because the front-end server does not add the queuing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. The queuing time headers can never account for backlog in the listener socket used to accept requests. For example, if the front-end server's configuration results in a backlog of requests that queue in the listener socket, page load timing will show an increase in network time.",

      "body": "Instrument your systems and send telemetry data to New Relic with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click the Guided install button. If your account reports data through our EU datacenter, click EU Guided install. Guided install EU Guided install Our infrastructure agent discovers the applications and infrastructure and log sources running in your environment, and recommends which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Supported APM agents If you have a .NET Windows application on IIS, the guided install configures and enables an APM agent. Guided install for .NET EU Guided install for .NET Why it matters With our guided install, you can instrument your applications and infrastructure and start seeing your data in New Relic in minutes. The guided install uses our command line interface (CLI), the infrastructure agent for your host environment, and a library of installation recipes to instrument your applications and infrastructure for you. That means less toil for you. Because our instrumentation recipes are open source, you can modify existing recipes, or build new ones, to suit your needs. Some technical detail The New Relic guided install uses open source installation recipes to instrument on-host integrations. These recipes include installation and setup commands, information about logs, and metadata related to what’s being installed. They're collected in a YAML file for each type of system and have all of the installation details necessary to install the infrastructure agent for a specific integration. Important On Windows, our guided install only supports Microsoft SQL Server, logs, and the infrastructure agent. All other integrations are only supported on Linux. On-host integration (OHI) recipes The guided install automates the discovery, configuration, and installation of OHIs. However, there may be times when you want to instrument them one-by-one using the CLI install command. To install any individual on-host integration, run this command: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=API_KEY NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=ACCOUNT_ID /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n INTEGRATION-FLAG Copy For example: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=<API_KEY> NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID> /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n apache-open-source-integration Copy The table lists the integrations supported by the guided install CLI command. The specific on-host integration commands are provided for your reference. Our open source integrations send performance metrics and inventory data from your servers and applications to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts.

MySQL: Incorrect user permissions To monitor MySQL health data, you need a valid username and password with specific permissions. These commands will create a user and grant the required permissions: Create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD';\" Copy Give replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Give select privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Once done, your next guided install attempt should work. NGINX: No status URL To monitor your NGINX server, you'll need to configure a valid status URL. status_url: The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. If the default value of 127.0.0.1 is incorrect, substitute the address/FQDN/URL for your system. Example: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status You can read more about the status_url in these NGINX docs: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module There are different ways to set status_url, depending on how NGINX was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: See Monitor services running on Kubernetes.

      "body": "After you import OpenTelemetry data into New Relic, you can use a variety of tools to analyze it. Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Explorer. In the left sidebar, click Services - OpenTelemetry: Click the service you want to know more about. If you need help understanding the data, see the explanations which follow. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in your application's response time. To get a list of transactions: From the Transaction Summary page, select the transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals capture calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On the Errors page, you can see total errors as well as charts showing error count and error rate. Logs The Logs page displays logs from your application. For more information about how to associate log data to your application in New Relic, see our OpenTelemetry and logging documentation. Metrics explorer For selected OpenTelemetry languages, you can see information about your metrics in this section. Also, if you are using the Prometheus exporter with OpenTelemetry, you can view your metric data here. Data explorer and query builder Explore your metrics and traces using the data explorer, or write your own queries in query builder using NRQL. For more on how to query your data once it's in New Relic, see Query your data and Introduction to NRQL.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Microsoft SQL Server integration links.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file.

Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file. (The install process includes setting some of these.) Config commands include: metrics metrics reports the metric data and accepts the following arguments: hostname: Redis server hostname. Default value: localhost. port: Port where Redis server is listening. Default value: 6379. unix_socket_path: Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Default value: None. use_unix_socket: uses the unix_socket_path value to help you to uniquely identify the Redis instances when there are more than one on the same host using Unix sockets. Default value: false. keys: list of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Default value: None. See keyspace config for more information. keys_limit: max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Default value: 30. For more information, see About this integration and Keyspace metrics configuration. password: password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only if your Redis server is password-protected. Default value: None. config_inventory: set it to false to avoid invoking the CONFIG GET Redis command. This option is useful in managed environments without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache). Default value: true inventory inventory captures all the Redis configuration parameters, with the exception of requirepass. To disable collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. keyspace If you want to see metrics related to the length of selected keys, specify the keys parameter in single-line JSON format in redis-config.yml. For example: keys: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy If your selected keys are stored only in Redis database 0, then you can set the keys parameter as follows: keys: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' Copy The keys_limit parameter defaults to 30 for performance reasons. Be aware that increasing this number could have a substantial impact on your Redis server performance. To see the keyspace metric data that is collected, see RedisKeyspaceSample. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. Type String Default localhost Example: HOSTNAME='Redis DB' Copy PORT The port where Redis server is listening. Type Integer Default 6379 Example: PORT=7199 Copy UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Unix socket path on which Redis server is listening (if set). Type String Default (none) Example: UNIX_SOCKET_PATH='tpf_unix_sock.server' Copy KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. Type JSON Default (none) Example: KEYS='{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_2\"]}' Copy KEYS_LIMIT Max number of the keys to retrieve their lengths. Type Integer Default 30 Example: KEYS_LIMIT=50 Copy PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Type String Default (none) Example: PASSWORD='Hhv*$jIV' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Important If you want to monitor several Redis instances from a single host you will need to duplicate the name block, adding arguments for your extra instances. For more information, see our configuration file examples. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

This is the number reported by tools such as top(1) and ps(1). Keyspace metrics The Redis integration collects the following keyspace metadata and metrics. These attributes are attached to the RedisKeyspaceSample event type: Name Description db.avgTtl The average time to live (TTL) in milliseconds of keys that have an expiration set in the database being reported on. db.keys Number of keys in the database being reported on. db.keyspace Redis database index, which is the integer number (usually a number between 0 and 15). Format: db followed by the database index. For example: db0, db1, db2, etc. db.expires Number of keys with an expiration in the database being reported on. Inventory data Inventory data includes everything reported by the Redis CONFIG GET command, with the exception of requirepass, which stores the password to the Redis server. For more on inventory data, see Understand inventory data.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance.. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. password: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. hostname: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: localhost. port: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: 5432. collection_list: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' Copy JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' Copy ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' Copy pgbouncer: collect pgbouncer metrics. Default: false. enable_ssl: determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. Default: false. ssl_root_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. ssl_cert_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. ssl_key_location: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. timeout: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 10. database: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: postgres. custom_metrics_query: a SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. custom_metrics_config: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. collect_db_lock_metrics: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true. collect_bloat_metrics: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: true.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Microsoft SQL Server integration links.

      "body": "From a New Relic perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything New Relic can identify that has data you can monitor. Integrations can be configured to create their own entity, called a remote entity, by setting the remote_monitoring option to true. If set to false, an integration will be considered a local entity, and the data related to it will be attached to the host entity that the agent creates. Remote monitoring requires infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher. For the Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, and Redis integrations, remote monitoring (and multi-tenancy) is enabled by activating the configuration parameter remote_monitoring. Important If your Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, or Redis service is located in the same host as the agent, when you activate remote monitoring the resulting entity will be considered as remote, regardless of its actual location. This may affect alerts, alter attributes, and have other effects, as explained here. Effects of activating remote_monitoring By enabling remote_monitoring, the integration becomes a different entity which is no longer attached to the infrastructure agent. As a result, the following items may be affected: Alert verification Enabling remote monitoring can affect your configured alerts in case they are using any of the values that are affected by this new feature. We strongly recommend checking your existing alerts to make sure they keep on working as expected. New entity attributes These attributes are modified in the resulting entity: Display name: New entity unique key (instead of using the display name) Entity GUID: New entity GUID Entity ID: New entity ID Entity key: New entity unique key (instead of using the display name) External key: Using integration entity name (instead of using the agent display) Changes in recorded metrics When remote monitoring is enabled, we will add the hostname and port values to all metrics. If the nricluster name or nriservice are defined in the integration configuration file, they will also be decorated. Unrecorded attributes Since the integration is now an independent entity which is not attached to the agent, the following agent attributes are not collected: agentName agentVersion coreCount criticalViolationCount fullHostname instanceType kernelVersion linuxDistribution entityType operatingSystem processorCount systemMemoryBytes warningViolationCount Your custom attributes Updated hostname For the ApacheSample, RedisSample, CassandraSample, and NginxSample integration metrics, we will use the integration configuration hostname instead of the short hostname from the agent. When the integration hostname is a loopback address, the agent will replace it in order to guarantee uniqueness.",

To filter the alert to Kubernetes entities that only have the chosen attributes, select Filter. Select the threshold settings. For more on the Trigger an alert when... options, see Alert types. Select an existing alert policy, or create a new one. Select Create. When an alert condition's threshold is triggered, New Relic sends a notification to the policy's notification channels. Use the predefined alert types and thresholds The Kubernetes integration comes with its own alert policy and alert conditions. To see what the predefined alert conditions are, see Kubernetes integration: Predefined alert policy. In addition, you can create an alert condition for any metric collected by any New Relic integration you use, including the Kubernetes integration: Select the alert type Integrations. From the Select a data source dropdown, select a Kubernetes (K8s) data source. Select alert notifications When an alert condition's threshold is triggered, New Relic sends a message to the notification channel(s) chosen in the alert policy. Depending on the type of notification, you may have the following options: View the incident. Acknowledge the incident. Go to a chart of the incident data by selecting the identifier name. The entity identifier that triggered the alert appears near the top of the notification message. The format of the identifier depends on the alert type: Available pods are less than desired pods alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:replicaset:REPLICASET_NAME Copy CPU or memory usage alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:POD_NAME:container:CONTAINER_NAME Copy Here are some examples. Pod alert notification example For Available pods are less than desired pods alerts, the ID of the ReplicaSet triggering the issue might look like this: k8s:beam-production:default:replicaset:nginx-deployment-1623441481 Copy This identifier contains the following information: Cluster name: beam-production Parent namespace: default ReplicaSet name: nginx-deployment-1623441481 Container resource notification example For container CPU or memory usage alerts, the entity might look like this: k8s:beam-production:kube-system:kube-state-metrics-797bb87c75-zncwn:container:kube-state-metrics Copy This identifier contains the following information: Cluster name: beam-production Parent namespace: kube-system Pod namespace: kube-state-metrics-797bb87c75-zncwn Container name: kube-state-metrics Create alert conditions using NRQL Follow standard procedures to create alert conditions for NRQL queries.

      "body": "Read on to learn how New Relic on-host integrations collect and report data to New Relic. Data collection and reporting process This is how an infrastructure on-host integration sends data to New Relic: On startup, the infrastructure agent scans the directory that contains the integration's definition files. The infrastructure agent registers every integration executable defined in the definition file. The agent scans a dedicated directory for integration configuration files. If those config files specify integrations that have been registered with the infrastructure agent, the agent sets up and schedules the integrations. At the scheduled interval (the default is 15 seconds), the agent harvests the data from the integration and prepares it for transmission. Every 60 seconds, it sends that data to New Relic, along with any other infrastructure data. After a successful collection pass, the integration executable exits. File structure and specifications Understanding the file structure of New Relic on-host integrations can help you customize your integration, understand and use your data, and troubleshoot problems. On-host integrations adhere to a set of open source specifications, allowing anyone to build their own infrastructure on-host integration.

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user.

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

Our integration collects Kubernetes data by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. For a simpler and more visual experience, use the cluster explorer. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can query your Kubernetes data and create clear visualizations. Query Kubernetes data The simplest way to query your Kubernetes data is using the query builder, which accepts NRQL queries in its advanced mode. Alternatively, you can use the NerdGraph API to retrieve Kubernetes data. Event types Kubernetes data is attached to the following event types: Event name Type of Kubernetes data Available since K8sNodeSample Node data v1.0.0 K8sNamespaceSample Namespace data v1.0.0 K8sDeploymentSample Deployment data v1.0.0 K8sReplicasetSample ReplicaSet data v1.0.0 K8sDaemonsetSample DaemonSet data v1.13.0 K8sStatefulsetSample StatefulSet data v1.13.0 K8sPodSample Pod data v1.0.0 K8sClusterSample Cluster data v1.0.0 K8sContainerSample Container data v1.0.0 K8sVolumeSample Volume data v1.0.0 K8sApiServerSample API server data v1.11.0 K8sControllerManagerSample Controller manager data v1.11.0 K8sSchedulerSample Scheduler data v1.11.0 K8sEtcdSample ETCD data v1.11.0 K8sEndpointSample Endpoint data v1.13.0 K8sServiceSample Service data v1.13.0 K8sHpaSample Horizontal Pod Autoscaler data v2.3.0 Manage alerts You can be notified about alert violations for your Kubernetes data: Create an alert condition To create an alert condition for the Kubernetes integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts > Kubernetes, then select Create alert condition. To filter the alert to Kubernetes entities that only have the chosen attributes, select Filter. Select the threshold settings. For more on the Trigger an alert when... options, see Alert types. Select an existing alert policy, or create a new one. Select Create. When an alert condition's threshold is triggered, New Relic sends a notification to the policy's notification channels. Use the predefined alert types and thresholds The Kubernetes integration comes with its own alert policy and alert conditions. To see what the predefined alert conditions are, see Kubernetes integration: Predefined alert policy. In addition, you can create an alert condition for any metric collected by any New Relic integration you use, including the Kubernetes integration: Select the alert type Integrations. From the Select a data source dropdown, select a Kubernetes (K8s) data source. Select alert notifications When an alert condition's threshold is triggered, New Relic sends a message to the notification channel(s) chosen in the alert policy. Depending on the type of notification, you may have the following options: View the incident. Acknowledge the incident. Go to a chart of the incident data by selecting the identifier name. The entity identifier that triggered the alert appears near the top of the notification message. The format of the identifier depends on the alert type: Available pods are less than desired pods alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:replicaset:REPLICASET_NAME Copy CPU or memory usage alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:POD_NAME:container:CONTAINER_NAME Copy Here are some examples. Pod alert notification example For Available pods are less than desired pods alerts, the ID of the ReplicaSet triggering the issue might look like this: k8s:beam-production:default:replicaset:nginx-deployment-1623441481 Copy This identifier contains the following information: Cluster name: beam-production Parent namespace: default ReplicaSet name: nginx-deployment-1623441481 Container resource notification example For container CPU or memory usage alerts, the entity might look like this: k8s:beam-production:kube-system:kube-state-metrics-797bb87c75-zncwn:container:kube-state-metrics Copy This identifier contains the following information: Cluster name: beam-production Parent namespace: kube-system Pod namespace: kube-state-metrics-797bb87c75-zncwn Container name: kube-state-metrics Create alert conditions using NRQL Follow standard procedures to create alert conditions for NRQL queries.

      "body": "Our cloud integrations get data from cloud provider APIs. In New Relic, you can change some of the data collection-related settings for your cloud integrations. Read on to see what changes you can make and the reasons for making them. Tip To use integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Overview of settings New Relic cloud integrations get data from cloud providers' APIs. Data is generally collected from monitoring APIs such as AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and GCP Stackdriver, and inventory metadata is collected from the specific services' APIs. You can use the account status dashboard to see how your cloud integrations are handling data from a cloud service provider. If you want to report more or less data from your cloud integrations, or if you need to control the use of the cloud providers' APIs to prevent reaching rate and throttling limits in your cloud account, you can change the configuration settings to modify the amount of data they report. The two main controls are: Change polling frequency Change what data is reported Examples of business reasons for wanting to change your polling frequency include: Billing: If you need to manage your AWS CloudWatch bill, you may want to decrease the polling frequency. Before you do this, make sure that any alert conditions set for your cloud integrations are not affected by this reduction. New services: If you are deploying a new service or configuration and you want to collect data more often, you may want to increase the polling frequency temporarily. Caution Changing the configuration settings for your integrations may impact alert conditions and chart trends. Change polling frequency The polling frequency configuration determines how often New Relic reports data from your cloud provider for each service. By default, the polling frequency is set to the maximum frequency that is available for each service. To change the polling frequency for a cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Use the dropdowns next to Data polling interval every to select how frequently you want New Relic to capture your cloud integration data. Specify data to be fetched You can specify which information you want captured for your cloud integration by enabling the collection of additional data and by applying multiple filters to each integration. To change this settings for your cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Under Data collections and filters, turn the toggles you want On. For filters, select or enter the values that you want included in your reported data. Data collection For some cloud integrations, an additional number of calls to the cloud provider APIs are needed in order to collect data. For example, to fetch tags for AWS Elastic Map Reduce clusters, an additional call to the service API is required. To better control the amount of API calls that are sent to your cloud account for these integrations, you can specify when you need these types of data to be collected. Different data collection toggles are available, depending on the integration. Toggle Description Collect tags Some integrations require additional API calls to the cloud provider to report tags. Tag collection is enabled by default. Switch this to Off if you don't want the integration to collect your cloud resource tags and thus reduce the volume of API calls. Collect extended inventory Some integrations can collect extended inventory metadata about your cloud resources by making additional API calls to the cloud provider. The metadata included within the extended inventory for each cloud integration is described in the integration documentation. Extended inventory collection is disabled by default. Switch this to On if you want to monitor extended inventory. This will increase the volume of API calls. Collect shards data Available for AWS Kinesis Streams integration. By default, we don't report shard metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor shard metrics in addition to data stream metrics. Collect Lambda@Edge data Available for AWS CloudFront integration. By default, we don't report Lambda@Edge data. Switch this to On if you're using Lambda@Edge in AWS CloudFront and want to get Lambda execution location metadata. Collect node data Available for AWS Elasticsearch integration. By default, we don't report Elasticsearch node metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor node metrics in addition to cluster metrics. Collect NAT Gateway data and Collect VPN data Available for AWS VPC integration. By default, we don't report NAT Gateway nor VPN metrics. Switch these to On if you want to monitor NAT Gateway and VPN metrics and inventory, in addition to other VPC related entities inventory. Collect IP addresses Available for AWS EC2 integration. By default, we collect EC2 instance metadata that includes public and private IP addresses, and network interface details. Switch this to Off if you don't want New Relic to store and display these IP data. Filters When a filter is On, you specify the data that you want to be collected; for example, if the Limit to AWS region is On, the regions that you select will be the ones that data will be collected for. There are different filters available, depending on the integration: Filter Description Region Select the regions that include the resources that you want to monitor. Queue prefixes Available for AWS SQS integration. Enter each name or prefix for the queues that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Load balancer prefixes Available for AWS ALB integration. Enter each name or prefix for the application load balancers that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Stage name prefixes Available for AWS API Gateway integration. Enter each name or prefix for the stages that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Tag key Enter one tag key that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag value filter. Tag value Enter one tag value that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag key. Resource group Select the resource groups that are associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Potential impact on alerts and charts If you change an integration's configuration, it can impact alert conditions and charts. Here are some things to consider: If you change this setting... It may have this impact... Any configuration setting When you change the configuration settings, the data that New Relic displays in infrastructure charts, on the inventory page, and in the events feed changes as well. Any filters When you create alert conditions after you set filters, make sure that your alerts are not triggered by resources that you filtered out. Filter for regions If you filter for specific regions, it may lower the amount of data reported to New Relic, which could trigger an alert. If you create an alert condition for a specific region and then filter that region out, the region would no longer report data and would never trigger the alert. Polling frequency When you create an alert, make sure that you define the threshold for a time period that is longer than the polling frequency. Tags and extended inventory If you turn on tags and/or extended inventory, New Relic makes more API calls to the cloud provider, which could increase your cloud provider API usage bill.",

Cloud integrations Cloud integrations collect data from cloud services and accounts. There's no installation process for cloud integrations, you simply connect your New Relic account to your cloud provider account. Integrations Description Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-based integrations Connect your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of AWS integrations. Microsoft Azure cloud-based integrations Connect your Microsoft Azure account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of Azure integrations. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cloud-based integrations Connect your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of GCP integrations. On-host integrations On-host integrations are what we call integrations that you can run directly on your host or server. They typically connect to core services in your servers: Integrations Description Kubernetes integration Connect your account to gain visibility of your Kubernetes environment, explore your clusters, and manage alerts. On-host integrations Monitor and report data from many popular services, including Kubernetes, Redis, Apache, RabbitMQ, and many more. Build your own To create your own lightweight integration, use our Flex integration tool. Install instructions To enable cloud integrations or install on-host integrations, see: Cloud integrations: AWS procedures, Azure procedures, Google Cloud Platform procedures Kubernetes: Kubernetes procedures On-host integrations: See an integration's documentation for install procedures SDK integrations: Procedures to create a custom integration Features After an infrastructure integration is activated, you can: Filter and analyze the metrics and configuration data in our Infrastructure UI. Query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Create alert conditions to monitor problems with your services' performance. For cloud integrations, configure data collection settings. Types of integration data Infrastructure integrations generate some basic types of data that you can use in New Relic. Integration data Description Metrics Numeric measurement data. Examples: Number of requests in a queue Number of hits on a database per minute Percentage of CPU being used Cloud-based and on-host integrations include pre-built dashboards that display important metrics. Inventory Live system state and configuration information. Examples: Host name AWS region or availability zone Port being used Changes in inventory generate events in New Relic, so you can easily figure out when performance issues were caused by a change in the system. Events Important activity on a system. Examples: Service starting Version update New table being created Changes to inventory are a type of event. Attributes Key-value pairs generated by some integrations. Examples: Certain inventory data Additional data attached to events Any data that is not considered metrics or inventory Depending on the integration, other types of information may be reported as attributes. Our integrations are data agnostic; they have no knowledge of whether reported data contains personal information.

      "body": "Our cloud integrations get data from cloud provider APIs. In New Relic, you can change some of the data collection-related settings for your cloud integrations. Read on to see what changes you can make and the reasons for making them. Tip To use integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Overview of settings New Relic cloud integrations get data from cloud providers' APIs. Data is generally collected from monitoring APIs such as AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and GCP Stackdriver, and inventory metadata is collected from the specific services' APIs. You can use the account status dashboard to see how your cloud integrations are handling data from a cloud service provider. If you want to report more or less data from your cloud integrations, or if you need to control the use of the cloud providers' APIs to prevent reaching rate and throttling limits in your cloud account, you can change the configuration settings to modify the amount of data they report. The two main controls are: Change polling frequency Change what data is reported Examples of business reasons for wanting to change your polling frequency include: Billing: If you need to manage your AWS CloudWatch bill, you may want to decrease the polling frequency. Before you do this, make sure that any alert conditions set for your cloud integrations are not affected by this reduction. New services: If you are deploying a new service or configuration and you want to collect data more often, you may want to increase the polling frequency temporarily. Caution Changing the configuration settings for your integrations may impact alert conditions and chart trends. Change polling frequency The polling frequency configuration determines how often New Relic reports data from your cloud provider for each service. By default, the polling frequency is set to the maximum frequency that is available for each service. To change the polling frequency for a cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Use the dropdowns next to Data polling interval every to select how frequently you want New Relic to capture your cloud integration data. Specify data to be fetched You can specify which information you want captured for your cloud integration by enabling the collection of additional data and by applying multiple filters to each integration. To change this settings for your cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Under Data collections and filters, turn the toggles you want On. For filters, select or enter the values that you want included in your reported data. Data collection For some cloud integrations, an additional number of calls to the cloud provider APIs are needed in order to collect data. For example, to fetch tags for AWS Elastic Map Reduce clusters, an additional call to the service API is required. To better control the amount of API calls that are sent to your cloud account for these integrations, you can specify when you need these types of data to be collected. Different data collection toggles are available, depending on the integration. Toggle Description Collect tags Some integrations require additional API calls to the cloud provider to report tags. Tag collection is enabled by default. Switch this to Off if you don't want the integration to collect your cloud resource tags and thus reduce the volume of API calls. Collect extended inventory Some integrations can collect extended inventory metadata about your cloud resources by making additional API calls to the cloud provider. The metadata included within the extended inventory for each cloud integration is described in the integration documentation. Extended inventory collection is disabled by default. Switch this to On if you want to monitor extended inventory. This will increase the volume of API calls. Collect shards data Available for AWS Kinesis Streams integration. By default, we don't report shard metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor shard metrics in addition to data stream metrics. Collect Lambda@Edge data Available for AWS CloudFront integration. By default, we don't report Lambda@Edge data. Switch this to On if you're using Lambda@Edge in AWS CloudFront and want to get Lambda execution location metadata. Collect node data Available for AWS Elasticsearch integration. By default, we don't report Elasticsearch node metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor node metrics in addition to cluster metrics. Collect NAT Gateway data and Collect VPN data Available for AWS VPC integration. By default, we don't report NAT Gateway nor VPN metrics. Switch these to On if you want to monitor NAT Gateway and VPN metrics and inventory, in addition to other VPC related entities inventory. Collect IP addresses Available for AWS EC2 integration. By default, we collect EC2 instance metadata that includes public and private IP addresses, and network interface details. Switch this to Off if you don't want New Relic to store and display these IP data. Filters When a filter is On, you specify the data that you want to be collected; for example, if the Limit to AWS region is On, the regions that you select will be the ones that data will be collected for. There are different filters available, depending on the integration: Filter Description Region Select the regions that include the resources that you want to monitor. Queue prefixes Available for AWS SQS integration. Enter each name or prefix for the queues that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Load balancer prefixes Available for AWS ALB integration. Enter each name or prefix for the application load balancers that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Stage name prefixes Available for AWS API Gateway integration. Enter each name or prefix for the stages that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Tag key Enter one tag key that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag value filter. Tag value Enter one tag value that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag key. Resource group Select the resource groups that are associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Potential impact on alerts and charts If you change an integration's configuration, it can impact alert conditions and charts. Here are some things to consider: If you change this setting... It may have this impact... Any configuration setting When you change the configuration settings, the data that New Relic displays in infrastructure charts, on the inventory page, and in the events feed changes as well. Any filters When you create alert conditions after you set filters, make sure that your alerts are not triggered by resources that you filtered out. Filter for regions If you filter for specific regions, it may lower the amount of data reported to New Relic, which could trigger an alert. If you create an alert condition for a specific region and then filter that region out, the region would no longer report data and would never trigger the alert. Polling frequency When you create an alert, make sure that you define the threshold for a time period that is longer than the polling frequency. Tags and extended inventory If you turn on tags and/or extended inventory, New Relic makes more API calls to the cloud provider, which could increase your cloud provider API usage bill.",

Tips for using different data types Integrations can generate metric, event, and inventory data, all of which are available for querying in New Relic Insights. Here are some tips for using the different types of integration data in Insights: Metric data tips Tips for finding and using integration metric data in Insights: All integration data is attached to a data type known as an event (not to be confused with events reported by integrations, which represent important activity in your host/service). This means that all integration data can be found via the data explorer. For more about these two basic New Relic data types, see New Relic data collection. Metric values are treated as attributes: key-value pairs attached to an event. For example, the MySQL integration has an 'active connections' metric; this would be found by querying the connectionsActive attribute of the MysqlSample event. For general information about metrics, see Integration metric data. Event data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration event data in Insights: Most integration events are inventory change events. When inventory is changed, it generates an InfrastructureEvent with a format value of inventoryChange. Integration data can be found via the data explorer. For general information about events, see Event data. Inventory data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration inventory data in Insights: For general information about inventory data, see Integration inventory data. Some inventory data is added as attributes (key-value pairs) to Insights data. For example, the AWS EC2 integration collects awsRegion as inventory data; this would be found in Insights by querying the awsRegion attribute of the ComputeSample event type and provider Ec2Instance. When inventory data changes, an Insights InfrastructureEvent event type is generated with a format value of inventoryChange. See the query examples for an example of querying this data.

The Microsoft Azure integrations report data from various Azure platform services to your New Relic account. This document explains how to activate Azure integrations. Tip To use Azure integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements The Azure integration activation process requires you to: Create a New Relic application and key in Azure. Grant this application access to the Azure services you want to monitor. Place required information in the New Relic's Integrations UI. To use these integration activation instructions directly from the Infrastructure UI, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > Add an Azure account. Step 1: Get Azure subscription and tenant IDs To get your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId, use your local terminal if you have Azure's tools installed, or use Azure's Cloud Shell terminal in the Azure portal. Open a terminal with access to your Azure account. Type the following: az account show Copy Copy and save the subscription id and tenantID from the output response for later use. The response should look similar to the response below. The subscription id and tenantID are highlighted. @Azure:~$ az account show { \"environmentName\": \"AzureCloud\", \"id\": \"9ffe9512-f4a2-42dd-1230-518aec34be21\" , \"isDefault\": true, \"name\": \"Beyond Team Sandbox\", \"state\": \"Enabled\", \"tenantId\": \"ac6692da-1231-422f-22a8-9eed6dbe83f1\" , \"user\": { \"name\": \"youremail@domain\", \"type\": \"user\" } Copy Step 2: Register your app and get ID You must have Azure permissions to register your application and copy its Application ID. To register your app in Azure: Sign in to the Azure portal and go to the Azure Active Directory. From Manage, select App registrations > New registration. Enter a name for the application. We recommend that you name your app NewRelic-Integrations. In Redirect URI select Weband add https://www.newrelic.com as the sign-on URI. Create the application by clicking Register. From the Overview of your app, copy the Application (client) ID, and save it for later use. Step 3: Create a client secret in Azure To create a client secret associated with your application: In Azure, under the application you've just created, select Certificates & secrets. Under Client secrets, click on New client secret and then on Add. Copy the value of Client Secret and save it for later use. Step 4: Provide permissions to services Your app must provide Reader permissions for each Azure service you want New Relic to monitor: In the Azure Subscriptions section, select the subscriptions that you want New Relic to monitor. Select Access control (IAM) > Add > Add role assignment. From the Role dropdown, select Reader. From the Select dropdown, select the app's name; for example, NewRelic-Integrations. From Selected members, verify your app name appears, then select Save. Some Azure services, including Azure CosmosDB and Azure VMs, require additional steps. See the Azure integration documentation for the services you want to enable. Step 5: Add app to New Relic Now you can activate the Azure integration in the Infrastructure UI. The UI will require the information you have saved in the previous steps, including: Your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId The application's application ID The application's client secret To add your Azure app to New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and select the Azure Service you wish to add. Follow the steps in the UI to activate the integration in New Relic. If you have already completed the Azure account steps, skip to the end of the steps to fill out the form. (For Azure account name, enter the name you want to use to identify the account in your Integrations dashboard.) Update application details and rotate client secrets It's possible to update the application's name and authentication credentials using the Infrastructure UI or the Cloud Integrations API at any time. Follow these steps to rotate the Azure client secret in the Infratructure UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and click on Manage Services on the Azure account you wish to edit. Select the edit action next to Account Name to see and edit any application value. Edit the Client Secret field with the new value and confirm with Save Changes. Explore app data in New Relic Infrastructure's UI After you activate an Azure integration, New Relic will start monitoring your Azure data at regular polling intervals.

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more new relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API.

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more new relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API.

      "body": "Most data generated by integrations is available in New Relic One dashboards, where you can query your data using NRQL and build custom dashboards. The following tips and sample queries were created for New Relic-built integrations, but most will also apply to integrations built with the Integrations SDK. For a general look at how to find and use integration data, see New Relic data types. Get started with integration data Here are some tips for finding and exploring your integration data in New Relic: From the one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services page, select an integration dashboard. There, you can view the NRQL queries that generated a chart. For examples of NRQL queries for integration data, see the example queries. Use the data explorer or the dashboards to explore and understand the available data. Read the documentation for a specific integration to learn about the reported data. When you create a useful query you'd like to add to your Insights dashboard, select Add to dashboard. Example NRQL queries Here are some examples of NRQL queries that use integration data: AWS EBS query example Here's a NRQL query for the AWS EBS service, showing the total write time metric, faceted by entityName: SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') FROM BlockDeviceSample WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Azure Service Bus query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for the maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic queue, faceted by resource group: SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample FACET resourceGroupName Copy Azure Functions query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for Azure Functions, showing the count of executed functions over the past six hours by region over time: SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for Azure VMs that compares the count of VM events over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago: SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample FACET name SINCE 30 minutes ago COMPARE WITH 1 week ago Copy NGINX query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your NGINX integration data and place in an Insights dashboard. This query creates a chart showing the average value of NGINX requests per second over time: SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) FROM NginxSample TIMESERIES Copy For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. MySQL query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your MySQL integration data. This query generates a chart showing the maximum number of used MySQL connections: SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) FROM MysqlSample Copy For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. Inventory change query example Here's an example of a query that groups inventory change events from the last day by the type of change: SELECT count(*) FROM InfrastructureEvent WHERE format='inventoryChange' FACET changeType SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy Tip You can also perform these queries using dimensional metrics. Tips for using different data types Integrations can generate metric, event, and inventory data, all of which are available for querying in New Relic Insights. Here are some tips for using the different types of integration data in Insights: Metric data tips Tips for finding and using integration metric data in Insights: All integration data is attached to a data type known as an event (not to be confused with events reported by integrations, which represent important activity in your host/service). This means that all integration data can be found via the data explorer. For more about these two basic New Relic data types, see New Relic data collection. Metric values are treated as attributes: key-value pairs attached to an event. For example, the MySQL integration has an 'active connections' metric; this would be found by querying the connectionsActive attribute of the MysqlSample event. For general information about metrics, see Integration metric data. Event data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration event data in Insights: Most integration events are inventory change events. When inventory is changed, it generates an InfrastructureEvent with a format value of inventoryChange. Integration data can be found via the data explorer. For general information about events, see Event data. Inventory data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration inventory data in Insights: For general information about inventory data, see Integration inventory data. Some inventory data is added as attributes (key-value pairs) to Insights data. For example, the AWS EC2 integration collects awsRegion as inventory data; this would be found in Insights by querying the awsRegion attribute of the ComputeSample event type and provider Ec2Instance. When inventory data changes, an Insights InfrastructureEvent event type is generated with a format value of inventoryChange. See the query examples for an example of querying this data. For more on using NRQL queries, see Intro to NRQL.",

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more new relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license.

The Microsoft Azure integrations report data from various Azure platform services to your New Relic account. This document explains how to activate Azure integrations. Tip To use Azure integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements The Azure integration activation process requires you to: Create a New Relic application and key in Azure. Grant this application access to the Azure services you want to monitor. Place required information in the New Relic's Integrations UI. To use these integration activation instructions directly from the Infrastructure UI, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > Add an Azure account. Step 1: Get Azure subscription and tenant IDs To get your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId, use your local terminal if you have Azure's tools installed, or use Azure's Cloud Shell terminal in the Azure portal. Open a terminal with access to your Azure account. Type the following: az account show Copy Copy and save the subscription id and tenantID from the output response for later use. The response should look similar to the response below. The subscription id and tenantID are highlighted. @Azure:~$ az account show { \"environmentName\": \"AzureCloud\", \"id\": \"9ffe9512-f4a2-42dd-1230-518aec34be21\" , \"isDefault\": true, \"name\": \"Beyond Team Sandbox\", \"state\": \"Enabled\", \"tenantId\": \"ac6692da-1231-422f-22a8-9eed6dbe83f1\" , \"user\": { \"name\": \"youremail@domain\", \"type\": \"user\" } Copy Step 2: Register your app and get ID You must have Azure permissions to register your application and copy its Application ID. To register your app in Azure: Sign in to the Azure portal and go to the Azure Active Directory. From Manage, select App registrations > New registration. Enter a name for the application. We recommend that you name your app NewRelic-Integrations. In Redirect URI select Weband add https://www.newrelic.com as the sign-on URI. Create the application by clicking Register. From the Overview of your app, copy the Application (client) ID, and save it for later use. Step 3: Create a client secret in Azure To create a client secret associated with your application: In Azure, under the application you've just created, select Certificates & secrets. Under Client secrets, click on New client secret and then on Add. Copy the value of Client Secret and save it for later use. Step 4: Provide permissions to services Your app must provide Reader permissions for each Azure service you want New Relic to monitor: In the Azure Subscriptions section, select the subscriptions that you want New Relic to monitor. Select Access control (IAM) > Add > Add role assignment. From the Role dropdown, select Reader. From the Select dropdown, select the app's name; for example, NewRelic-Integrations. From Selected members, verify your app name appears, then select Save. Some Azure services, including Azure CosmosDB and Azure VMs, require additional steps. See the Azure integration documentation for the services you want to enable. Step 5: Add app to New Relic Now you can activate the Azure integration in the Infrastructure UI. The UI will require the information you have saved in the previous steps, including: Your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId The application's application ID The application's client secret To add your Azure app to New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and select the Azure Service you wish to add. Follow the steps in the UI to activate the integration in New Relic. If you have already completed the Azure account steps, skip to the end of the steps to fill out the form. (For Azure account name, enter the name you want to use to identify the account in your Integrations dashboard.) Update application details and rotate client secrets It's possible to update the application's name and authentication credentials using the Infrastructure UI or the Cloud Integrations API at any time. Follow these steps to rotate the Azure client secret in the Infratructure UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and click on Manage Services on the Azure account you wish to edit. Select the edit action next to Account Name to see and edit any application value. Edit the Client Secret field with the new value and confirm with Save Changes. Explore app data in New Relic Infrastructure's UI After you activate an Azure integration, New Relic will start monitoring your Azure data at regular polling intervals.

Cloud integrations Cloud integrations collect data from cloud services and accounts. There's no installation process for cloud integrations, you simply connect your New Relic account to your cloud provider account. Integrations Description Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-based integrations Connect your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of AWS integrations. Microsoft Azure cloud-based integrations Connect your Microsoft Azure account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of Azure integrations. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cloud-based integrations Connect your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of GCP integrations. On-host integrations On-host integrations are what we call integrations that you can run directly on your host or server. They typically connect to core services in your servers: Integrations Description Kubernetes integration Connect your account to gain visibility of your Kubernetes environment, explore your clusters, and manage alerts. On-host integrations Monitor and report data from many popular services, including Kubernetes, Redis, Apache, RabbitMQ, and many more. Build your own To create your own lightweight integration, use our Flex integration tool. Install instructions To enable cloud integrations or install on-host integrations, see: Cloud integrations: AWS procedures, Azure procedures, Google Cloud Platform procedures Kubernetes: Kubernetes procedures On-host integrations: See an integration's documentation for install procedures SDK integrations: Procedures to create a custom integration Features After an infrastructure integration is activated, you can: Filter and analyze the metrics and configuration data in our Infrastructure UI. Query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Create alert conditions to monitor problems with your services' performance. For cloud integrations, configure data collection settings. Types of integration data Infrastructure integrations generate some basic types of data that you can use in New Relic. Integration data Description Metrics Numeric measurement data. Examples: Number of requests in a queue Number of hits on a database per minute Percentage of CPU being used Cloud-based and on-host integrations include pre-built dashboards that display important metrics. Inventory Live system state and configuration information. Examples: Host name AWS region or availability zone Port being used Changes in inventory generate events in New Relic, so you can easily figure out when performance issues were caused by a change in the system. Events Important activity on a system. Examples: Service starting Version update New table being created Changes to inventory are a type of event. Attributes Key-value pairs generated by some integrations. Examples: Certain inventory data Additional data attached to events Any data that is not considered metrics or inventory Depending on the integration, other types of information may be reported as attributes. Our integrations are data agnostic; they have no knowledge of whether reported data contains personal information.

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more new relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API.

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more new relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API.

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority.

For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

Tip To use ECS integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Install overview Before you install our ECS integration, we recommend reviewing the requirements. Here's a brief overview of what happens during the install process: For EC2 launch type: The infrastructure agent (newrelic-infra) gets deployed onto an ECS cluster as a service using the daemon scheduling strategy. This deployment installs the infrastructure agent in all the container instances of the cluster. The infrastructure agent then monitors ECS and Docker containers. For Fargate launch type: The infrastructure agent (newrelic-infra) gets deployed as a sidecar in every task to monitor. Install options: Install using AWS CloudFormation Install using automatic script Install manually Install using CloudFormation One install option is using AWS CloudFormation. We provide some CloudFormation templates that install the ECS integration onto your AWS account for both EC2 and Fargate launch types: To register the New Relic's ECS integration task, deploy this stack. Ensure you’re deploying the stack to your desired region(s). This stack creates the following resources: A secret that stores the license key. A policy to access the license key. An instance role to be used as an ECS task ExecutionRole, with access to the license key. For EC2 launch type: Registers the New Relic Infrastructure ECS integration task. Follow the additional instructions for your launch type: EC2 launch type Additional steps for EC2 launch type: To create a service that runs the task on every container instance, deploy this stack. Fargate launch type Additional steps for Fargate launch type: Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the newrelic-infra container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want to monitor. In this example task, your application's containers replace the placeholder busybox container. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, which gets you other ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. Install with automatic script One install option is using our install script. To use the automatic install script: Download the ECS integration installer: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh Copy Add execute permissions to the installer: chmod +x newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh Copy Execute it with -h to see the documentation and requirements: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -h Copy Check that your AWS profile points to the same region where your ECS cluster was created: $ aws configure get region us-east-1 $ aws ecs list-clusters YOUR_CLUSTER_ARNS arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:cluster/YOUR_CLUSTER Copy Execute the installer, specifying your license key and cluster name. EC2 launch type: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Fargate launch type: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -fargate -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Additional steps for Fargate launch type (not EC2 launch type): Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the single container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want monitored. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, which gets you other ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. Manual install One install option is to manually do the steps that are done by the automatic installer script. We will describe how this is done using the awscli tool: Check that your AWS profile points to the same region where your ECS cluster was created: $ aws configure get region us-east-1 $ aws ecs list-clusters YOUR_CLUSTER_ARNS arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:cluster/YOUR_CLUSTER Copy Save your New Relic license key as a Systems Manager (SSM) parameter: aws ssm put-parameter \\ --name \"/newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key\" \\ --type SecureString \\ --description 'New Relic license key for ECS monitoring' \\ --value \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Create an IAM policy to access the license key parameter: aws iam create-policy \\ --policy-name \"NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess\" \\ --policy-document \"{\"Version\"\\\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":[\"ssm:GetParameters\"],\"Resource\":[\"ARN_OF_LICENSE_KEY_PARAMETER\"]}]}\" --description \"Provides read access to the New Relic SSM license key parameter\" Copy Create an IAM role to be used as the task execution role: aws iam create-role \\ --role-name \"NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole\" \\ --assume-role-policy-document '{\"Version\":\"2008-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"Service\":\"ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com\"},\"Action\":\"sts:AssumeRole\"}]}' \\ --description \"ECS task execution role for New Relic infrastructure\" Copy Attach the policies NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess, AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role, and AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy to the role: aws iam attach-role-policy \\ --role-name \"NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole\" \\ --policy-arn \"POLICY_ARN\" Copy Choose your launch type for more instructions: EC2 launch type Additional steps for EC2 launch type: Download the New Relic ECS integration task definition template file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-ec2-latest.json Copy Replace the task execution role in the template file with the newly created role: \"executionRoleArn\": \"NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole\", Copy Replace the valueFrom attribute of the secret with the name of the Systems Manager parameter: secrets\": [ { \"valueFrom\": \"/newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key\", \"name\": \"NRIA_LICENSE_KEY\" } ], Copy Register the task definition file: aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://newrelic-infra-ecs-ec2-latest.json Copy Create a service with the daemon scheduling strategy for the registered task: aws ecs create-service --cluster \"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" --service-name \"newrelic-infra\" --task-definition \"newrelic-infra\" --scheduling-strategy DAEMON Copy Fargate launch type Additional steps for the Fargate launch type: Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the newrelic-infra container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want to monitor.

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "You can surface Kubernetes metadata and link it to your APM agents as distributed traces to explore performance issues and troubleshoot transaction errors. For more information, see this New Relic blog post. You can quickly start monitoring Kubernetes clusters using Auto-telemetry with Pixie, which is currently a beta release. This Pixie integration into New Relic does not require a language agent. Learn more about Auto-telemetry with Pixie here. Tip Our Kubernetes metadata injection project is open source. Here's the code to link APM and infrastructure data and the code to automatically manage certificates. Compatibility and requirements Before linking Kubernetes metadata to your APM agents, make sure you meet the following requirements: Kubernetes requirements Network requirements APM agent compatibility OpenShift requirements Kubernetes requirements To link your applications and Kubernetes, your cluster must have the MutatingAdmissionWebhook controller enabled, which requires Kubernetes 1.9 or higher. To verify that your cluster is compatible, run the following command: kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 Copy If you see a different result, follow the Kubernetes documentation to enable admission control in your cluster. Network requirements For Kubernetes to speak to our MutatingAdmissionWebhook, the master node (or the API server container, depending on how the cluster is set up) should be allowed egress for HTTPS traffic on port 443 to pods in all of the other nodes in the cluster. This might require specific configuration depending on how the infrastructure is set up (on-premises, AWS, Google Cloud, etc). Tip Until Kubernetes v1.14, users were only allowed to register admission webhooks on port 443. Since v1.15 it's possible to register them on different ports. To ensure backward compatibility, the webhook is registered by default on port 443 in the YAML config file we distribute. APM agent compatibility The following New Relic agents collect Kubernetes metadata: Go 2.3.0 or higher Java 4.10.0 or higher Node.js 5.3.0 or higher Python 4.14.0 or higher Ruby 6.1.0 or higher .NET 8.17.438 or higher Openshift requirements To link Openshift and Kubernetes you must enable mutating admission webhooks, which requires Openshift 3.9 or higher. During the process, install a resource that requires admin permissions to the cluster. Run this to log in as admin: oc login -u system:admin Copy Check that webhooks are correctly configured. If they are not, update the master-config.yaml file. admissionConfig: pluginConfig: MutatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission ValidatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission location: \"\" Copy Important Add kubeConfigFile: /dev/null to address some issues in Openshift. Enable certificate signing by editing the YAML file and updating your configuration: kubernetesMasterConfig: controllerArguments: cluster-signing-cert-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.crt\" cluster-signing-key-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.key\" Copy Restart the Openshift services in the master node. Configure the injection of metadata By default, all the pods you create that include APM agents have the correct environment variables set and the metadata injection applies to the entire cluster. To check that the environment variables have been set, any container that is running must be stopped, and a new instance started (see Validate the injection of metadata). This default configuration also uses the Kubernetes certificates API to automatically manage the certificates required for the injection. If needed, you can limit the injection of metadata to specific namespaces in your cluster or self-manage your certificates. Default configuration To proceed with the default injection of metadata, follow these steps: Download the YAML file: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Custom configuration You can limit the injection of metadata only to specific namespaces by using labels. To enable this feature, edit your YAML file by finding and uncommenting the following lines: # namespaceSelector: # matchLabels: # newrelic-metadata-injection: enabled Copy With this option, injection is only applied to those namespaces that have the newrelic-metadata-injection label set to enabled: kubectl label namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE newrelic-metadata-injection=enabled Copy Manage custom certificates To use custom certificates you need a specific YAML file: Download the YAML file without automatic certificate management: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Once you have the correct YAML file, you can proceed with the custom certificate management option. You need your certificate, server key, and Certification Authority (CA) bundle encoded in PEM format. If you have them in the standard certificate format (X.509), install openssl, and run the following: openssl x509 -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out CERTIFICATE_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in SERVER_KEY_FILENAME -outform PEM -out SERVER_KEY_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in CA_BUNDLE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out BUNDLE_FILENAME.pem Copy If your certificate/key pair are in another format, see the Digicert knowledgebase for more help. Create the TLS secret with the signed certificate/key pair, and patch the mutating webhook configuration with the CA using the following commands: kubectl create secret tls newrelic-metadata-injection-secret \\ --key=PEM_ENCODED_SERVER_KEY \\ --cert=PEM_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE \\ --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl -n default apply -f - caBundle=$(cat PEM_ENCODED_CA_BUNDLE | base64 | td -d '\\n') kubectl patch mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg --type='json' -p \"[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle', 'value':'${caBundle}'}]\" Copy Important Certificates signed by Kubernetes have an expiration of one year. For more information, see the Kubernetes source code in GitHub. Validate the injection of metadata In order to validate that the webhook (responsible for injecting the metadata) was installed correctly, deploy a new pod and check for the New Relic environment variables. Create a dummy pod containing Busybox by running: kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Check if New Relic environment variables were injected: kubectl exec busybox0 -- env | grep NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME=fsi NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME=nodea NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME=default NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME=busybox0 NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME=busybox Copy Disable the injection of metadata To disable/uninstall the injection of metadata, use the following commands: Delete the Kubernetes objects using the yaml file: kubectl delete -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Delete the TLS secret containing the certificate/key pair: kubectl delete secret/newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Troubleshooting Follow these troubleshooting tips as needed. No Kubernetes metadata in APM or distributed tracing transactions Problem The creation of the secret by the k8s-webhook-cert-manager job used to fail due to the kubectl version used by the image when running in Kubernetes version 1.19.x, The new version 1.3.2 fixes this issue, therefore it is enough to run again the job using an update version of the image to fix the issue. Solution Update the image k8s-webhook-cert-manager (to a version >= 1.3.2) and re-run the job. The secret will be correctly created and the k8s-metadata-injection pod will be able to start. Note that the new version of the manifest and of the nri-bundle are already updated with the correct version of the image. Problem In OpenShift version 4.x, the CA that is used in order to patch the mutatingwebhookconfiguration resource is not the one used when signing the certificates. This is a known issue currently tracked here. In the logs of the Pod nri-metadata-injection, you'll see the following error message: TLS handshake error from 10.131.0.29:37428: remote error: tls: unknown certificate authority TLS handshake error from 10.129.0.1:49314: remote error: tls: bad certificate Copy Workaround Manually update the certificate stored in the mutatingwebhookconfiguration object. The correct CA locations might change according to the cluster configuration. However, you can usually find the CA in the secret csr-signer in the namespace openshift-kube-controller-manager. Problem There is no Kubernetes metadata included in the transactions' attributes of your APM agent or in distributed tracing. Solution Verify that the environment variables are being correctly injected by following the instructions described in the Validate your installation step. If they are not present, get the name of the metadata injection pod by running: kubectl get pods | grep newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment kubectl logs -f pod/podname Copy In another terminal, create a new pod (for example, see Validate your installation), and inspect the logs of the metadata injection deployment for errors. For every created pod there should be a set of 4 new entries in the logs like: {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.107Z\",\"caller\":\"server/main.go:139\",\"msg\":\"POST https://newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default.svc:443/mutate?timeout=30s HTTP/2.0\\\" from 10.11.49.2:32836\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.110Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:168\",\"msg\":\"received admission review\",\"kind\":\"/v1, Kind=Pod\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"name\":\"\",\"pod\":\"busybox1\",\"UID\":\"6577519b-7a61-11ea-965e-0e46d1c9335c\",\"operation\":\"CREATE\",\"userinfo\":{\"username\":\"admin\",\"uid\":\"admin\",\"groups\":[\"system:masters\",\"system:authenticated\"]}} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:182\",\"msg\":\"admission response created\",\"response\":\"[{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env\\\",\\\"value\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"adn_kops\\\"}]},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"spec.nodeName\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.namespace\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.name\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}}]\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:257\",\"msg\":\"writing response\"} Copy If there are no new entries on the logs, it means that the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook service, this could be due to networking rules or security groups rejecting the communication. To check if the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook you should inspect the apiserver logs for errors like: failed calling webhook \"metadata-injection.newrelic.com\": ERROR_REASON Copy To get the apiserver logs: Start a proxy to the Kubernetes API server by the executing the following command in a terminal window and keep it running. kubectl proxy --port=8001 Copy Create a new pod in your cluster, this will make the apiserver try to communicate with the webhook. The following command will create a busybox. kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Retrieve the apiserver logs. curl localhost:8001/logs/kube-apiserver.log > apiserver.log Copy Delete the busybox container. kubectl delete -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Inspect the logs for errors. grep -E 'failed calling webhook' apiserver.log Copy Remember that one of the requirements for the metadata injection is that the apiserver must be allowed egress to the pods running on the cluster. If you encounter errors regarding connection timeouts or failed connections, make sure to check the security groups and firewall rules of the cluster. If there are no log entries in either the apiserver logs or the metadata injection deployment, it means that the webhook was not properly registered. Ensure the metadata injection setup job ran successfully by inspecting the output of: kubectl get job newrelic-metadata-setup Copy If the job is not completed, investigate the logs of the setup job: kubectl logs job/newrelic-metadata-setup Copy Ensure the CertificateSigningRequest is approved and issued by running: kubectl get csr newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default Copy Ensure the TLS secret is present by running: kubectl get secret newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Ensure the CA bundle is present in the mutating webhook configuration: kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg -o json Copy Ensure the TargetPort of the Service resource matches the Port of the Deployment's container: kubectl describe service/newrelic-metadata-injection-svc kubectl describe deployment/newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment Copy",

      "body": "If you have a service running on Kubernetes, and it's a service we support, you can enable monitoring of that service by adding a configuration section for that integration to the Kubernetes integration's config. This tutorial shows how to enable monitoring for a Redis service running on the Kubernetes PHP Guestbook. For the general procedure, see Monitor a Kubernetes-running service. What you need See the general requirements for this feature, including supported services. The kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you don't have a cluster, you can create one using Minikube. Step 1: Set up an example Redis application This tutorial builds on the Kubernetes tutorial Deploying a PHP Guestbook application with Redis. Skip the Kubernetes tutorial and run the following command to set up the application needed for our tutorial: kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/examples/master/guestbook/all-in-one/guestbook-all-in-one.yaml Copy If you'd like to first complete the Kubernetes tutorial, follow their tutorial instructions but do not follow the instructions in the Cleaning up section. Step 2: Enable monitoring of Redis instances The PHP Guestbook application has three Redis instances: one master and two slave instances. Each instance is tagged with a label where app=redis. For this example, we're using our Redis monitoring integration. It can monitor both master and slave instances of Redis, so we don’t have to distinguish between them. In the Kubernetes integration's YAML config file (newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml), you need to update the nri-integration-cfg section. From the list of integration configs, get the Redis integration YAML and add it to the Kubernetes config. The Redis YAML is highlighted below. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: redis-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=redis\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Run discovery for Kubernetes.

Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "You can surface Kubernetes metadata and link it to your APM agents as distributed traces to explore performance issues and troubleshoot transaction errors. For more information, see this New Relic blog post. You can quickly start monitoring Kubernetes clusters using Auto-telemetry with Pixie, which is currently a beta release. This Pixie integration into New Relic does not require a language agent. Learn more about Auto-telemetry with Pixie here. Tip Our Kubernetes metadata injection project is open source. Here's the code to link APM and infrastructure data and the code to automatically manage certificates. Compatibility and requirements Before linking Kubernetes metadata to your APM agents, make sure you meet the following requirements: Kubernetes requirements Network requirements APM agent compatibility OpenShift requirements Kubernetes requirements To link your applications and Kubernetes, your cluster must have the MutatingAdmissionWebhook controller enabled, which requires Kubernetes 1.9 or higher. To verify that your cluster is compatible, run the following command: kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 Copy If you see a different result, follow the Kubernetes documentation to enable admission control in your cluster. Network requirements For Kubernetes to speak to our MutatingAdmissionWebhook, the master node (or the API server container, depending on how the cluster is set up) should be allowed egress for HTTPS traffic on port 443 to pods in all of the other nodes in the cluster. This might require specific configuration depending on how the infrastructure is set up (on-premises, AWS, Google Cloud, etc). Tip Until Kubernetes v1.14, users were only allowed to register admission webhooks on port 443. Since v1.15 it's possible to register them on different ports. To ensure backward compatibility, the webhook is registered by default on port 443 in the YAML config file we distribute. APM agent compatibility The following New Relic agents collect Kubernetes metadata: Go 2.3.0 or higher Java 4.10.0 or higher Node.js 5.3.0 or higher Python 4.14.0 or higher Ruby 6.1.0 or higher .NET 8.17.438 or higher Openshift requirements To link Openshift and Kubernetes you must enable mutating admission webhooks, which requires Openshift 3.9 or higher. During the process, install a resource that requires admin permissions to the cluster. Run this to log in as admin: oc login -u system:admin Copy Check that webhooks are correctly configured. If they are not, update the master-config.yaml file. admissionConfig: pluginConfig: MutatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission ValidatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission location: \"\" Copy Important Add kubeConfigFile: /dev/null to address some issues in Openshift. Enable certificate signing by editing the YAML file and updating your configuration: kubernetesMasterConfig: controllerArguments: cluster-signing-cert-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.crt\" cluster-signing-key-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.key\" Copy Restart the Openshift services in the master node. Configure the injection of metadata By default, all the pods you create that include APM agents have the correct environment variables set and the metadata injection applies to the entire cluster. To check that the environment variables have been set, any container that is running must be stopped, and a new instance started (see Validate the injection of metadata). This default configuration also uses the Kubernetes certificates API to automatically manage the certificates required for the injection. If needed, you can limit the injection of metadata to specific namespaces in your cluster or self-manage your certificates. Default configuration To proceed with the default injection of metadata, follow these steps: Download the YAML file: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Custom configuration You can limit the injection of metadata only to specific namespaces by using labels. To enable this feature, edit your YAML file by finding and uncommenting the following lines: # namespaceSelector: # matchLabels: # newrelic-metadata-injection: enabled Copy With this option, injection is only applied to those namespaces that have the newrelic-metadata-injection label set to enabled: kubectl label namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE newrelic-metadata-injection=enabled Copy Manage custom certificates To use custom certificates you need a specific YAML file: Download the YAML file without automatic certificate management: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Once you have the correct YAML file, you can proceed with the custom certificate management option. You need your certificate, server key, and Certification Authority (CA) bundle encoded in PEM format. If you have them in the standard certificate format (X.509), install openssl, and run the following: openssl x509 -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out CERTIFICATE_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in SERVER_KEY_FILENAME -outform PEM -out SERVER_KEY_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in CA_BUNDLE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out BUNDLE_FILENAME.pem Copy If your certificate/key pair are in another format, see the Digicert knowledgebase for more help. Create the TLS secret with the signed certificate/key pair, and patch the mutating webhook configuration with the CA using the following commands: kubectl create secret tls newrelic-metadata-injection-secret \\ --key=PEM_ENCODED_SERVER_KEY \\ --cert=PEM_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE \\ --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl -n default apply -f - caBundle=$(cat PEM_ENCODED_CA_BUNDLE | base64 | td -d '\\n') kubectl patch mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg --type='json' -p \"[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle', 'value':'${caBundle}'}]\" Copy Important Certificates signed by Kubernetes have an expiration of one year. For more information, see the Kubernetes source code in GitHub. Validate the injection of metadata In order to validate that the webhook (responsible for injecting the metadata) was installed correctly, deploy a new pod and check for the New Relic environment variables. Create a dummy pod containing Busybox by running: kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Check if New Relic environment variables were injected: kubectl exec busybox0 -- env | grep NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME=fsi NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME=nodea NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME=default NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME=busybox0 NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME=busybox Copy Disable the injection of metadata To disable/uninstall the injection of metadata, use the following commands: Delete the Kubernetes objects using the yaml file: kubectl delete -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Delete the TLS secret containing the certificate/key pair: kubectl delete secret/newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Troubleshooting Follow these troubleshooting tips as needed. No Kubernetes metadata in APM or distributed tracing transactions Problem The creation of the secret by the k8s-webhook-cert-manager job used to fail due to the kubectl version used by the image when running in Kubernetes version 1.19.x, The new version 1.3.2 fixes this issue, therefore it is enough to run again the job using an update version of the image to fix the issue. Solution Update the image k8s-webhook-cert-manager (to a version >= 1.3.2) and re-run the job. The secret will be correctly created and the k8s-metadata-injection pod will be able to start. Note that the new version of the manifest and of the nri-bundle are already updated with the correct version of the image. Problem In OpenShift version 4.x, the CA that is used in order to patch the mutatingwebhookconfiguration resource is not the one used when signing the certificates. This is a known issue currently tracked here. In the logs of the Pod nri-metadata-injection, you'll see the following error message: TLS handshake error from 10.131.0.29:37428: remote error: tls: unknown certificate authority TLS handshake error from 10.129.0.1:49314: remote error: tls: bad certificate Copy Workaround Manually update the certificate stored in the mutatingwebhookconfiguration object. The correct CA locations might change according to the cluster configuration. However, you can usually find the CA in the secret csr-signer in the namespace openshift-kube-controller-manager. Problem There is no Kubernetes metadata included in the transactions' attributes of your APM agent or in distributed tracing. Solution Verify that the environment variables are being correctly injected by following the instructions described in the Validate your installation step. If they are not present, get the name of the metadata injection pod by running: kubectl get pods | grep newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment kubectl logs -f pod/podname Copy In another terminal, create a new pod (for example, see Validate your installation), and inspect the logs of the metadata injection deployment for errors. For every created pod there should be a set of 4 new entries in the logs like: {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.107Z\",\"caller\":\"server/main.go:139\",\"msg\":\"POST https://newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default.svc:443/mutate?timeout=30s HTTP/2.0\\\" from 10.11.49.2:32836\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.110Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:168\",\"msg\":\"received admission review\",\"kind\":\"/v1, Kind=Pod\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"name\":\"\",\"pod\":\"busybox1\",\"UID\":\"6577519b-7a61-11ea-965e-0e46d1c9335c\",\"operation\":\"CREATE\",\"userinfo\":{\"username\":\"admin\",\"uid\":\"admin\",\"groups\":[\"system:masters\",\"system:authenticated\"]}} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:182\",\"msg\":\"admission response created\",\"response\":\"[{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env\\\",\\\"value\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"adn_kops\\\"}]},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"spec.nodeName\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.namespace\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.name\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}}]\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:257\",\"msg\":\"writing response\"} Copy If there are no new entries on the logs, it means that the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook service, this could be due to networking rules or security groups rejecting the communication. To check if the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook you should inspect the apiserver logs for errors like: failed calling webhook \"metadata-injection.newrelic.com\": ERROR_REASON Copy To get the apiserver logs: Start a proxy to the Kubernetes API server by the executing the following command in a terminal window and keep it running. kubectl proxy --port=8001 Copy Create a new pod in your cluster, this will make the apiserver try to communicate with the webhook. The following command will create a busybox. kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Retrieve the apiserver logs. curl localhost:8001/logs/kube-apiserver.log > apiserver.log Copy Delete the busybox container. kubectl delete -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Inspect the logs for errors. grep -E 'failed calling webhook' apiserver.log Copy Remember that one of the requirements for the metadata injection is that the apiserver must be allowed egress to the pods running on the cluster. If you encounter errors regarding connection timeouts or failed connections, make sure to check the security groups and firewall rules of the cluster. If there are no log entries in either the apiserver logs or the metadata injection deployment, it means that the webhook was not properly registered. Ensure the metadata injection setup job ran successfully by inspecting the output of: kubectl get job newrelic-metadata-setup Copy If the job is not completed, investigate the logs of the setup job: kubectl logs job/newrelic-metadata-setup Copy Ensure the CertificateSigningRequest is approved and issued by running: kubectl get csr newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default Copy Ensure the TLS secret is present by running: kubectl get secret newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Ensure the CA bundle is present in the mutating webhook configuration: kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg -o json Copy Ensure the TargetPort of the Service resource matches the Port of the Deployment's container: kubectl describe service/newrelic-metadata-injection-svc kubectl describe deployment/newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment Copy",

      "body": "With New Relic's Kubernetes integration you can monitor both Kubernetes and the services running on it, such as Cassandra, Redis, MySQL, and other supported services. Get started Our Kubernetes integration comes bundled with some of our on-host integrations (like Cassandra, MySQL, and Apache). This lets you get data for those supported services by adding a section to the Kubernetes integration's configuration, which lives as a ConfigMap inside a manifest. What you need Enable this feature for a service Details about how configuration works For an example of how to monitor Redis running on a Kubernetes PHP Guestbook, see this tutorial. What you need To monitor services running on Kubernetes, you only need a Kubernetes cluster running the Kubernetes integration, version 1.13.0 or higher (install | check version | update). We support the following services running on Kubernetes: Apache (does not report inventory data) Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ (does not report inventory data) Redis SNMP Enable monitoring of services To enable our Kubernetes integration to monitor one or more services: Expand this dropdown and get the YAML snippets for the service(s) you want to monitor: Get the config YAML for the integration For the services you want to monitor, follow the links to GitHub to get the YAML snippets you'll need for the next step: Apache Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ Redis SNMP Add the snippet to the Kubernetes integration's ConfigMap, after the data: section: Example configuration This example shows the YAML config for the Apache integration ( highlighted ) added to the Kubernetes integration's config.

See an example. Depending on your environment, you may need or want to set additional config options. Expand the dropdown below for links to configuration options. Configuration options for each integration Select a service to see available config options: Apache Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ Redis SNMP Verify monitoring is enabled: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure, select Third party services, and then select the service's dashboard. You should see data being reported. Additional notes about enabling services: Enabling multiple services may use more resources than what is set in the resource limits of the Kubernetes integration config file. If this becomes an issue, raise the limit in the resources section. The Kubernetes integration does not automatically update. For best results, regularly update. Monitor services in our Kubernetes integration installed with Helm If you installed our Kubernetes integration using Helm, to monitor services you need to update the existing installation with the new configuration, which contains the services to monitor: helm upgrade --reuse-values -f values.yaml [RELEASE] [CHART] Copy If you use nri-bundle charts, you need to update the children's chart values. Find some examples here. Learn more More resources for learning about configuration: Learn technical details about how configuration works. Learn how to configure monitoring of multiple services with the same config file. See a step-by-step tutorial showing how to monitor a Redis service on Kubernetes. Manually configure service monitoring The enable procedure should be all you need to get monitoring working, but if you run into problems, understanding some technical details about configuration can be helpful. This section goes into more detail about how configuration works. For each service you wish to monitor, you must add a configuration file for that integration to our Kubernetes integration's configuration. This document will cover these subjects: How the service-specific configuration YAML snippet works Adding the service-specific YAML in the Kubernetes integration's config file Adding multiple services to the Kubernetes integration's config file How the service-specific YAML config works Our Kubernetes integration's configuration follows the ConfigMap format. Using a ConfigMap allows us to decouple the configuration for the integrations from the Kubernetes image. The other benefit is that a ConfigMap can be updated automatically without reloading the running container. Because the infrastructure agent uses YAML to configure its associated integrations, ConfigMaps are a good choice for storing YAML. (For more information on config file format, see the Integration config file format.) The Kubernetes integration image comes with an auto-discovery feature that simplifies the configuration of multiple instances of services using a single configuration file. For example, if you have several NGINX instances running, creating an NGINX integration configuration file for every instance would be hard to implement and hard to update. With our auto-discovery option, you can discover and monitor all your NGINX instances with a single configuration file. Each integration has its own specific configuration YAML. Our NGINX integration default config file looks like this: nginx-config.yml: | --- discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet. Default is 10255 # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # Custom Example: # exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes --namespaces namespace1,namespace2 --port 10250 --tls # Default exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes match: label.app: nginx integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}/status STATUS_MODULE: discover METRICS: 1 Copy The above config enables the following: Runs nri-discovery-kubernetes to query the data for the node we are currently on. Parses the data that comes back and looks for any Kubernetes pod that has a Kubernetes container with an app= label with value nginx. For any matches, it attempts to run the NGINX integration. The status URL is built from: The pod's IP address The status page is pulled from the label on K8s pod called status_url This automatic discovery works the same as the container auto-discovery used by the infrastructure agent. For more advanced options, see Container auto-discovery. Add a service YAML to the Kubernetes integration config It's best practice to configure enabled integrations alongside the Kubernetes integration configuration. This is easier than maintaining configuration files for every single service/integration instance. Below is an example of a Kubernetes integration's ConfigMap. The highlighted section shows where an integration configuration YAML (in this case, NGINX) is placed. For more information on discovery:, see Container auto-discovery for on-host integrations. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet.

Make sure the namespace used is the same one used by the Kubernetes integration manifest. If you haven't changed it in the downloaded manifest file, the value is default. Add multiple services to the same config You can monitor several services using the same Kubernetes integration config file. To do this, add another integration configuration YAML to the same Kubernetes integration config file. Below is the Kubernetes config created in the last section, with a new section for the Cassandra integration's config (highlighted). --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Run discovery for Kubernetes.

Additionally, depending on your environment, there may be some additional service-specific configuration you must do. When you've completed configuration, our infrastructure agent looks for any pod with a label cassandra and runs the integration against it.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Kubernetes integration you can monitor both Kubernetes and the services running on it, such as Cassandra, Redis, MySQL, and other supported services. Get started Our Kubernetes integration comes bundled with some of our on-host integrations (like Cassandra, MySQL, and Apache). This lets you get data for those supported services by adding a section to the Kubernetes integration's configuration, which lives as a ConfigMap inside a manifest. What you need Enable this feature for a service Details about how configuration works For an example of how to monitor Redis running on a Kubernetes PHP Guestbook, see this tutorial. What you need To monitor services running on Kubernetes, you only need a Kubernetes cluster running the Kubernetes integration, version 1.13.0 or higher (install | check version | update). We support the following services running on Kubernetes: Apache (does not report inventory data) Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ (does not report inventory data) Redis SNMP Enable monitoring of services To enable our Kubernetes integration to monitor one or more services: Expand this dropdown and get the YAML snippets for the service(s) you want to monitor: Get the config YAML for the integration For the services you want to monitor, follow the links to GitHub to get the YAML snippets you'll need for the next step: Apache Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ Redis SNMP Add the snippet to the Kubernetes integration's ConfigMap, after the data: section: Example configuration This example shows the YAML config for the Apache integration ( highlighted ) added to the Kubernetes integration's config.

Configuration options for each integration Select a service to see available config options: Apache Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ Redis SNMP Verify monitoring is enabled: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure, select Third party services, and then select the service's dashboard. You should see data being reported. Additional notes about enabling services: Enabling multiple services may use more resources than what is set in the resource limits of the Kubernetes integration config file. If this becomes an issue, raise the limit in the resources section. The Kubernetes integration does not automatically update. For best results, regularly update. Monitor services in our Kubernetes integration installed with Helm If you installed our Kubernetes integration using Helm, to monitor services you need to update the existing installation with the new configuration, which contains the services to monitor: helm upgrade --reuse-values -f values.yaml [RELEASE] [CHART] Copy If you use nri-bundle charts, you need to update the children's chart values. Find some examples here. Learn more More resources for learning about configuration: Learn technical details about how configuration works. Learn how to configure monitoring of multiple services with the same config file. See a step-by-step tutorial showing how to monitor a Redis service on Kubernetes. Manually configure service monitoring The enable procedure should be all you need to get monitoring working, but if you run into problems, understanding some technical details about configuration can be helpful. This section goes into more detail about how configuration works. For each service you wish to monitor, you must add a configuration file for that integration to our Kubernetes integration's configuration. This document will cover these subjects: How the service-specific configuration YAML snippet works Adding the service-specific YAML in the Kubernetes integration's config file Adding multiple services to the Kubernetes integration's config file How the service-specific YAML config works Our Kubernetes integration's configuration follows the ConfigMap format. Using a ConfigMap allows us to decouple the configuration for the integrations from the Kubernetes image. The other benefit is that a ConfigMap can be updated automatically without reloading the running container. Because the infrastructure agent uses YAML to configure its associated integrations, ConfigMaps are a good choice for storing YAML. (For more information on config file format, see the Integration config file format.) The Kubernetes integration image comes with an auto-discovery feature that simplifies the configuration of multiple instances of services using a single configuration file. For example, if you have several NGINX instances running, creating an NGINX integration configuration file for every instance would be hard to implement and hard to update. With our auto-discovery option, you can discover and monitor all your NGINX instances with a single configuration file. Each integration has its own specific configuration YAML. Our NGINX integration default config file looks like this: nginx-config.yml: | --- discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet. Default is 10255 # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # Custom Example: # exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes --namespaces namespace1,namespace2 --port 10250 --tls # Default exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes match: label.app: nginx integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}/status STATUS_MODULE: discover METRICS: 1 Copy The above config enables the following: Runs nri-discovery-kubernetes to query the data for the node we are currently on. Parses the data that comes back and looks for any Kubernetes pod that has a Kubernetes container with an app= label with value nginx. For any matches, it attempts to run the NGINX integration. The status URL is built from: The pod's IP address The status page is pulled from the label on K8s pod called status_url This automatic discovery works the same as the container auto-discovery used by the infrastructure agent. For more advanced options, see Container auto-discovery. Add a service YAML to the Kubernetes integration config It's best practice to configure enabled integrations alongside the Kubernetes integration configuration. This is easier than maintaining configuration files for every single service/integration instance. Below is an example of a Kubernetes integration's ConfigMap. The highlighted section shows where an integration configuration YAML (in this case, NGINX) is placed. For more information on discovery:, see Container auto-discovery for on-host integrations. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet.

Make sure the namespace used is the same one used by the Kubernetes integration manifest. If you haven't changed it in the downloaded manifest file, the value is default. Add multiple services to the same config You can monitor several services using the same Kubernetes integration config file. To do this, add another integration configuration YAML to the same Kubernetes integration config file. Below is the Kubernetes config created in the last section, with a new section for the Cassandra integration's config (highlighted). --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Run discovery for Kubernetes.

Additionally, depending on your environment, there may be some additional service-specific configuration you must do.

It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "The New Relic Kubernetes events integration watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. To visualize your event data, use the Kubernetes cluster explorer in New Relic One platform, or use the infrastructure events UI. Requirements The Kubernetes events integration requires you to: Install and activate the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Configure a Kubernetes pod with the label app.kubernetes.io/name=nri-kube-events and two containers, one used to capture events in the Kubernetes cluster and the other to forward the events to New Relic. Install the Kubernetes events integration Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. To install the New Relic Kubernetes events integration in a Kubernetes environment: Download the integration manifest YAML file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/nri-kube-events-latest.yaml Copy Edit the nri-kube-events-latest.yaml manifest file, adding both a cluster name, to identify your Kubernetes cluster (required), and your New Relic license key (required). clusterName: \"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" [...] - name: \"NRIA_LICENSE_KEY\" value: \"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Deploy the integration in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f nri-kube-events-latest.yaml Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then go to one.newrelic.com > Query builder, and run the following NRQL query to see if data has been reported: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' since 1 hour ago Copy View your Kubernetes events Once you have successfully installed the Kubernetes event integration, you can view and query your events in New Relic. To add events to your New Relic One dashboard: Add a chart to a new or existing dashboard or create a chart using the New Relic query builder. When creating or updating your chart, select the chart type table and use the following event query, replacing YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT event.involvedObject.kind,event.involvedObject.name,event.reason,event.message WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' limit 100 Copy Query events Here are a few examples to query your data: Get attributes names To see all the attributes names, use the following query: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT keyset() WHERE category = 'kubernetes' Copy See event details To see details about the latest events in a cluster, use the following query, replacing YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT event.involvedObject.kind, event.involvedObject.name, event.type, event.message, event.reason WHERE category = 'kubernetes' AND clusterName='YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME'​ Copy The events collected by New Relic will have the exact same attributes as given by Kubernetes. For a reference of these attributes, see the Kubernetes documentation's event v1 core reference. Search events in New Relic To search events in the New Relic Infrastructure UI: Navigate to the Infrastructure event page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Events. In Category, select kubernetes. Use the Search events field to look for specific events. To focus on a specific set of events, select or change the filter set. View events in the Kubernetes cluster explorer To view events in the Kubernetes cluster explorer, use either of these methods: In New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer. Then, to view the pod details: In the Kubernetes cluster explorer, select a pod. Select Show pod events. Optional: Collect metrics of the event collector To collect metric data for the event collector itself, install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. To get started: Install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Label the deployment of your Kubernetes events integration with your configured scrape label (default is prometheus.io/scrape=true). Optional: Define custom attributes To add custom attributes to the events sent by the integration these need to be specified as environment variables following the nomenclature NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_attributeKey=attributeValue. These environment variables should be defined as part of the spec for the kube-events container. For example, to add the attribute environment with value staging to all the events, add the following to your manifest: env: - name: NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_environment value: dev Copy Be sure to specify the environment in the spec for the kube-events container, making your manifest look something like this: ... kind: Deployment ... spec: ... template: ... spec: containers: - name: kube-events ... env: - name: NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_environment value: dev Copy Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips when using the Kubernetes events integration. Get logs on event collection To check the logs of our event collector: kubectl logs deploy/nr-kube-events kube-events Copy To add more details, enable verbose mode by adding verbose: \"true\" in the config section of you configuration file, either before or after the clusterName.

      "body": "To generate verbose logs and get version and configuration information, follow these procedures. Get verbose logs For the Kubernetes integration, the infrastructure agent adds a log entry only in the event of an error. Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you are doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. Caution Verbose mode significantly increases the amount of infor sent to log files. Temporarily enable this mode only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. To get verbose logging details: Enable verbose logging: In the deployment file, set the value of NRIA_VERBOSE to 1. Apply the modified configuration by running: kubectl apply -f your_newrelic_k8s.yaml Copy Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until you feel enough activity has occurred. Disable verbose mode: Set the NRIA_VERBOSE value back to 0. Apply the restored configuration by running: kubectl apply -f your_newrelic_k8s.yaml Copy Get a list of nodes in the environment: kubectl get nodes --all-namespaces Copy Get a list of infrastructure and kube-state-metrics pods: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide | egrep 'newrelic|kube-state-metrics' Copy Get logs from the pod connecting to kube-state-metrics. Retrieve kube-state-metrics service configuration. Get the infrastructure agent version For the Kubernetes integration, the infrastructure agent is distributed as a Docker image that contains the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration. The Docker image is tagged with a version, and the infrastructure agent also has its own version. When the agent is successfully sending information to New Relic, you can retrieve the versions of the infrastructure agent for Kubernetes (the Docker image) you are running in your clusters by using the following Insights query: FROM K8sContainerSample SELECT uniqueCount(entityId) WHERE containerName = 'newrelic-infra' facet clusterName, containerImage Copy If the agent is not reporting any data: Get the version(s) of the New Relic integration for Kubernetes that you are running in a cluster using kubectl: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -l name=newrelic-infra -o jsonpath=\"{.items..spec..containers..image}\" Copy Look for output similar to this: newrelic/infrastructure-k8s:1.0.0 Copy Get kube-state-metrics version To retrieve the version of kube-state-metrics running on your clusters, run the following Insights NRQL query: FROM K8sContainerSample SELECT uniqueCount(entityId) WHERE containerName LIKE '%kube-state-metrics%' facet clusterName, containerImage Copy Get logs from pod connecting to kube-state-metrics To get the logs from the pod connecting to kube-state-metrics: Get the node that kube-state-metrics is running on: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Look for output similar to this: kube-system kube-state-metrics-5c6f5cb9b5-pclhh 2/2 Running 4 4d 172.17.0.3 minikube Copy Get the New Relic pod that is running on the same node as kube-state-metrics: kubectl describe node minikube | grep newrelic-infra Copy Look for output similar to this: default newrelic-infra-5wcv6 100m (5%) 0 (0%) 100Mi (5%) 100Mi (5%) Copy Retrieve the logs for that node by running: kubectl logs newrelic-infra-5wcv6 Copy Retrieve kube-state-metrics service configuration To retrieve the configuration: Run: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep \"kube-state-metrics\" Copy Look for a response similar to this: kube-system kube-state-metrics-5c6f5cb9b5-5wf9m 2/2 Running 8 6d Copy Review the namespace in the first column. kubectl describe service kube-state-metrics -n <namespace> Copy Get logs from pod running on a master node To get the logs from a pod running on a master node: Get the nodes that are labelled as master: kubectl get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" Copy Or, kubectl get nodes -l kubernetes.io/role=\"master\" Copy Look for output similar to this: NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION ip-10-42-24-4.ec2.internal Ready master 42d v1.14.8 Copy Get the New Relic pod that is running on one of the nodes returned in the previous step: kubectl get pods --field-selector spec.nodeName=ip-10-42-24-4.ec2.internal -l name=newrelic-infra --all-namespaces Copy Look for output similar to this: newrelic-infra-whvzt Copy Retrieve the logs for that node by running: kubectl logs newrelic-infra-whvzt Copy For troubleshooting help, see Not seeing data or Error messages.

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "The New Relic Kubernetes events integration watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. To visualize your event data, use the Kubernetes cluster explorer in New Relic One platform, or use the infrastructure events UI. Requirements The Kubernetes events integration requires you to: Install and activate the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Configure a Kubernetes pod with the label app.kubernetes.io/name=nri-kube-events and two containers, one used to capture events in the Kubernetes cluster and the other to forward the events to New Relic. Install the Kubernetes events integration Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. To install the New Relic Kubernetes events integration in a Kubernetes environment: Download the integration manifest YAML file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/nri-kube-events-latest.yaml Copy Edit the nri-kube-events-latest.yaml manifest file, adding both a cluster name, to identify your Kubernetes cluster (required), and your New Relic license key (required). clusterName: \"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" [...] - name: \"NRIA_LICENSE_KEY\" value: \"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Deploy the integration in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f nri-kube-events-latest.yaml Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then go to one.newrelic.com > Query builder, and run the following NRQL query to see if data has been reported: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' since 1 hour ago Copy View your Kubernetes events Once you have successfully installed the Kubernetes event integration, you can view and query your events in New Relic. To add events to your New Relic One dashboard: Add a chart to a new or existing dashboard or create a chart using the New Relic query builder. When creating or updating your chart, select the chart type table and use the following event query, replacing YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT event.involvedObject.kind,event.involvedObject.name,event.reason,event.message WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' limit 100 Copy Query events Here are a few examples to query your data: Get attributes names To see all the attributes names, use the following query: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT keyset() WHERE category = 'kubernetes' Copy See event details To see details about the latest events in a cluster, use the following query, replacing YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT event.involvedObject.kind, event.involvedObject.name, event.type, event.message, event.reason WHERE category = 'kubernetes' AND clusterName='YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME'​ Copy The events collected by New Relic will have the exact same attributes as given by Kubernetes. For a reference of these attributes, see the Kubernetes documentation's event v1 core reference. Search events in New Relic To search events in the New Relic Infrastructure UI: Navigate to the Infrastructure event page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Events. In Category, select kubernetes. Use the Search events field to look for specific events. To focus on a specific set of events, select or change the filter set. View events in the Kubernetes cluster explorer To view events in the Kubernetes cluster explorer, use either of these methods: In New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer. Then, to view the pod details: In the Kubernetes cluster explorer, select a pod. Select Show pod events. Optional: Collect metrics of the event collector To collect metric data for the event collector itself, install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. To get started: Install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Label the deployment of your Kubernetes events integration with your configured scrape label (default is prometheus.io/scrape=true). Optional: Define custom attributes To add custom attributes to the events sent by the integration these need to be specified as environment variables following the nomenclature NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_attributeKey=attributeValue. These environment variables should be defined as part of the spec for the kube-events container. For example, to add the attribute environment with value staging to all the events, add the following to your manifest: env: - name: NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_environment value: dev Copy Be sure to specify the environment in the spec for the kube-events container, making your manifest look something like this: ... kind: Deployment ... spec: ... template: ... spec: containers: - name: kube-events ... env: - name: NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_environment value: dev Copy Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips when using the Kubernetes events integration. Get logs on event collection To check the logs of our event collector: kubectl logs deploy/nr-kube-events kube-events Copy To add more details, enable verbose mode by adding verbose: \"true\" in the config section of you configuration file, either before or after the clusterName. Get logs on sending events To check the logs of the agent responsible for sending the events to New Relic: kubectl logs deploy/nr-kube-events infra-agent Copy",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "The New Relic Kubernetes events integration watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. To visualize your event data, use the Kubernetes cluster explorer in New Relic One platform, or use the infrastructure events UI. Requirements The Kubernetes events integration requires you to: Install and activate the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Configure a Kubernetes pod with the label app.kubernetes.io/name=nri-kube-events and two containers, one used to capture events in the Kubernetes cluster and the other to forward the events to New Relic. Install the Kubernetes events integration Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. To install the New Relic Kubernetes events integration in a Kubernetes environment: Download the integration manifest YAML file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/nri-kube-events-latest.yaml Copy Edit the nri-kube-events-latest.yaml manifest file, adding both a cluster name, to identify your Kubernetes cluster (required), and your New Relic license key (required). clusterName: \"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" [...] - name: \"NRIA_LICENSE_KEY\" value: \"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Deploy the integration in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f nri-kube-events-latest.yaml Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then go to one.newrelic.com > Query builder, and run the following NRQL query to see if data has been reported: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' since 1 hour ago Copy View your Kubernetes events Once you have successfully installed the Kubernetes event integration, you can view and query your events in New Relic. To add events to your New Relic One dashboard: Add a chart to a new or existing dashboard or create a chart using the New Relic query builder. When creating or updating your chart, select the chart type table and use the following event query, replacing YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT event.involvedObject.kind,event.involvedObject.name,event.reason,event.message WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' limit 100 Copy Query events Here are a few examples to query your data: Get attributes names To see all the attributes names, use the following query: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT keyset() WHERE category = 'kubernetes' Copy See event details To see details about the latest events in a cluster, use the following query, replacing YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT event.involvedObject.kind, event.involvedObject.name, event.type, event.message, event.reason WHERE category = 'kubernetes' AND clusterName='YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME'​ Copy The events collected by New Relic will have the exact same attributes as given by Kubernetes. For a reference of these attributes, see the Kubernetes documentation's event v1 core reference. Search events in New Relic To search events in the New Relic Infrastructure UI: Navigate to the Infrastructure event page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Events. In Category, select kubernetes. Use the Search events field to look for specific events. To focus on a specific set of events, select or change the filter set. View events in the Kubernetes cluster explorer To view events in the Kubernetes cluster explorer, use either of these methods: In New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer. Then, to view the pod details: In the Kubernetes cluster explorer, select a pod. Select Show pod events. Optional: Collect metrics of the event collector To collect metric data for the event collector itself, install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. To get started: Install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Label the deployment of your Kubernetes events integration with your configured scrape label (default is prometheus.io/scrape=true). Optional: Define custom attributes To add custom attributes to the events sent by the integration these need to be specified as environment variables following the nomenclature NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_attributeKey=attributeValue. These environment variables should be defined as part of the spec for the kube-events container. For example, to add the attribute environment with value staging to all the events, add the following to your manifest: env: - name: NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_environment value: dev Copy Be sure to specify the environment in the spec for the kube-events container, making your manifest look something like this: ... kind: Deployment ... spec: ... template: ... spec: containers: - name: kube-events ... env: - name: NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_environment value: dev Copy Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips when using the Kubernetes events integration. Get logs on event collection To check the logs of our event collector: kubectl logs deploy/nr-kube-events kube-events Copy To add more details, enable verbose mode by adding verbose: \"true\" in the config section of you configuration file, either before or after the clusterName. Get logs on sending events To check the logs of the agent responsible for sending the events to New Relic: kubectl logs deploy/nr-kube-events infra-agent Copy",

Get verbose logs For the Kubernetes integration, the infrastructure agent adds a log entry only in the event of an error. Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you are doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. Caution Verbose mode significantly increases the amount of infor sent to log files. Temporarily enable this mode only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. To get verbose logging details: Enable verbose logging: In the deployment file, set the value of NRIA_VERBOSE to 1. Apply the modified configuration by running: kubectl apply -f your_newrelic_k8s.yaml Copy Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until you feel enough activity has occurred. Disable verbose mode: Set the NRIA_VERBOSE value back to 0. Apply the restored configuration by running: kubectl apply -f your_newrelic_k8s.yaml Copy Get a list of nodes in the environment: kubectl get nodes --all-namespaces Copy Get a list of infrastructure and kube-state-metrics pods: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide | egrep 'newrelic|kube-state-metrics' Copy Get logs from the pod connecting to kube-state-metrics. Retrieve kube-state-metrics service configuration. Get the infrastructure agent version For the Kubernetes integration, the infrastructure agent is distributed as a Docker image that contains the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration. The Docker image is tagged with a version, and the infrastructure agent also has its own version. When the agent is successfully sending information to New Relic, you can retrieve the versions of the infrastructure agent for Kubernetes (the Docker image) you are running in your clusters by using the following Insights query: FROM K8sContainerSample SELECT uniqueCount(entityId) WHERE containerName = 'newrelic-infra' facet clusterName, containerImage Copy If the agent is not reporting any data: Get the version(s) of the New Relic integration for Kubernetes that you are running in a cluster using kubectl: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -l name=newrelic-infra -o jsonpath=\"{.items..spec..containers..image}\" Copy Look for output similar to this: newrelic/infrastructure-k8s:1.0.0 Copy Get kube-state-metrics version To retrieve the version of kube-state-metrics running on your clusters, run the following Insights NRQL query: FROM K8sContainerSample SELECT uniqueCount(entityId) WHERE containerName LIKE '%kube-state-metrics%' facet clusterName, containerImage Copy Get logs from pod connecting to kube-state-metrics To get the logs from the pod connecting to kube-state-metrics: Get the node that kube-state-metrics is running on: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Look for output similar to this: kube-system kube-state-metrics-5c6f5cb9b5-pclhh 2/2 Running 4 4d 172.17.0.3 minikube Copy Get the New Relic pod that is running on the same node as kube-state-metrics: kubectl describe node minikube | grep newrelic-infra Copy Look for output similar to this: default newrelic-infra-5wcv6 100m (5%) 0 (0%) 100Mi (5%) 100Mi (5%) Copy Retrieve the logs for that node by running: kubectl logs newrelic-infra-5wcv6 Copy Retrieve kube-state-metrics service configuration To retrieve the configuration: Run: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep \"kube-state-metrics\" Copy Look for a response similar to this: kube-system kube-state-metrics-5c6f5cb9b5-5wf9m 2/2 Running 8 6d Copy Review the namespace in the first column. kubectl describe service kube-state-metrics -n <namespace> Copy Get logs from pod running on a master node To get the logs from a pod running on a master node: Get the nodes that are labelled as master: kubectl get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" Copy Or, kubectl get nodes -l kubernetes.io/role=\"master\" Copy Look for output similar to this: NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION ip-10-42-24-4.ec2.internal Ready master 42d v1.14.8 Copy Get the New Relic pod that is running on one of the nodes returned in the previous step: kubectl get pods --field-selector spec.nodeName=ip-10-42-24-4.ec2.internal -l name=newrelic-infra --all-namespaces Copy Look for output similar to this: newrelic-infra-whvzt Copy Retrieve the logs for that node by running: kubectl logs newrelic-infra-whvzt Copy For troubleshooting help, see Not seeing data or Error messages.

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "The New Relic Kubernetes events integration watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. To visualize your event data, use the Kubernetes cluster explorer in New Relic One platform, or use the infrastructure events UI. Requirements The Kubernetes events integration requires you to: Install and activate the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Configure a Kubernetes pod with the label app.kubernetes.io/name=nri-kube-events and two containers, one used to capture events in the Kubernetes cluster and the other to forward the events to New Relic. Install the Kubernetes events integration Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. To install the New Relic Kubernetes events integration in a Kubernetes environment: Download the integration manifest YAML file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/nri-kube-events-latest.yaml Copy Edit the nri-kube-events-latest.yaml manifest file, adding both a cluster name, to identify your Kubernetes cluster (required), and your New Relic license key (required). clusterName: \"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" [...] - name: \"NRIA_LICENSE_KEY\" value: \"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Deploy the integration in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f nri-kube-events-latest.yaml Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then go to one.newrelic.com > Query builder, and run the following NRQL query to see if data has been reported: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' since 1 hour ago Copy View your Kubernetes events Once you have successfully installed the Kubernetes event integration, you can view and query your events in New Relic. To add events to your New Relic One dashboard: Add a chart to a new or existing dashboard or create a chart using the New Relic query builder. When creating or updating your chart, select the chart type table and use the following event query, replacing YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT event.involvedObject.kind,event.involvedObject.name,event.reason,event.message WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' limit 100 Copy Query events Here are a few examples to query your data: Get attributes names To see all the attributes names, use the following query: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT keyset() WHERE category = 'kubernetes' Copy See event details To see details about the latest events in a cluster, use the following query, replacing YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT event.involvedObject.kind, event.involvedObject.name, event.type, event.message, event.reason WHERE category = 'kubernetes' AND clusterName='YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME'​ Copy The events collected by New Relic will have the exact same attributes as given by Kubernetes. For a reference of these attributes, see the Kubernetes documentation's event v1 core reference. Search events in New Relic To search events in the New Relic Infrastructure UI: Navigate to the Infrastructure event page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Events. In Category, select kubernetes. Use the Search events field to look for specific events. To focus on a specific set of events, select or change the filter set. View events in the Kubernetes cluster explorer To view events in the Kubernetes cluster explorer, use either of these methods: In New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer. Then, to view the pod details: In the Kubernetes cluster explorer, select a pod. Select Show pod events. Optional: Collect metrics of the event collector To collect metric data for the event collector itself, install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. To get started: Install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Label the deployment of your Kubernetes events integration with your configured scrape label (default is prometheus.io/scrape=true). Optional: Define custom attributes To add custom attributes to the events sent by the integration these need to be specified as environment variables following the nomenclature NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_attributeKey=attributeValue. These environment variables should be defined as part of the spec for the kube-events container. For example, to add the attribute environment with value staging to all the events, add the following to your manifest: env: - name: NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_environment value: dev Copy Be sure to specify the environment in the spec for the kube-events container, making your manifest look something like this: ... kind: Deployment ... spec: ... template: ... spec: containers: - name: kube-events ... env: - name: NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_environment value: dev Copy Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips when using the Kubernetes events integration. Get logs on event collection To check the logs of our event collector: kubectl logs deploy/nr-kube-events kube-events Copy To add more details, enable verbose mode by adding verbose: \"true\" in the config section of you configuration file, either before or after the clusterName. Get logs on sending events To check the logs of the agent responsible for sending the events to New Relic: kubectl logs deploy/nr-kube-events infra-agent Copy",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "The New Relic Kubernetes events integration watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. To visualize your event data, use the Kubernetes cluster explorer in New Relic One platform, or use the infrastructure events UI. Requirements The Kubernetes events integration requires you to: Install and activate the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Configure a Kubernetes pod with the label app.kubernetes.io/name=nri-kube-events and two containers, one used to capture events in the Kubernetes cluster and the other to forward the events to New Relic. Install the Kubernetes events integration Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. To install the New Relic Kubernetes events integration in a Kubernetes environment: Download the integration manifest YAML file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/nri-kube-events-latest.yaml Copy Edit the nri-kube-events-latest.yaml manifest file, adding both a cluster name, to identify your Kubernetes cluster (required), and your New Relic license key (required). clusterName: \"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" [...] - name: \"NRIA_LICENSE_KEY\" value: \"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Deploy the integration in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f nri-kube-events-latest.yaml Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then go to one.newrelic.com > Query builder, and run the following NRQL query to see if data has been reported: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' since 1 hour ago Copy View your Kubernetes events Once you have successfully installed the Kubernetes event integration, you can view and query your events in New Relic. To add events to your New Relic One dashboard: Add a chart to a new or existing dashboard or create a chart using the New Relic query builder. When creating or updating your chart, select the chart type table and use the following event query, replacing YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT event.involvedObject.kind,event.involvedObject.name,event.reason,event.message WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' limit 100 Copy Query events Here are a few examples to query your data: Get attributes names To see all the attributes names, use the following query: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT keyset() WHERE category = 'kubernetes' Copy See event details To see details about the latest events in a cluster, use the following query, replacing YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT event.involvedObject.kind, event.involvedObject.name, event.type, event.message, event.reason WHERE category = 'kubernetes' AND clusterName='YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME'​ Copy The events collected by New Relic will have the exact same attributes as given by Kubernetes. For a reference of these attributes, see the Kubernetes documentation's event v1 core reference. Search events in New Relic To search events in the New Relic Infrastructure UI: Navigate to the Infrastructure event page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Events. In Category, select kubernetes. Use the Search events field to look for specific events. To focus on a specific set of events, select or change the filter set. View events in the Kubernetes cluster explorer To view events in the Kubernetes cluster explorer, use either of these methods: In New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer. Then, to view the pod details: In the Kubernetes cluster explorer, select a pod. Select Show pod events. Optional: Collect metrics of the event collector To collect metric data for the event collector itself, install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. To get started: Install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Label the deployment of your Kubernetes events integration with your configured scrape label (default is prometheus.io/scrape=true). Optional: Define custom attributes To add custom attributes to the events sent by the integration these need to be specified as environment variables following the nomenclature NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_attributeKey=attributeValue. These environment variables should be defined as part of the spec for the kube-events container. For example, to add the attribute environment with value staging to all the events, add the following to your manifest: env: - name: NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_environment value: dev Copy Be sure to specify the environment in the spec for the kube-events container, making your manifest look something like this: ... kind: Deployment ... spec: ... template: ... spec: containers: - name: kube-events ... env: - name: NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_environment value: dev Copy Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips when using the Kubernetes events integration. Get logs on event collection To check the logs of our event collector: kubectl logs deploy/nr-kube-events kube-events Copy To add more details, enable verbose mode by adding verbose: \"true\" in the config section of you configuration file, either before or after the clusterName.

Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "The New Relic Kubernetes events integration watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. To visualize your event data, use the Kubernetes cluster explorer in New Relic One platform, or use the infrastructure events UI. Requirements The Kubernetes events integration requires you to: Install and activate the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Configure a Kubernetes pod with the label app.kubernetes.io/name=nri-kube-events and two containers, one used to capture events in the Kubernetes cluster and the other to forward the events to New Relic. Install the Kubernetes events integration Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. To install the New Relic Kubernetes events integration in a Kubernetes environment: Download the integration manifest YAML file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/nri-kube-events-latest.yaml Copy Edit the nri-kube-events-latest.yaml manifest file, adding both a cluster name, to identify your Kubernetes cluster (required), and your New Relic license key (required). clusterName: \"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" [...] - name: \"NRIA_LICENSE_KEY\" value: \"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Deploy the integration in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f nri-kube-events-latest.yaml Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then go to one.newrelic.com > Query builder, and run the following NRQL query to see if data has been reported: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' since 1 hour ago Copy View your Kubernetes events Once you have successfully installed the Kubernetes event integration, you can view and query your events in New Relic. To add events to your New Relic One dashboard: Add a chart to a new or existing dashboard or create a chart using the New Relic query builder. When creating or updating your chart, select the chart type table and use the following event query, replacing YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT event.involvedObject.kind,event.involvedObject.name,event.reason,event.message WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' limit 100 Copy Query events Here are a few examples to query your data: Get attributes names To see all the attributes names, use the following query: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT keyset() WHERE category = 'kubernetes' Copy See event details To see details about the latest events in a cluster, use the following query, replacing YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT event.involvedObject.kind, event.involvedObject.name, event.type, event.message, event.reason WHERE category = 'kubernetes' AND clusterName='YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME'​ Copy The events collected by New Relic will have the exact same attributes as given by Kubernetes. For a reference of these attributes, see the Kubernetes documentation's event v1 core reference. Search events in New Relic To search events in the New Relic Infrastructure UI: Navigate to the Infrastructure event page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Events. In Category, select kubernetes. Use the Search events field to look for specific events. To focus on a specific set of events, select or change the filter set. View events in the Kubernetes cluster explorer To view events in the Kubernetes cluster explorer, use either of these methods: In New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer. Then, to view the pod details: In the Kubernetes cluster explorer, select a pod. Select Show pod events. Optional: Collect metrics of the event collector To collect metric data for the event collector itself, install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. To get started: Install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Label the deployment of your Kubernetes events integration with your configured scrape label (default is prometheus.io/scrape=true). Optional: Define custom attributes To add custom attributes to the events sent by the integration these need to be specified as environment variables following the nomenclature NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_attributeKey=attributeValue. These environment variables should be defined as part of the spec for the kube-events container. For example, to add the attribute environment with value staging to all the events, add the following to your manifest: env: - name: NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_environment value: dev Copy Be sure to specify the environment in the spec for the kube-events container, making your manifest look something like this: ... kind: Deployment ... spec: ... template: ... spec: containers: - name: kube-events ... env: - name: NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_environment value: dev Copy Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips when using the Kubernetes events integration. Get logs on event collection To check the logs of our event collector: kubectl logs deploy/nr-kube-events kube-events Copy To add more details, enable verbose mode by adding verbose: \"true\" in the config section of you configuration file, either before or after the clusterName.

      "body": "To generate verbose logs and get version and configuration information, follow these procedures. Get verbose logs For the Kubernetes integration, the infrastructure agent adds a log entry only in the event of an error. Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you are doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. Caution Verbose mode significantly increases the amount of infor sent to log files. Temporarily enable this mode only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. To get verbose logging details: Enable verbose logging: In the deployment file, set the value of NRIA_VERBOSE to 1. Apply the modified configuration by running: kubectl apply -f your_newrelic_k8s.yaml Copy Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until you feel enough activity has occurred. Disable verbose mode: Set the NRIA_VERBOSE value back to 0. Apply the restored configuration by running: kubectl apply -f your_newrelic_k8s.yaml Copy Get a list of nodes in the environment: kubectl get nodes --all-namespaces Copy Get a list of infrastructure and kube-state-metrics pods: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide | egrep 'newrelic|kube-state-metrics' Copy Get logs from the pod connecting to kube-state-metrics. Retrieve kube-state-metrics service configuration. Get the infrastructure agent version For the Kubernetes integration, the infrastructure agent is distributed as a Docker image that contains the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration. The Docker image is tagged with a version, and the infrastructure agent also has its own version. When the agent is successfully sending information to New Relic, you can retrieve the versions of the infrastructure agent for Kubernetes (the Docker image) you are running in your clusters by using the following Insights query: FROM K8sContainerSample SELECT uniqueCount(entityId) WHERE containerName = 'newrelic-infra' facet clusterName, containerImage Copy If the agent is not reporting any data: Get the version(s) of the New Relic integration for Kubernetes that you are running in a cluster using kubectl: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -l name=newrelic-infra -o jsonpath=\"{.items..spec..containers..image}\" Copy Look for output similar to this: newrelic/infrastructure-k8s:1.0.0 Copy Get kube-state-metrics version To retrieve the version of kube-state-metrics running on your clusters, run the following Insights NRQL query: FROM K8sContainerSample SELECT uniqueCount(entityId) WHERE containerName LIKE '%kube-state-metrics%' facet clusterName, containerImage Copy Get logs from pod connecting to kube-state-metrics To get the logs from the pod connecting to kube-state-metrics: Get the node that kube-state-metrics is running on: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Look for output similar to this: kube-system kube-state-metrics-5c6f5cb9b5-pclhh 2/2 Running 4 4d 172.17.0.3 minikube Copy Get the New Relic pod that is running on the same node as kube-state-metrics: kubectl describe node minikube | grep newrelic-infra Copy Look for output similar to this: default newrelic-infra-5wcv6 100m (5%) 0 (0%) 100Mi (5%) 100Mi (5%) Copy Retrieve the logs for that node by running: kubectl logs newrelic-infra-5wcv6 Copy Retrieve kube-state-metrics service configuration To retrieve the configuration: Run: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep \"kube-state-metrics\" Copy Look for a response similar to this: kube-system kube-state-metrics-5c6f5cb9b5-5wf9m 2/2 Running 8 6d Copy Review the namespace in the first column. kubectl describe service kube-state-metrics -n <namespace> Copy Get logs from pod running on a master node To get the logs from a pod running on a master node: Get the nodes that are labelled as master: kubectl get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" Copy Or, kubectl get nodes -l kubernetes.io/role=\"master\" Copy Look for output similar to this: NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION ip-10-42-24-4.ec2.internal Ready master 42d v1.14.8 Copy Get the New Relic pod that is running on one of the nodes returned in the previous step: kubectl get pods --field-selector spec.nodeName=ip-10-42-24-4.ec2.internal -l name=newrelic-infra --all-namespaces Copy Look for output similar to this: newrelic-infra-whvzt Copy Retrieve the logs for that node by running: kubectl logs newrelic-infra-whvzt Copy For troubleshooting help, see Not seeing data or Error messages.

      "body": "Important Auto-telemetry with Pixie is a supported public beta. Therefore, the features and functionality are subject to change. By joining the beta for Auto-telemetry with Pixie, you agree to the terms in the New Relic Pre-Release Policy. When we say auto-telemetry, we’re not talking about cars — we’re talking about automatically collecting telemetry data for your Kubernetes clusters. With our Pixie integration, you no longer have to manually instrument your clusters or change code. With one install command, you get observability into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Pixie collects telemetry data using eBPF, a virtual machine-like construct in the Linux kernel. eBPF makes it easy to collect similar data about your clusters and workloads as with traditional New Relic language agents, but now without needing to update your code. Simply put, Auto-telemetry with Pixie offers the quickest option for getting observability into your Kubernetes services. Why it matters Our Pixie integration gives you the best of both worlds: Pixie’s fast and simple Kubernetes observability coupled with New Relic One’s incident correlation, intelligent alerting, and long-term retention. You’ll get visibility into HTTP services using golden signals, HTTP transactions, database transactions, distributed tracing, and JVM metrics. You can operate, debug, and scale your Kubernetes clusters based on the information you learn about how your clusters and services are running. Using the New Relic Explorer, you can see key metrics and events at every level, starting with the cluster, and diving down into namespaces, deployments, and pods. You can quickly spot anomalous behavior, and where it’s happening. If you need further insight, you can easily link over to Pixie's native UI for advanced debugging with PXL scripts. Install Auto-telemetry with Pixie Use our guided installation process to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie. This deploys Pixie with New Relic's Kubernetes integration on your cluster. You don't need to do any further configuration or installation to start using Pixie. If you want to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie on multiple clusters, re-run the guided install for each additional cluster. Beta limitations The following are not supported in this beta version of Auto-telemetry with Pixie: OpenShift. While our New Relic infrastructure agent supports OpenShift, Pixie does not. RBAC. New Relic RBAC controls cannot be used to gate access to Pixie. This means the following: Auto-telemetry with Pixie creates one project for all of your Kubernetes clusters users from the same email domain are automatically allowed access to the project all users have full permissions on the project Before you begin The guided install requires the following (you can get these set up before you begin, or during the install steps): a Pixie account You need a Google account to sign up for Pixie. a Pixie API key Sufficient memory: Pixie requires 2Gb of memory per node. Start the guided installation Open our New Relic One guided install. Select the account you want to use for the guided install, and click Continue. Note: if you have a single account, you won't see this option. Select Kubernetes. Type in a name for your cluster, and select the check box to Gather telemetry automatically with Pixie beta. Important Currently, Pixie performs best on clusters with up to 100 nodes (exceeding 100 nodes can lead to excessive memory usage and scripts failing to run). Friendly reminder: autoscaling can quickly drive up your node numbers. If Pixie is already running on your cluster, expand the Advanced options section and select the appropriate check box. We strongly recommend enabling Pixie auto update to maintain the latest Pixie version. Click Continue. Provide your Pixie API key. If you already have a key, simply paste it in the API key box, and click Continue. If you don't have an account and existing API key, click the link to create a Pixie account. Then, on the API key page, click New key to add a new key. In the Actions column, click the ellipsis, and then click Copy value. Switch back to the guided install UI, paste the value into the API key box, and click Continue. When you click Continue, the API key is added to your New Relic account, and a deploy key is created for Pixie. Your Pixie account information is now stored on your New Relic account; if you follow the install steps again, you won't be asked for this information. On the Choose install method page, copy the Helm command that's provided, and then run it on your command line. Helm installs a bundle containing the New Relic infrastructure agent, an integration to gather Prometheus metrics and Kubernetes events, and the Pixie integration. The deployment takes a few minutes to complete. To see the status of the install to the cluster, run kubectl get pods -n newrelic. In the New Relic install UI, click Continue to open the Listening for data page. When you get the message, See your data, click Kubernetes Cluster Explorer to see your cluster. Note that Auto-telemetry with Pixie might restart after installation. This is caused by the auto update feature. Explore your cluster In the cluster explorer, you can get a quick overview of the nodes in your cluster, including CPU, memory, and storage, as well as the status of each pod (healthy, warning, or critical). You can also find out what services are running in each container, their latency, throughput, and error rate. For more information about using the cluster explorer, see Navigate the Kubernetes cluster explorer. Tip Containers might be listed for up to four hours after they get decommissioned. You can query the Pixie data that's available in New Relic One and create dashboards for at-a-glance monitoring. Find the data model and sample queries here. In addition to analyzing the performance of your clusters in New Relic One, you might want to use Pixie's advanced debugging workflows. In Pixie's native UI, you can drill down further into header and content requests. Click Explore service in Pixie to see information about your service in the Pixie UI. Learn more about writing PXL scripts in the Pixie docs.",

Data collection and reporting process This is how an infrastructure on-host integration sends data to New Relic: On startup, the infrastructure agent scans the directory that contains the integration's definition files.

If those config files specify integrations that have been registered with the infrastructure agent, the agent sets up and schedules the integrations. At the scheduled interval (the default is 15 seconds), the agent harvests the data from the integration and prepares it for transmission. Every 60 seconds, it sends that data to New Relic, along with any other infrastructure data. After a successful collection pass, the integration executable exits.

      "body": "From a New Relic perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything New Relic can identify that has data you can monitor. Integrations can be configured to create their own entity, called a remote entity, by setting the remote_monitoring option to true. If set to false, an integration will be considered a local entity, and the data related to it will be attached to the host entity that the agent creates. Remote monitoring requires infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher. For the Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, and Redis integrations, remote monitoring (and multi-tenancy) is enabled by activating the configuration parameter remote_monitoring. Important If your Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, or Redis service is located in the same host as the agent, when you activate remote monitoring the resulting entity will be considered as remote, regardless of its actual location. This may affect alerts, alter attributes, and have other effects, as explained here. Effects of activating remote_monitoring By enabling remote_monitoring, the integration becomes a different entity which is no longer attached to the infrastructure agent. As a result, the following items may be affected: Alert verification Enabling remote monitoring can affect your configured alerts in case they are using any of the values that are affected by this new feature. We strongly recommend checking your existing alerts to make sure they keep on working as expected. New entity attributes These attributes are modified in the resulting entity: Display name: New entity unique key (instead of using the display name) Entity GUID: New entity GUID Entity ID: New entity ID Entity key: New entity unique key (instead of using the display name) External key: Using integration entity name (instead of using the agent display) Changes in recorded metrics When remote monitoring is enabled, we will add the hostname and port values to all metrics. If the nricluster name or nriservice are defined in the integration configuration file, they will also be decorated. Unrecorded attributes Since the integration is now an independent entity which is not attached to the agent, the following agent attributes are not collected: agentName agentVersion coreCount criticalViolationCount fullHostname instanceType kernelVersion linuxDistribution entityType operatingSystem processorCount systemMemoryBytes warningViolationCount Your custom attributes Updated hostname For the ApacheSample, RedisSample, CassandraSample, and NginxSample integration metrics, we will use the integration configuration hostname instead of the short hostname from the agent. When the integration hostname is a loopback address, the agent will replace it in order to guarantee uniqueness.",

Our integration collects Kubernetes data by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. For a simpler and more visual experience, use the cluster explorer. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can query your Kubernetes data and create clear visualizations. Query Kubernetes data The simplest way to query your Kubernetes data is using the query builder, which accepts NRQL queries in its advanced mode. Alternatively, you can use the NerdGraph API to retrieve Kubernetes data.

To filter the alert to Kubernetes entities that only have the chosen attributes, select Filter. Select the threshold settings. For more on the Trigger an alert when... options, see Alert types. Select an existing alert policy, or create a new one. Select Create. When an alert condition's threshold is triggered, New Relic sends a notification to the policy's notification channels. Use the predefined alert types and thresholds The Kubernetes integration comes with its own alert policy and alert conditions. To see what the predefined alert conditions are, see Kubernetes integration: Predefined alert policy. In addition, you can create an alert condition for any metric collected by any New Relic integration you use, including the Kubernetes integration: Select the alert type Integrations. From the Select a data source dropdown, select a Kubernetes (K8s) data source. Select alert notifications When an alert condition's threshold is triggered, New Relic sends a message to the notification channel(s) chosen in the alert policy. Depending on the type of notification, you may have the following options: View the incident. Acknowledge the incident. Go to a chart of the incident data by selecting the identifier name. The entity identifier that triggered the alert appears near the top of the notification message. The format of the identifier depends on the alert type: Available pods are less than desired pods alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:replicaset:REPLICASET_NAME Copy CPU or memory usage alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:POD_NAME:container:CONTAINER_NAME Copy Here are some examples. Pod alert notification example For Available pods are less than desired pods alerts, the ID of the ReplicaSet triggering the issue might look like this: k8s:beam-production:default:replicaset:nginx-deployment-1623441481 Copy This identifier contains the following information: Cluster name: beam-production Parent namespace: default ReplicaSet name: nginx-deployment-1623441481 Container resource notification example For container CPU or memory usage alerts, the entity might look like this: k8s:beam-production:kube-system:kube-state-metrics-797bb87c75-zncwn:container:kube-state-metrics Copy This identifier contains the following information: Cluster name: beam-production Parent namespace: kube-system Pod namespace: kube-state-metrics-797bb87c75-zncwn Container name: kube-state-metrics Create alert conditions using NRQL Follow standard procedures to create alert conditions for NRQL queries.

If those config files specify integrations that have been registered with the infrastructure agent, the agent sets up and schedules the integrations. At the scheduled interval (the default is 15 seconds), the agent harvests the data from the integration and prepares it for transmission. Every 60 seconds, it sends that data to New Relic, along with any other infrastructure data. After a successful collection pass, the integration executable exits. File structure and specifications Understanding the file structure of New Relic on-host integrations can help you customize your integration, understand and use your data, and troubleshoot problems. On-host integrations adhere to a set of open source specifications, allowing anyone to build their own infrastructure on-host integration. For an explanation of these file specifications, see File specs.",

      "body": "From a New Relic perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything New Relic can identify that has data you can monitor. Integrations can be configured to create their own entity, called a remote entity, by setting the remote_monitoring option to true. If set to false, an integration will be considered a local entity, and the data related to it will be attached to the host entity that the agent creates. Remote monitoring requires infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher. For the Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, and Redis integrations, remote monitoring (and multi-tenancy) is enabled by activating the configuration parameter remote_monitoring. Important If your Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, or Redis service is located in the same host as the agent, when you activate remote monitoring the resulting entity will be considered as remote, regardless of its actual location. This may affect alerts, alter attributes, and have other effects, as explained here. Effects of activating remote_monitoring By enabling remote_monitoring, the integration becomes a different entity which is no longer attached to the infrastructure agent. As a result, the following items may be affected: Alert verification Enabling remote monitoring can affect your configured alerts in case they are using any of the values that are affected by this new feature. We strongly recommend checking your existing alerts to make sure they keep on working as expected. New entity attributes These attributes are modified in the resulting entity: Display name: New entity unique key (instead of using the display name) Entity GUID: New entity GUID Entity ID: New entity ID Entity key: New entity unique key (instead of using the display name) External key: Using integration entity name (instead of using the agent display) Changes in recorded metrics When remote monitoring is enabled, we will add the hostname and port values to all metrics. If the nricluster name or nriservice are defined in the integration configuration file, they will also be decorated. Unrecorded attributes Since the integration is now an independent entity which is not attached to the agent, the following agent attributes are not collected: agentName agentVersion coreCount criticalViolationCount fullHostname instanceType kernelVersion linuxDistribution entityType operatingSystem processorCount systemMemoryBytes warningViolationCount Your custom attributes Updated hostname For the ApacheSample, RedisSample, CassandraSample, and NginxSample integration metrics, we will use the integration configuration hostname instead of the short hostname from the agent. When the integration hostname is a loopback address, the agent will replace it in order to guarantee uniqueness.",
