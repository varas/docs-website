Adjust the data reported When evaluating security settings for a New Relic product, review the default events and attributes. The default attributes don't contain sensitive data. In general, it's simply the data needed for effective performance monitoring. Our products don't send other data unless you change the default security settings. Depending on your requirements, either or both of these situations may apply: If the default list contains data you're concerned about, you can disable those attributes from being collected. For how to edit that, see the documentation for the product you're using. If you need to send attributes not reported by default, you can enable those attributes to be reported. In that case, do not use high security mode: this will disable the ability to collect custom attributes.",

These metrics include duration information for the monitor, location of the monitor check, size of the request and response headers, the type of monitor, and a timestamp. Each time a synthetic monitor runs a check, details about the check are captured in theSyntheticCheck event type. SyntheticCheck events contain details specific to the check to provide visibility such as the status, type of monitor, and size of request and response headers. SyntheticRequest SyntheticRequest returns results from individual HTTP requests made during a check. The data gathered include job information, location, type of content for request, duration information, request size, and page load information. With each simple or scripted monitor check, we capture each individual HTTP request made during the check. The HTTP details are captured at a more granular level than the SyntheticCheck event type. SyntheticPrivateLocationStatus Every monitor check running on a private location triggers capacity details for that private location. These details are captured in a SyntheticPrivateLocationStatus event. This provides visibility into the capacity of a private location and whether additional minions are required to support the workload. SyntheticPrivateMinion If you have private locations, such as those inside your firewall, you can view information regarding those locations with the SyntheticPrivateMinion event.

      "body": "The Insights Dashboard API allows you to create and manage dashboards. Important Note that this API is deprecated. We have a migration guide to help you transition to using the new API. For instructions on using the UI, see Dashboards. Requirements If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Overview The Insights Dashboard API allows you to list, create, read, update, and delete new or existing dashboards. New Relic's API Explorer includes the cURL request format, available parameters, response status codes, and JSON response structure for available API calls. Example use cases The Insights Dashboard API is a flexible solution for many different use cases. Here are a few examples of how you can leverage the Dashboard API to solve problems: Automatically create dashboards for new teams or services pre-populated with standard organization metrics and charts. Use the API to view dashboard schemas, and save them in a central repository for source control and backups. Create widget and dashboard templates to allow teams to self-service. For detailed examples and use cases, see this New Relic blog post. Account and data security The Dashboard API includes safeguards to help ensure account and data security. Requirements Comments User key and permissions Required: This API requires a user key. You cannot use your account-level REST API key to manage dashboards. Cross-account widgets You can view cross-account widgets on a dashboard by using the Insights or New Relic One dashboards UI. However, the ability to view cross-account widgets when using the Dashboard API has these restrictions: To view the list of widgets on a specific dashboard with the Dashboard API, you must use the SHOW endpoint. To view a widget in the API payload, the widget's account ID must be the same as the account ID for the payload. If the account ID is not the same, the widget's details will not be listed. Instead, the widget's payload will show: \"visualization\": \"inaccessible\" Copy Use the API Explorer To view the Dashboard API options in the API Explorer: Log in to your New Relic account. Go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore. From the API Explorer's Select an account and key dropdown, select a user key. Select Dashboards, then select the API function. To use API functions with existing dashboards, include the dashboard id. To find the dashboard id, select the LIST endpoint, and apply filtering options. View Dashboard API video Follow along with this step-by-step tutorial to learn how to find your API keys, create new dashboards, view and update existing dashboards via the REST API. For a step-by-step guide to using the New Relic API Explorer to manage Insights dashboards, watch this video (approximately 6 minutes). Or, go directly to the full online course about New Relic APIs. Use API endpoints The API supports the following functions for Insights dashboards only. The API does not support these functions for data apps (collections of linked dashboards). API endpoints Comments CREATE POST /v2/dashboards Create a new dashboard. The API permits a maximum of 300 widgets when creating or updating a dashboard. Attempting to POST more than 300 widgets will produce an error. To add more widgets to the dashboard, use the Insights UI. UPDATE PUT /v2/dashboards/:id: Update an existing dashboard for the dashboard id. The API permits a maximum of 300 widgets when creating or updating a dashboard. Attempting to PUT more than 300 widgets will produce an error. To add more or edit existing widgets on the dashboard, use the Insights UI. SHOW GET /v2/dashboards/:id: View an existing dashboard and all accessible widgets for the dashboard id. To help ensure data security, the SHOW function returns only the dashboard widgets that the user has permission to view. If a dashboard includes widgets that the user is not authorized to view, the API will provide a placeholder with the visualization field set to inaccessible. LIST GET /v2/dashboards?page=:page:&per_page=:count: View a paginated list of dashboards. The list shows filterable dashboard metadata only; no widgets will appear in the list. Search options include: filter[title] as substring search filter[category] (all / favorites / mine} filter[created_after] as ISO date filter[created_before] as ISO date filter[updated_after] as ISO date filter[updated_before] as ISO date Sort options include: name recently_viewed last_edited If no sort option is provided, results will be ordered by id. Pagination options include the page and per_page fields. The per_page field controls the number of results per page with a default and maximum of 100 results. The response will include a pagination Link header, which provides next page and last page links. DELETE DELETE /v2/dashboards/:id: Delete an existing dashboard indicated by the dashboard id. Dashboard API schema JSON is the only supported format. When using API functions, be sure to add .json to the end of the request URL, as shown in the API Explorer. Important Widgets have a size limit of 3x3 (height and width may not exceed 3). Caution The Dashboard API 3-column restriction also applies to the dashboards you upload to New Relic One dashboards. If you update a dashboard with a different layout using the API, the uploaded dashboard will revert to the 3-column configuration.

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use New Relic APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "Our APM agents and mobile agents have limits on the number of events that can be reported. This document explains: Why event-reporting limits are necessary How sampling works How to work with and understand sampled data Difference between events and metrics This document is about limits on event data and how those limits lead to sampling. First, it may help you to understand the differences between these two types of data: Metrics: aggregated measurements over time. Examples: average response time over a one-minute time range, throughput over time, CPU utilization over time. Events: discrete events that happen at a specific moment in time. Examples: a log or error being reported, or a configuration change. Some events are aggregated over time to form metrics (for example: a count of errors over time). These two types of data have different uses: metrics are useful for recognizing patterns over time in your system, and events are useful for drilling down and getting detail about the causes of those patterns. Because metrics are aggregated over time, they’re useful for spotting trends and changes in system behavior. For metrics that represent an aggregated count of events (like an HTTP response time metric), the individual events give you granular detail about what happened, and let you facet by attributes that have high cardinality (like account or user ID). Why sampling of events is necessary Our APM agents and mobile agents have limits on how many events can be reported per harvest cycle. This is necessary because if there were no limit, a very large number of events being sent could have performance impacts on your application or on New Relic. When the limit is reached, the agents begin sampling events. Different agents have different limits, but the goal is to give a representative sample from across the harvest cycle. Also, agents may sample if they can't connect to New Relic. When an agent can’t connect to New Relic, it continues to store data locally. But it must restrict the size of the payload that is eventually sent. For this reason, it samples events during the disconnected period. The longer it is disconnected, the more it will sample. The impact of sampling One result of sampling is that there can be a discrepancy between unsampled metric data and sampled event data. Examples of this: An APM chart showing unsampled metric data may show you higher throughput than an equivalent NRQL query of sampled event data. For more about the difference between our metric timeslice data and event data, see Data types. A non-New Relic monitoring service may show different results from New Relic. Events that are capped and subject to sampling include: Transaction TransactionError Span (see Distributed tracing sampling) Custom events reported via agent API (example: the .NET agent's RecordCustomEvent) Mobile MobileRequest MobileCrash MobileHandledException Important For APM, you can compensate for sampling when querying data. Change how sampling occurs Before attempting to change how sampling occurs, please read these caveats and recommendations: Reporting more events will result in the agent using more memory. There will usually be a way for you to get the data you need without raising an agent's event-reporting limit. The payload size limit is 1MB (10^6 bytes) (compressed), so the number of events may still be affected by that limit. To determine if events are being dropped, see the agent log for a 413 HTTP status message. Here are some ways to impact sampling: Most agents have configuration options for changing the limit on sampled transactions (examples: Java agent’s max_samples_stored or the Android mobile agent’s setMaxEventPoolSize). If it’s important to you that a specific app activity not be sampled, you can use the Event API. You could deploy your application across a greater number of instances. Because the limits are per-agent, more agents will mean a larger event reservoir. APM: Compensate for sampling When querying APM-reported events, you can compensate for sampling by using EXTRAPOLATE. This will give you an approximation of what unsampled data looks like.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the Browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements To report data to Browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute Browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for Browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the Browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the Browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying Browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports Browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The Browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use Browser's SPA monitoring capabilities, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with Browser. In all cases, the Browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our SPA-enabled Browser agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend the Browser Pro agent. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, Browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the Browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The Browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

      "body": "Running the latest version of Browser monitoring ensures you can access all Browser features and enhancements. To update to the latest version, check your version number, then follow the steps to update an APM-managed installation or to upgrade a copy/paste installation. Check your version number To verify your Browser version number: View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet. Search the page source for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-. The numbers that follow nr- are your current version. For example, js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js indicates you are running version 593 of the Browser script. The Pro+SPA agent will have the format js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1184.min.js To verify the latest version of the Browser script loader: Go to js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js . Search for js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-, then note the numbers that follow nr-. If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your Browser agent. Check deployment method Your Browser agent may have been deployed using the copy/paste method rather than injected with APM. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console: > newrelic.info.sa Copy If the command returns 1, then your Browser agent used the copy/paste method. Update your APM-managed installation To update your APM-managed Browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet. To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to manually check and clear the cache. Update your copy/paste installation Use any of the following options to access the Browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace all of your existing snippet with the new version. If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version. If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process. Caution Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent. Retrieve the snippet from the UI Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. This option is only available for standalone installations. Extract the snippet with the REST API To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for viewing a specific Browser app. The loader_script attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet. This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your Browser app is linked to an APM app. Update using the loader endpoint To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, use the Browser Pro + SPA endpoint, the Browser Pro endpoint, or the Browser Lite endpoint. These endpoints always point to the latest version of the script snippet. Recommendation: Use the Browser Pro or Pro + SPA loaders regardless of your Browser subscription level. These loaders are compatible with both the Pro and Lite subscription levels. These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders: Find your Browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the New Relic UI or the REST API. Set your Browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet. NREUM.info = { applicationID: \"YOUR-APPLICATION-ID\", licenseKey: \"YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY\" }; Copy",

      "body": "Applications are automatically removed from New Relic after 93 days without sending data to our platform. You can also remove an application using the UI, once it has stopped sending data. Key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API, with the application name remaining reserved. For more information, see Inactive apps in New Relic One and our data retention guidelines. Before attempting to remove an app Before attempting to remove an APM, browser, or mobile app from the New Relic UI, keep in mind: You can downgrade your account to pay less or make it entirely free. To remove an app, you must have a user role with that capability. If an agent is still sending data from an app, you cannot remove an app. Remove an application from New Relic Before removing an APM, browser, or mobile application from New Relic, stop the application from sending data either by disabling the agent or by uninstalling it completely. APM applications Disable the APM agent: C SDK: Do a quick recompile and deploy. For example, surround your instrumentation in #ifdef, and set the value of YOURNAMESPACE_NEWRELIC_ENABLED with your build system. Go: Set Enabled to false. Java: Set agent_enabled to false. .NET: Set Newrelic.AgentEnabled to false. Node.js: Set agent_enabled to false. PHP: Remove or disable both the newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon components. Set newrelic.enabled to false. Python: Set monitor_mode to false. Ruby: Set agent_enabled to false. Restart the application server and wait up to ten minutes. Verify the color-coded health status for the app has turned to gray and is no longer reporting data. To remove the APM application and any browser applications linked to it, you have two options: Click the Delete application button on the APM application/service's Settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app/service) > Settings > Application. Or, call the /applications/delete endpoint of the New Relic REST API. For example: curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID.json' \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:YOUR_API_KEY' -i Copy Browser If you've used the copy/paste method to install the browser agent, remove the JavaScript snippet from your application's pages. After 93 days, the application will be removed from New Relic. Tip If browser data continues to be reported, see our suggestions below. Once your browser application has stopped reporting, you have two ways to remove it: If your browser application is linked to an APM application, deleting the APM application also removes the browser application. See the instructions for deleting an APM application/service above for details. Or, click the Delete application button on the browser application's Application settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings . Mobile Remove all references/dependencies to the New Relic's mobile SDK/frameworks, then rebuild the application. For more information, see the iOS and Android install docs. After 93 days, the application will be removed from New Relic. Or, once your mobile application has stopped reporting, you can also remove it manually: Click the Delete application button on the mobile application's Settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Application . Troubleshooting If you have problems removing an app, here are some possible causes and suggested solutions: You are not an admin on your full user account If you don't have proper permissions, you won't be able to remove an application. You have not waited long enough All app data must stop reporting to New Relic before you can remove that entity from New Relic. In most cases, this takes between 10-15 minutes. In rare cases, it can take a few minutes longer. Not all agents are disabled If you have multiple agents reporting data under the same UI name, then you must make sure you disable or uninstall all of the agents associated with that entity. You have problems removing your PHP app If you have a PHP app and aren't able to remove it from the UI, possible causes include: You have not disabled both components of the PHP agent. You must stop or uninstall both newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon in order to be able to remove a PHP app. For more information, see New Relic daemon processes. You have set up per-directory monitoring of your PHP app, and unexpected PHP data is reporting as the default PHP application in the New Relic UI. To fix this, change the default app name in the PHP agent config. You don't know where the app's data is coming from If you don't know where an app's data is coming from, it may be because the app's name has been changed. When an app name is changed in the UI, it does not change the underlying app name being reported; it only changes how the app name appears in the UI. To see if there is a difference between the reported name and the displayed name: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. Scroll down to Settings and select Application. Compare the name in the Application alias field to the name in the Your application still reports as message directly beneath it. To get host information about an app you are not familiar with: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. From the summary view, review the Servers list. Once you have identified where app data is coming from, you can remove the app from New Relic. Browser data is still reporting To remove an app from New Relic, all data must have stopped reporting, including browser monitoring data. To verify that you have disabled or uninstalled the APM agent associated with the app: Ensure that browser monitoring is disabled. If your browser monitoring script is inserted by the APM agent, turn it off from inside the UI, in the agent's config file, or in both. If you copied and pasted the monitoring JavaScript snippet in certain pages, remove that JavaScript snippet manually. Ensure all caches have been cleared that the application uses, such as host caches, CDNs, or anything else that caches built pages. Optional: To see a count of how many page views report from each domain, use this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView WHERE appName = 'YOUR_BROWSER_APP_NAME' FACET domain Copy If these steps don't resolve the issue, it is likely due to an end-user's browser cache that hasn't yet cleared. Wait until those caches clear. If your app has internal users, you may be able to identify the users and clear those caches. For more help",

      "body": "Exceptions can contribute to invalid application states, resulting not only in application crashes but also in negative user reviews. This may lead to users deleting your app, which in turn may affect your organization's profitability. With New Relic Mobile's Handled exceptions user interface, mobile development managers and their developer teams can identify significant factors affecting poor mobile app experience, and use filterable data to find a resolution more quickly. Features Handling exceptions as they occur can help improve your mobile app users' experience, but it's not enough to catch exceptions. You also need to know how to prevent them. For example: How many different types of handled exceptions are occurring? A high occurrence rate may necessitate changes to the back-end systems. Why does the user's app usage result in a try/catch? What is the context for the exceptions? When can a test environment's responses to handled exceptions indicate additional, more serious problems? What would have caused a crash if the exception had not been caught in production? What else (in the code or back-end API) is still affecting the users' experience? By using handled exceptions with New Relic Mobile, you can identify and resolve these kinds of issues more quickly. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: As you explore the wealth of data in the charts and table, use groups and filters to discover patterns that help you determine the root cause of mobile app exceptions. Handled exception features Comments Slice and dice your exception data. New Relic Mobile offers both an API and a user interface to explore the data most important to your business. Use the recordHandledException() method within a try{...} catch(){...} block to help understand how often your application is throwing exceptions, and under what conditions. Use groups and filters to analyze trends leading to the exception. For example, you can group by OS Build, then filter a specific appVersion. Understand a particular user's experience. Examine the percentage charts to see overall trends with users and sessions at a glance. Then, use custom attributes to focus on exceptions related to paid accounts than free accounts. Pinpoint when most exceptions occur. For example, group on Last Interaction to get an overall view of problems. To drill down further, use filters, such as: To examine exceptions caused by network problems, filter by carrier and then select wifi. To examine exceptions caused by app releases, filter by appVersion. Align issues with common characteristics. For example: Use groups and filters to determine whether handled exception trends appear in networks (ASN, carrier, location, etc.) or in devices (device model, manufacturer, operating system build, version, etc.). Explore recurring patterns in stack traces with the top five exception locations table. Query data and share your findings via New Relic Insights. Explore the event trail before and after a crash. With New Relic Mobile you get a more complete picture of events before and after crashes occur, so you can analyze and resolve problems from multiple angles: Use the handled exception's Occurrences page for expected exceptions. Use the Crash analysis UI and event trail for unanticipated exceptions. Requirements Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level and mobile data retention. Additional requirements include: Android: New Relic Mobile's Android agent version 5.15.0 or higher iOS: New Relic Mobile's iOS agent version 5.15.0 or higher Handled exceptions API and event type New Relic Mobile automatically includes default attributes that you can use to explore your handled exceptions data in New Relic Insights and get specific details: Use the recordHandledExceptions() method for the Android or iOS SDK API. Query the MobileHandledException event type in Insights. For more information, see the Insights examples for New Relic Mobile. You can also create your own custom attributes and events. Then, select attributes in Mobile's Handled exceptions page, and query or share them in Insights.",

      "body": "The Insights Dashboard API allows you to create and manage dashboards. Important Note that this API is deprecated. We have a migration guide to help you transition to using the new API. For instructions on using the UI, see Dashboards. Requirements If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Overview The Insights Dashboard API allows you to list, create, read, update, and delete new or existing dashboards. New Relic's API Explorer includes the cURL request format, available parameters, response status codes, and JSON response structure for available API calls. Example use cases The Insights Dashboard API is a flexible solution for many different use cases. Here are a few examples of how you can leverage the Dashboard API to solve problems: Automatically create dashboards for new teams or services pre-populated with standard organization metrics and charts. Use the API to view dashboard schemas, and save them in a central repository for source control and backups. Create widget and dashboard templates to allow teams to self-service. For detailed examples and use cases, see this New Relic blog post. Account and data security The Dashboard API includes safeguards to help ensure account and data security. Requirements Comments User key and permissions Required: This API requires a user key. You cannot use your account-level REST API key to manage dashboards. Cross-account widgets You can view cross-account widgets on a dashboard by using the Insights or New Relic One dashboards UI. However, the ability to view cross-account widgets when using the Dashboard API has these restrictions: To view the list of widgets on a specific dashboard with the Dashboard API, you must use the SHOW endpoint. To view a widget in the API payload, the widget's account ID must be the same as the account ID for the payload. If the account ID is not the same, the widget's details will not be listed. Instead, the widget's payload will show: \"visualization\": \"inaccessible\" Copy Use the API Explorer To view the Dashboard API options in the API Explorer: Log in to your New Relic account. Go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore. From the API Explorer's Select an account and key dropdown, select a user key. Select Dashboards, then select the API function. To use API functions with existing dashboards, include the dashboard id. To find the dashboard id, select the LIST endpoint, and apply filtering options. View Dashboard API video Follow along with this step-by-step tutorial to learn how to find your API keys, create new dashboards, view and update existing dashboards via the REST API. For a step-by-step guide to using the New Relic API Explorer to manage Insights dashboards, watch this video (approximately 6 minutes). Or, go directly to the full online course about New Relic APIs. Use API endpoints The API supports the following functions for Insights dashboards only. The API does not support these functions for data apps (collections of linked dashboards). API endpoints Comments CREATE POST /v2/dashboards Create a new dashboard. The API permits a maximum of 300 widgets when creating or updating a dashboard. Attempting to POST more than 300 widgets will produce an error. To add more widgets to the dashboard, use the Insights UI. UPDATE PUT /v2/dashboards/:id: Update an existing dashboard for the dashboard id. The API permits a maximum of 300 widgets when creating or updating a dashboard. Attempting to PUT more than 300 widgets will produce an error. To add more or edit existing widgets on the dashboard, use the Insights UI. SHOW GET /v2/dashboards/:id: View an existing dashboard and all accessible widgets for the dashboard id. To help ensure data security, the SHOW function returns only the dashboard widgets that the user has permission to view. If a dashboard includes widgets that the user is not authorized to view, the API will provide a placeholder with the visualization field set to inaccessible. LIST GET /v2/dashboards?page=:page:&per_page=:count: View a paginated list of dashboards. The list shows filterable dashboard metadata only; no widgets will appear in the list. Search options include: filter[title] as substring search filter[category] (all / favorites / mine} filter[created_after] as ISO date filter[created_before] as ISO date filter[updated_after] as ISO date filter[updated_before] as ISO date Sort options include: name recently_viewed last_edited If no sort option is provided, results will be ordered by id. Pagination options include the page and per_page fields. The per_page field controls the number of results per page with a default and maximum of 100 results. The response will include a pagination Link header, which provides next page and last page links. DELETE DELETE /v2/dashboards/:id: Delete an existing dashboard indicated by the dashboard id. Dashboard API schema JSON is the only supported format. When using API functions, be sure to add .json to the end of the request URL, as shown in the API Explorer. Important Widgets have a size limit of 3x3 (height and width may not exceed 3). Caution The Dashboard API 3-column restriction also applies to the dashboards you upload to New Relic One dashboards. If you update a dashboard with a different layout using the API, the uploaded dashboard will revert to the 3-column configuration.

Feature description When you take specific actions in synthetic monitoring like creating or editing a monitor, an NrAuditEvent is generated. This event includes details about the action taken and which user took that action. This data is stored for 13 months. This historical data may be helpful if you'd like to investigate how a problem with your account was created and who made that change. Synthetic monitoring's changes tracked include: Monitors Creation Edits (including location change, mute/unmute, and enable/disable) Script creation, edits, validation (including secure credentials used) Deletion Monitor downtimes Creation Edits Deletion Secure credentials Creation Edits Views Deletion Private locations Creation Edits (including clearing queues) Deletion For details on how to query this data, see Query details.

The synthetic monitoring specific examples in Audit query examples. Example use case: Finding changes made by a user Here's an example of using the synthetic monitoring audit log to solve a common problem: You are a manager at a company that uses synthetic monitoring. A new employee has been playing with your company's accounts to learn how synthetic monitoring works. Unfortunately, this employee was accidentally given full access to the production accounts, instead of the pre-production accounts. You want to determine what synthetic monitors this employee created, deleted, and updated, so that you will know which monitors need to be fixed. Instead of having to review every monitor in the account, you open the query builder and run the following NRQL query of the NrAuditEvent event: SELECT count(*) FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE actionIdentifier = 'synthetics_monitor.update_script' AND actorEmail = 'EMPLOYEE_EMAIL' FACET actionIdentifier, description SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy The query will return all the synthetic monitors that the employee has updated, deleted, created, disable, or muted.

      "body": "To view changes made in your New Relic account, you can query NrAuditEvent events. Available events and attributes The NrAuditEvent is created to record configuration changes made in our products. The data gathered for this event includes the type of account change, actor (user or API key) that made the change, a human-readable description of the action taken, and a timestamp for the change. To see all the attributes attached to this event, see NrAuditEvent. Example queries These examples show some of the ways you can run NRQL queries of the NrAuditEvent event. General account changes What changes have been made to the New Relic account? To view all changes to your New Relic account for a specific time frame, run this basic NRQL query: SELECT * from NrAuditEvent SINCE 1 day ago Copy What type of account change was made the most? To query what type of change to the account users was made the most frequently during a specific time frame, include the actionIdentifier attribute in your query. For example: SELECT count(*) AS Actions FROM NrAuditEvent FACET actionIdentifier SINCE 1 week ago Copy What trends appear in account changes? When you include TIMESERIES in a NRQL query, the results are shown as a line graph. For example: SELECT count(*) from NrAuditEvent TIMESERIES facet actionIdentifier since 1 week ago Copy What user management changes have been done? Note that your users' user model will impact these queries. If your users are on our original user model, you can only query per account. If your users are on the New Relic One user model, you should query the top-level account in your New Relic organization. To see all the changes made to users, you could use: SELECT * FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE targetType = 'user' SINCE this month Copy If you wanted to narrow that down to see changes to user type (full user vs basic user), you could use: SELECT * FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE targetType = 'user' AND actionIdentifier IN ('user.self_upgrade', 'user.change_type') SINCE this month Copy Synthetics: What changes have been made to a monitor? To query Synthetics monitor updates during a specific time frame, include the actionIdentifier attribute in your query. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE actionIdentifier = 'synthetics_monitor.update_script' FACET actionIdentifier, description, actorEmail SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy For more information about this Synthetics feature, see Synthetics audit log. Workloads: What changes were made to any workload configuration? To query what configuration changes were made to any workload, use the query below. The targetId attribute contains the GUID of the workload that was modified, which you can use for searches. Since changes on workloads are often automated, you might want to include the actorType attribute to know if the change was done directly by a user through the UI or through the API.

Feature description When you take specific actions in synthetic monitoring like creating or editing a monitor, an NrAuditEvent is generated. This event includes details about the action taken and which user took that action. This data is stored for 13 months. This historical data may be helpful if you'd like to investigate how a problem with your account was created and who made that change. Synthetic monitoring's changes tracked include: Monitors Creation Edits (including location change, mute/unmute, and enable/disable) Script creation, edits, validation (including secure credentials used) Deletion Monitor downtimes Creation Edits Deletion Secure credentials Creation Edits Views Deletion Private locations Creation Edits (including clearing queues) Deletion For details on how to query this data, see Query details.

The synthetic monitoring specific examples in Audit query examples. Example use case: Finding changes made by a user Here's an example of using the synthetic monitoring audit log to solve a common problem: You are a manager at a company that uses synthetic monitoring. A new employee has been playing with your company's accounts to learn how synthetic monitoring works. Unfortunately, this employee was accidentally given full access to the production accounts, instead of the pre-production accounts. You want to determine what synthetic monitors this employee created, deleted, and updated, so that you will know which monitors need to be fixed. Instead of having to review every monitor in the account, you open the query builder and run the following NRQL query of the NrAuditEvent event: SELECT count(*) FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE actionIdentifier = 'synthetics_monitor.update_script' AND actorEmail = 'EMPLOYEE_EMAIL' FACET actionIdentifier, description SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy The query will return all the synthetic monitors that the employee has updated, deleted, created, disable, or muted.

      "body": "The New Relic platform is built around the four fundamental telemetry data types we believe are necessary for complete and effective system monitoring: metrics, events, logs, and traces. Get started This doc will give you a fairly technical explanation of our core data types, their structure, and how they're used in our features. You can use most of our features without needing to understand the underlying data structure. But having a better understanding of this can help you get data into New Relic, understand the data you see in our UI, and query your data. For a simpler explanation of these data types using real-world examples, see Introduction to essential telemetry data types. Another good way to understand your data is to just start querying it. Tip Access your data easily on one.newrelic.com: Click the Browse data dropdown menu and select the data type (metrics, events, logs, and traces) you want to explore. Metrics First, we’ll explain the definition of metrics from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain how New Relic handles metrics. For a list of the metrics we collect, see our documentation on metrics. Metrics in the monitoring industry In the software monitoring industry, a metric means a numeric measurement of an application or system. Metrics are typically reported on a regular schedule. Two major types of metrics are: Aggregated data. For example: a count of events over one minute’s time, or the rate of some event per minute. A numeric status at a moment in time. For example: a CPU temperature reading, or a “CPU% used” status. Metrics are relatively easy to report and store because a single record can represent a range of time. They can also be aggregated more and more over time. For example, per-minute data may be “rolled up” to per-hour aggregations after some amount of time, and eventually may be rolled up to a per-day aggregation. This approach is efficient for long-term data storage. Metrics are a strong solution for storing data long-term, and understanding trends over time. One potential downside is that it can be difficult to do detailed analysis of older data that has been aggregated over time; when high detail is required about specific important actions, event data can be used. Metrics at New Relic Conceptually, \"metrics\" is a broad, general category. There are various ways New Relic measures and reports metrics but, in practice, when using the New Relic UI, you usually won't have to understand how exactly this happens. In our documentation, we typically will just refer to \"metrics,\" regardless of how that data is reported, unless there's a reason you need to know more (like understanding how to query your data). Here are some of the ways metrics are reported and stored across the New Relic platform: Dimensional metrics (used by Metric API and many integrations) In the monitoring industry, \"dimensional\" metrics refer to metric data that has a variety of attributes (dimensions) attached, such as duration-related attributes (start time, end time), entity ID, region, host, etc. This amount of detail allows for in-depth analysis and querying. At New Relic, this metric data is attached to the Metric data type and is sent from several sources: Some open-source integrations, like our Prometheus and OpenCensus exporters Our Telemetry SDKs Infrastructure services The Metric API (the underlying API used by the above tools) The events-to-metrics service To query this data and see its attributes (\"dimensions\"), you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Metric Copy As time passes, these metrics are increasingly aggregated into larger time buckets. This is done to optimize your ability to query data over a long period of time. For more details about the metric data type, see our docs. To learn how this data is ingested and stored, see the Metric API documentation. For tips on querying, see Metric query examples. Metric timeslice data (used by APM, Browser, Mobile) New Relic's APM, Browser, and Mobile report and display metrics in a simple data format that we refer to as metric timeslice data. A metric timeslice consists of three parts: a metric name, the segment of time the metric represents (the \"timeslice\"), and a numeric value (the measurement). For example: an APM metric timeslice for time spent in a particular transaction is named WebTransaction/URI/foo, and might have a response time of 0.793 for a one-minute time slice from 10:20am to 10:21am. These metrics usually follow a pattern like <category>/<class>/<method>. Our agents (APM, Browser, and Mobile) can collect thousands of metric timeslices per minute for a variety of performance metrics. For example: error rate, bandwidth usage, and garbage collection time. You also have the ability to create custom metrics. Metric timeslice data is a lightweight data type and lacks the detail that dimensional metrics have. Ways to explore and query metric timeslice data: For APM: metric timeslice data is converted to dimensional metrics and can be queried via NRQL Use the REST API If you want to learn more about the structure of metric timeslice data and see some examples, expand the collapser below. Metric timeslice examples Here are some common metric timeslice data examples, with a focus on common ones used by Ruby applications. ActiveMerchant New Relic tracks a variety of metrics on ActiveMerchant transactions which can be used for business analytics as well as performance monitoring. The metrics are summarized by operation as well as by gateway. regex sample metric legend name ActiveMerchant/. * ActiveMerchant/PayJunctionGateway ActiveMerchant/gateway/. * ActiveMerchant/gateway/PayJunctionGateway/purchase PayJunctionGateway ActiveMerchant/operation/. * ActiveMerchant/operation/purchase purchase For more information, see the ActiveMerchant website. ActiveRecord ActiveRecord is the Object-Relational Mapping API used by Ruby on Rails applications. The metrics shown here measure the performance of ActiveRecord's find and save methods. regex sample metric legend name ActiveRecord/. * /find ActiveRecord/User/find User#find ActiveRecord/. * /save ActiveRecord/Product/save Product#save For more information, see the API documentation for ActiveRecord. Apdex Apdex is a measure of user satisfaction with page load times. Controller In Ruby on Rails applications, HTTP requests are handled by Controller actions. A Rails application has many controllers, each of which has one or more actions. When your rails application receives an http request, that request is routed to the appropriate controller and action, based on the URL of that request. That action then does whatever processing is neccesary to generate an http response, which is most often a web page, but could also be a page fragment, an xml document, or any other kind of data that is requested by the client. The following metrics track the performance of controller actions, regardless of routing, and without taking into account any network or web server effects. regex sample metric legend name Controller/. * Controller/Users/show /Users/show Controller/. * /(?! \\ (other \\ )). * Controller/Users/show /Users/show Controller$ Controller All Controller Actions ControllerCPU/ ControllerCPU/Users/Show /Users/show For more information, see the API documentation for ActionController. Errors This metric tracks the number of errors or exceptions raised while processing requests. regex sample metric legend name Errors/all Errors/all External services External service instrumentation captures calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud and any other network calls. It does not include other first class back-end components such as MemCache and the database. In Ruby applications we instrument the Net::Http library to capture all HTTP services. regex sample metric legend name External/ [ ^/]+/all$ External/service.example.com/all All service.example.com calls External/ External/host.aws.com/Net::Http : :POST Net::Http : :POST [ host.aws.com] External/all$ External/all External Services External/ [ ^/]+/(?!all)/ External/service.example.com/all All service.example.com calls HTTP dispatcher This metric represents a summary of the throughput and response time of all web requests. regex sample metric legend name ^HttpDispatcher$ HttpDispatcher HttpDispatcher MemCache MemCache is a popular technology that enables applications to access shared memory provided by any number of physical machines as a global cache. Applications that heavily use the database often use MemCache for performance and scalability benefits. These metrics measure the frequency and response time of calls to MemCache to read and write data from the cache. Response times should be low (less than 5 ms) for a well performing MemCache deployment. regex sample metric legend name MemCache/. * MemCache/read MemCache read operations MemCache/read MemCache/read MemCache read operations MemCache/write MemCache/write MemCache write operations Mongrel This metric measures the length of the mongrel queue, which holds pending http requests to be processed by mongrel. The HTTP Activity graph overlays the maximimum queue length for a given period. The value is zero if mongrel is processing a request but has no other requests waiting in its queue. When looking at this value across an aggregate cluster of mongrels, the queue lengths of all mongrels is added together, showing the sum of all queue lengths. A mongrel queue length should be at or near zero; if it is consistently at a higher level, then it indicates that your rails application is having trouble keeping up with its load requirements. regex sample metric legend name Mongrel/Queue Length Mongrel/Queue Length Queue Length View ActionView is a package in Rails that is used to render the output that is the response to an http request, such as an html page or an xml document. The View is rendered by the controller that is handling the request. If View metrics represent a large portion of your controller's response time, it could mean you are doing a lot of database operations inside the view template itself. regex sample metric legend name View/. * View/Users/ _ child.html.erb/Partial Users/ _ child.html.erb View/. * /Partial View/Users/ _ child.html.erb/Partial Users/ _ child.html.erb View/. * /Rendering View/Users/show.html.erb/Rendering Users/show.html.erb For more information, see the API documentation for ActionView. Metrics attached to events (used by Infrastructure, other products) Because event-type data can have any type of key-value pair data attached to it, one way metrics can be reported is as attributes attached to an event. A couple examples of this at New Relic: Our infrastructure monitoring reports many metrics that are attached to events. For example, we report a ProcessSample event, which has various sample-based metrics attached to it, like CPU percentage. To learn more about infrastructure monitoring data, see Infrastructure data. In APM, the Transaction event has several metrics attached to it, including databaseDuration. To learn more about this data and how to query it, see Events. Metrics as a computation of events (used in some charts and queries) Metrics can be formed by counting New Relic events, or doing some other mathematical calculation on those events. For example, if you wanted to measure the total number of Transaction events over the last half hour, you might run this NRQL query: Select count(*) from Transaction since 30 minutes ago Copy Another example: if you wanted to compute the average response time for your service, you might run a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) SINCE 30 minutes ago Copy Some New Relic charts are generated with these kinds of queries. The downside of this approach is that there are limits on how many events a monitoring system (including ours) can report. This means that sometimes, for high-throughput systems, the count may not accurately represent the total activity on that system. To learn more about how this can be addressed, see Event limits and sampling. Want to report custom metrics? See Get data into New Relic. Event data First, we’ll explain the definition of events from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles event data. Events in the monitoring industry In the software industry, events can be thought of as simply “things that occur in a system.” For example, a server setting being changed would be an event. Another example: a website user clicking a mouse. Some events will generate a stored record, and that record is typically also called an event. Event data represents discrete occurrences and typically will have a high level of detail, so event data is suited for detailed analysis and querying. The downside to the use of event data is that there are typically so many events reported that it can become difficult to query that large dataset over longer time ranges. Events at New Relic At New Relic, we report events to data objects also called events. These events have multiple attributes (key-value pairs) attached. Event data is used in some UI charts and tables, and you can also query it. How long event data remains available is determined by data retention rules. One example of an event: APM reports an event type named Transaction, which represents a logical unit of work in an application. To see the attributes attached to this event, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Transaction Copy For examples of querying event data, see Introduction to NRQL. Other details about New Relic event data: Events can have any type of attributes attached. Some events have attributes that report metric data. You can report custom events. To increase the availability of your event data for querying/charting, you can turn events into metrics. Some systems generate a large number of events that exceeds collection limits and results in incomplete query results. For more on this, see Event sampling. Because event is a general term, in some New Relic contexts it will refer to any data type that can be queried via NRQL. For example, when you run a NRQL query, it returns a count of inspected events: this is a count of all data types queried. Log data First, we’ll explain the definition of logs from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles log reporting. Logs in the monitoring industry A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. Logs at New Relic New Relic's Logs gives you a centralized log management platform that connects your log data with other New Relic-monitored data. For example, you can see logs alongside your APM data. In New Relic, log data is reported with multiple attributes (key-value data) attached. To query your log data, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Log Copy To report custom log data, see the Log API. Trace data First, we’ll explain the definition of traces from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles tracing. Tracing in the monitoring industry In the application/infrastructure-monitoring world, tracing is a general term used to refer to various ways to report information about how a program or system is operating. For example, a stack trace provides in-depth information about a program’s subroutines. For large modern systems, which are often distributed across many services and micro-services, “tracing” often refers to distributed tracing, which is a way to monitor requests as they propagate through a complex, distributed environment. Tracing at New Relic New Relic offers a distributed tracing feature that tracks requests across a distributed system, and provides a dedicated UI for understanding and analyzing your traces. In New Relic, trace data is reported as Span objects, with multiple attributes (key-value pairs) attached. To query your tracing data, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Span Copy To learn more about how distributed tracing works, see Understand distributed tracing. To report custom distributed tracing data, see the Trace API.

If the number is in the common block, then the entire block will be dropped. If the number is in a metric data point, then the metric data point it resides in will be dropped. Payload size Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. Payload format The payload must encoded as UTF-8. Attribute naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). The following default limits apply only to data collected via the Prometheus Remote Write integration: Condition Limit Max unique Count and Summary timeseries (cardinality) per account per 5 minute interval See Additional account conditions. 1 million A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes. Timeseries received above this limit are dropped. This limit is enforced prior to and in addition to standard Metric limits. Additional account conditions Metric API limits apply at the individual account level. Trial and paid accounts receive a 1M DPM and 1M cardinality limit for trial purposes, but you can request up to 15M DPM and 15M cardinality for your account. To request changes to your metric rate limits, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Rate limit violations This section describes how the Metric API behaves when you exceed the rate limits, and how to respond if limits are exceeded. Max data points per minute (DPM) Data points per minute refers to the per minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the Metric API. When the maximum DPM limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Metric API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Max unique timeseries per account per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-account, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max unique timeseries per metric name per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-metric name, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max payloads per minute If you make more than 100k POST requests to the Metric API endpoint within a minute, the endpoint will return a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. In general, if you reach this limit, consider creating larger payloads. To do this, combine more data points into each request to reduce the number of POSTs that are necessary. If this is not an option, you can request a rate limit increase by contacting your New Relic account representative or visiting our Support portal. Restricted attributes These attributes are restricted by the New Relic platform. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point will cause the data point to be dropped, or the value to be omitted or overwritten: Attribute Description newrelic.source This resets to the value metricAPI. metricName This resets to the name value passed into each data point. This allows name to be an attribute key. endTimestamp timestamp and interval.ms will be converted to an endTimestamp for the data point. Additional restrictions include: Restriction Comments Metric and attribute names You cannot pass the same value for metric name and attribute name. In the following example, the metric is invalid because the metric is named service.errors.all and there is an attribute service.errors.all. Example: Metric value used as an attribute (invalid) [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\" , \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"service.errors.all\" : \"test\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Reserved words The Metric API inherits some reserved words from New Relic Insights, including accountID, appId, and eventType. Additionally, the syntax terms for NRQL are restricted unless you backtick (``) them. For a full list, see Reserved words: NRQL syntax terms. Keys within metric JSON All keys used within the metric JSON cannot be attribute keys. This includes interval.ms, timestamp, value, common, min, max, count, sum, and metrics. Exception: You can use name as an attribute key.",

      "body": "One type of New Relic data is metric timeslice data. There are several ways to query metric timeslice data: You can query APM metric timeslice data via NRQL (and therefore via our NerdGraph API). You can query any metric timeslice data via the REST API This doc explains how to do this with the REST API. Note that the API is not intended for bulk data extraction of minute-by-minute data points. Time based data All time values returned by the REST API and the API Explorer are UTC (Universal Time Coordinated). Be sure to adjust the time values for data collection as necessary. Time range considerations Important The minimum time range for data requests is one minute (60 seconds). Requests for anything less will result in a 422 status code and no data will be returned. New Relic only collects data at one minute intervals. The API uses the same mechanism for requesting data as the UI: it depends on the time range for the data you request. The objective is to optimize the number of data points returned and provide an easily digestible graph and report. For example: If you request data from a time range of three hours or less, the API returns the one-minute data values originally collected. If you increase the time range to greater than three hours, the data values returned will be an average for two minutes. If you increase the time range to over six hours, the data values returned will be an average for five minutes, and so on. Tip If the initial time for a requested time range is older than eight days, ten evenly spaced data points will be returned for any time range less than four days in length. Here is a summary of the metric value retrieval for the time ranges available. Between this time range... and this time range Granularity of collected data data age ≤ 8 days data age > 8 days ≤ 3 hours 1 minute 10 evenly spaced data points > 3 hour ≤ 6 hours 2 minutes > 6 hours ≤ 14 hours 5 minutes > 14 hours ≤ 24 hours 10 minutes > 1 day (24 hrs) ≤ 4 days (96 hrs) 30 minutes > 4 days ≤ 7 days 1 hour 1 hour > 7 days ≤ 3 weeks 3 hours 3 hours > 3 weeks ≤ 6 weeks 6 hours 6 hours > 6 weeks ≤ 9 weeks 12 hours 12 hours > 63 days 3 days 3 days When the start time for a requested time range is older than eight days, data has been aggregated or averaged to one hour periods due to the data aggregation schedule. This means that for any one hour period, only a single data value is available. Obtaining data at less than an hourly period in the time range would cause oversampling, resulting in duplicate values being returned. Returning only ten values prevents oversampling and presents a smoother chart, which eliminates a possibly misleading \"plateau\" effect. Controlling time period output Sometimes the output data's granularity may be too fine, or the time period for the data returned may be too short. To control this, include the period= parameter in the query command as the number of seconds you want each time period to report. Make sure your specifications follow New Relic's data aggregation schedules. Example #1: Following New Relic's table summarizing granularity of collected data, the following API call would normally return data in 30-minute periods, since the request is for 4 days (from=2018-02-13 and to=2018-02-17). By adding period=3600, the data will be returned as 60-minute periods. curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APPID/metrics/data.xml' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d'names[]=CPU/User+Time&from=2018-02-13T04:00:00+00:00&to=2018-02-17T04:00:00+00:00&period=3600' Copy You cannot specify a period smaller than the default for the time range you are requesting. For example: In the command example above, you can request 1-hour periods, since that is greater than the default (half hour) granularity for the time range. In the command example above, you cannot request 1-minute periods, since that is less than the default (half hour) granularity for the time range. Example #2: If you request a range > 7 days but ≤ 3 weeks, where the default period is 3 hours, you can specify periods such as 6, 12, or 24 hours. However, you cannot request 1-hour periods, because that is less than the default (3 hours). Data retention How long data is available depends on the data retention for specific types of data. Extracting non-existent metric timeslice data Situations may arise where non-existent metric names are requested. For example: The metric timeslice data has not been created for one application, but exists for another. When the same metric extraction query is used on both of these applications, it will not be located for one. The metric name was incorrectly specified. Important Metric values that have existed in the past, but are no longer collected, will return a zero value. A successful response will include a 200 status code and metadata about the request. The metadata will contain the names of the metrics requested and the status of the request for those names. Response Metadata Description Response Metric Data metrics_not_found Lists all metric names for which matching data was not found in the requested time period. Metric timeslice data will not be returned for these metrics metrics_found Lists all metric names for which matching data was found in the requested time period. Metric timeslice data will be returned for these metrics Here is an example of output for a valid metric name, HttpDispatcher.

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a New Relic APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. For more on faceting on multiple attributes, with some real-world examples, see this New Relic blog post. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. You can specify a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a time zone for the query but not for the results. The returned results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE 'z.*|q.*'' z-app q-app hostname RLIKE 'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Note: Slashes must be escaped in the Regex pattern. For example, \\d must be \\\\d. Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. If the Regex pattern contains a capture group, the group will be ignored. That is, the group will not be captured for use later in the query. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions Here is a listing of the available functions in NRQL. The definitions below contain example NRQL queries. Aggregator functions Use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data in a NRQL query. Some helpful information about using aggregator functions: See the New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. Cohort analysis functions appear on the New Relic Insights Cohort analysis page. The cohort functions aggregate transactions into time segments. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from complex metrics. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min gauge count, total, max, min, latest distribution count, total, max, min counter count Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "While there are various ways to create APM metric alert conditions, we recommend using NRQL because this provides additional controls, improved detection time, and consistency across all data types. In 2021, we made it easier to create NRQL alert conditions from charts and queries throughout New Relic One. See below an example of how to create an APM external service condition using NRQL. Setting up an APM metric condition is a two-part process: First, you need to identify the entity, then you create the NRQL condition. Identify the entity Here's how to get started: Go to one.newrelic.com, and click APM in the toolbar. Find the service you’d like to alert on. Click on the service. In the left navigation pane, click External services. Under Top 20 external services, find the service you want and click on it. On the right side of the page, where you see graphs for Response time and External calls per minute (throughput), decide which of these two options you would like to alert on. In the upper-right corner of the graph you choose, click the three dots, and select Create alert condition. Tip If you don’t see these three dots, ensure the Show new view option at the top of the page is enabled. This launches a modal with the NRQL alert condition builder, the query is pre-populated. If you choose response time, your query may look like this: If you choose external calls per minute, your query may look like this: With your query pre-populated in the condition builder, continue to the next section to create the NRQL alert condition. Create the NRQL alert condition In the modal, complete the following: Enter a condition name. In Define your signal, observe that any LIMIT, SINCE...AGO, and TIMESERIES clauses are removed so that the NRQL query syntax is valid. Tip If no results are returned, ensure you are in the correct account by looking at the current account in the upper-left of the modal. If it's not correct, you may need to close out of the modal and double-check that the correct account is selected in the account picker in the upper-left corner of the page. Fill out the remaining fields, select or create a policy near the bottom of the form, and save your condition. See our additional information about querying APM metric timeslice data with NRQL.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we're upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries, charts, and dashboards. With New Relic One, we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved features you get with New Relic One charts, dashboards, and queries Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Features You can scroll down to the transition details, but first here are some features we've added that show how New Relic One dashboards are a clear improvement over Insights dashboards. Improved query abilities With New Relic One, you get: Ability to query many accounts from the same widget: New Relic One lets you query across all your associated accounts in one place. Better querying and charting experiences: Query access is available globally, no matter where you are in New Relic One. This includes a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL. Improved query experience: You can query both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data. Easy customization: Every visualization now has the query accessible. You can augment any curated chart just by changing the NRQL query. Improved visualizations Not only can you select a wide range of visualization options, you can also add more to your dashboards: Better display options: Make your data easier to understand by using visualizations other than dense, line-heavy charts. New Relic One also offers a better TV mode. Facet linking: You can filter your dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. There's also support for cases. Learn more. More charts or widgets in an area: Insights restricted you to a 3-across limit. Now you can display up to 12 across your dashboard, providing increased data density along with improved tooltips and tracking across charts. Easier creation of multi-page dashboards: Insights referred to these as data apps. Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Chart consistency and flexibility: Dashboards include facet color consistency across widgets and faster loading times for more performant dashboards. Also, you can add any chart type to a dashboard in New Relic One! The New Relic Insights UI has served our users well for many years, but it's time to give you an even better experience. Join us and make the switch to New Relic One! Steps for a successful transition The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (April 12, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021). Insights functionality Transition to New Relic One UI We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of April 12, 2021, your old Insights web URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Data. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.) Mobile apps Your Insights mobile app is deprecated as of April 11, 2021. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app. tvOS apps and large displays New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time. Some New Relic customers with the original pricing model may have set up dashboards on wall screens for restricted users with kiosk mode. No action is required for you to continue to view these dashboards. APIs In July of 2021, the Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated and replaced with NerdGraph functionality. For more on this change, and tips on how to migrate, see NerdGraph API for dashboards. Partnership accounts This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customers’ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type. Questions If you have questions about the transition, please comment in our Explorers Hub post. Or, if you work with an account team, they will be happy to help you.",

      "body": "The second version of our StatsD integration was released on May 25 2020. It's an improvement on our first StatsD integration. Improvements include: simpler configuration, and a simpler method for adding tags (key-value pairs). Features Our StatsD integration (version 2) lets you easily get StatsD-format data into New Relic. You can also add any arbitrary tags (key-value pairs) to your data. Once your metrics are in New Relic, you can query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Requirements This integration uses our Metric API and our Event API to ingest data. To use these APIs, you'll need an Insert API key. The integration adheres to the Metric API requirements and data limits. The default rate limit is 100,000 data points per minute (DPM). If you think you're missing metrics or sending more than 100K DPM, see Request data changes. To see if your account is hitting the rate limit, run the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' FACET category, message LIMIT 100 since 1 day ago Copy Install This section will explain how to do a standard install. If you want to run StatsD in Kubernetes, see Kubernetes install. To install the StatsD integration, run the following command and include your New Relic account ID and New Relic Insert API key. This generates a TOML configuration file used by gostatsd. docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy If your account is in the EU data center region, add this to the above command: -e NR_EU_REGION=true \\ Copy After installing, you can: Do optional additional configuration Define your metrics Add custom tags to your data Create alerts Install for Kubernetes Here are examples of Kubernetes manifests for deployment and service objects: Kubernetes manifest examples Below are examples of Kubernetes manifests to deploy StatsD in a Kubernetes environment and create a StatsD service named newrelic-statsd. You need to insert your account ID and your license key. deployment.yml: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: selector: matchLabels: app: newrelic-statsd replicas: 2 revisionHistoryLimit: 2 template: metadata: labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: containers: - name: newrelic-statsd image: newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 env: - name: NR_ACCOUNT_ID value: \"NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID\" - name: NR_API_KEY value: \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy service.yml: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: newrelic-statsd port: 80 targetPort: 8125 protocol: UDP selector: app: newrelic-statsd Copy For configuration details, see Kubernetes configuration. Configure In the install procedure, you run nri-statsd with environment variables, and this generates a TOML configuration file. Additionally, you can set these configuration options: Configuration options Description expiry-interval string If a metric is not updated for this amount of time, we stop reporting that metric. Default is 5m. If you want to send the metrics only if the value was updated between the flush intervals, configure this to 1ms. To never expire metrics, set it to 0. percent-threshold list of integers Specifies the percentiles used for metrics aggregation. Default: 90. metrics-addr string Indicates address on which to listen for metrics. Default: :8125. Tip To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the StatsD integration you must define the following endpoints in the custom configuration: address = 'https://gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/ $NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' Copy address-metrics = 'https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' Copy Here are some examples of customizing configuration by overwriting the default configuration: Example of custom configuration # Specify after how long do we expire metrics, default:5m expiry-interval = '1ms' # percent-threshold specify a list of percentiles for metrics aggregation, default:90 percent-threshold = [90, 99] backends='newrelic' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy Disable timer sub-metrics: By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. If you want to disable those metrics you can do it by adding a disabled-sub-metrics configuration section and set true for the ones you want disabled. Here's an example: # disabled-sub-metrics configuration section allows disabling timer sub-metrics [disabled-sub-metrics] # Regular metrics count=false count-per-second=false mean=false median=false lower=false upper=false stddev=false sum=false sum-squares=false # Percentile metrics count-pct=false mean-pct=false sum-pct=false sum-squares-pct=false lower-pct=false upper-pct=false Copy Docker: overwrite default configuration To overwrite the default nri-statsd configuration while running in a container, you can mount a configuration file inside the container. You can adopt the following template as needed for your situation. Example: backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To run the container with the file mounted in the appropriate path: docker run \\ ... -v ${PWD}/nri-statsd.toml:/etc/opt/newrelic/nri-statsd.toml \\ ... newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Kubernetes: overwrite default configuration The best approach to configure nri-statsd running in Kubernetes is to use a configMap and mount the configMap into the container. (This is a similar process to mounting the configuration file in Docker.) Example: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-statsd-config namespace: default data: nri-statsd.toml: | backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = '$NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To use the configMap, declare a volume on your deployment spec template and then declare a volumeMount on your container spec. Example: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment spec: template: spec: containers: .... volumeMounts: - mountPath: /etc/opt/newrelic/ name: nri-statsd-config volumes: - name: nri-statsd-config configMap: name: nri-statsd-config Copy Metric format The integration receives metrics using the StatsD protocol. Optionally, the sample rate can be configured and tags can be added. Here's the metric data format we use: <metric name>:<value>|<type>|@<sample rate>|#<tags> Copy Here are explanations of these fields: Field name Description < metric name> string Required. Name of the metric. < value> string Required. The metric type: c = counter g = gauge ms = timer @ < sample rate> float Optional for simple counters or timer counters. When many metrics must be sent, you can use sampling to reduce network traffic. The downside is a reduction in the resolution of the data. An example of how this would work for sample rates below 1: If you set this to 0.1, the counter would send a measurement one out of every 10 times. # < tags> string Optional. Tags attached to your metrics are converted into attributes (key-value pairs). For more on tagging options, see Tags. Metric types Here are the types of metrics and how to format them: Counter A counter measures the number of occurrences of an event. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. A counter can be incremented or decremented during the same flush interval by adding a sign to the value. In the following example, the counter value will be 2: counter:4|c counter:-2|c Copy At each flush, the current count is sent and reset to 0. If the count is not updated, at the next flush it will send the value 0. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Here’s an example of a counter that is being sampled 1 out of 10 times: counter:4|c@0.1 Copy Gauge A gauge represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include temperature, CPU usage, and memory. Here's an example: temperature:40|g Copy If the gauge is not updated, at the next flush it will send the previous value. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Timer The timer metric type measures timing data. By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. These are sent as sub-metrics in the following format: <metric_base_name>.std_dev <metric_base_name>.median <metric_base_name>.summary <metric_base_name>.sum_squares <metric_base_name>.mean <metric_base_name>.per_second Copy The configured percentiles will generate the following metrics. The percentile threshold value will be attached as a tag. <metric_base_name>.sum_squares.percentiles <metric_base_name>.sum.percentiles <metric_base_name>.count.percentiles <metric_base_name>.upper.percentiles <metric_base_name>.mean.percentiles Copy The percentile threshold can be tweaked with the percent-threshold config option. These can be controlled through the disabled-sub-metrics configuration section. Add tags (attributes) You can add tags to your data, which we save as attributes (key-value pairs). There are two options for adding tags: Add default tags that apply to all metrics: These apply to all metrics. They are fixed and don't change over time. Add metric-level tags: These apply to specific metrics and allow the value to be changed between two submits. Add default tags that apply to all metrics Add tags to metrics and events by defining an environment variable in the startup command. Here's an example that would create two tags: -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" Copy Here's that environment variable used in the startup command: docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Add metric-level tags When defining the metric format, you can add tags using this format: <bucket name>:<value>|<type>|#<tags> Copy In this example, <tags> is a comma-separated list of tags. Tags format is: simple or key:value. Here's an example NRQL query that includes a custom tag: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE environment = 'production' Copy Create alerts You can alert on StatsD data using NRQL alert conditions. Alert example This procedure walks you through sending some sample data and then creating an alert condition using that data. First, send this data to New Relic’s StatsD container: echo \"prod.test.num:32|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Next, create a NRQL alert condition using this query: SELECT latest(prod.test.num) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'prod.test.num' Copy Here's an image showing creating this NRQL alert condition. Notice that the sample data sent in is represented by the blue dot on the upper right of the chart. Now we can create the alert condition with these settings: Remember to set the Condition name. If a metric with a value above 50 is sent, then an incident is created and notified. The incident is closed automatically after 24 hours. To test that the alert is working, run this command: echo \"prod.test.num:60|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Find and use data To query your data, you'd use any New Relic query option. For example, you might run a NRQL query like: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'myMetric' and environment = 'production' Copy For more on how to query the Metric data type, see Query metric data.

      "body": "You can generate metric-type data from other types of data in New Relic, including events, logs, and spans. Metrics are aggregates of your data and are optimal for analyzing and monitoring trends over long time periods. This document explains: Reasons to use this feature Available operations How to use our NerdGraph API tool to perform operations Why create metrics from other data types? Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage. This in turn allows you to query your data and build charts more easily. The difference between metrics and other types of data in New Relic is based on time. For more information, see Understand data types. Events, logs, spans: These types of data represent a single record at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. Metrics: These provide an aggregated view of your events, logs, or spans. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you can aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this information month over month. Why use metrics? Comments Flexibility Metrics are dimensional. You can choose what metadata (like host name or app name) is attached to them. Common metric measurements, like average, sum, minimum, and maximum, are already calculated. Data aggregation and retention The data has already been pre-aggregated into longer-period time buckets. Data retention is 13 months. Query capabilities You can query using the Metric data type. When you create metrics, this does not delete your events or other types of data. However, metrics are better for longer-range querying and charting. To get started converting your data to metrics, create a rule. Available operations To show, create, and delete rules for generating metrics from events, logs, or spans, use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading Intro to NerdGraph and exploring your data with the GraphiQL API tool. These operations fall under two basic request types: Mutations, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new metrics rule). Queries, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing metrics rules). All operations are role-based in NerdGraph as the currently logged-in New Relic user. Mutations Mutation operations for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics include: Create a rule See Create metrics. Delete a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the New Relic account ID. Example request: mutation { eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsDeleteRule The method being called to delete a rule. deletes This takes two parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Example response for the request: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsDeleteRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"id\": \"12\", \"name\": \"Test Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } Copy Enable or disable a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To enable or disable an existing rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics, use the same eventsToMetricsUpdateRule operation. The only difference is whether enabled is set to true or false. Example request to enable an existing metrics rule: mutation { eventsToMetricsUpdateRule(updates: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456, enabled: true}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsUpdateRule The method being called to update an existing rule and either enable it or disable it. updates This takes three required parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. enabled: To enable a disabled rule, set this to true. To disable a rule, set this to false. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Queries Query operations include: List all rules for a New Relic account You can list all rules in a New Relic account or return a specific rule. Example listing all rules for account 123456: query { actor { account(id:123456) { eventsToMetrics{ allRules{ rules{ id name enabled nrql description } } } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description query One of the basic API operation types. Used to query but not make changes. actor This specifies the current New Relic user. account(id: 123456) Specify the ID for the New Relic account where to retrieve data. eventsToMetrics Scope the data only for events-to-metrics, logs-to-metrics, or spans-to-metrics rules. allRules Returns all rules for that account. rules In the rules block, you can define what data you want returned. Available fields include: id name description nrql accountId enabled Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"allRules\": { \"rules\": [ { \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" }, { \"description\": \"Metric for duration\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"2\", \"name\": \"Duration Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy List rule by rule ID If you know the exact ID for a rule, then you can query for a specific rule. For example, you may have just created a rule and now you want to list its contents so you can review it. Example listing rule 36 for New Relic account 123456: query { actor { account(id: 123456) { eventsToMetrics { rulesById(ruleIds: \"36\") { rules { id name enabled nrql description accountId } } } } } } Copy For more details about the elements in this query, see List all rules. Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"rulesById\": { \"rules\": [ { \"accountId\": 123456, \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"36\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL API tool You can use our GraphiQL tool to explore the data structure. You can also use it to build and run the operations to convert events, logs, and spans to metrics. To use this tool: Create the metrics operation's request with the required parameters. Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql, and paste your query into the box. To execute the operation, press Play. Or, to get the cURL format, select Copy as cURL.) Validate the response in the response box. Optional: To verify that your rule-creation operation was performed successfully, run a list query for that rule ID.",

If the number is in the common block, then the entire block will be dropped. If the number is in a metric data point, then the metric data point it resides in will be dropped. Payload size Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. Payload format The payload must encoded as UTF-8. Attribute naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). The following default limits apply only to data collected via the Prometheus Remote Write integration: Condition Limit Max unique Count and Summary timeseries (cardinality) per account per 5 minute interval See Additional account conditions. 1 million A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes. Timeseries received above this limit are dropped. This limit is enforced prior to and in addition to standard Metric limits. Additional account conditions Metric API limits apply at the individual account level. Trial and paid accounts receive a 1M DPM and 1M cardinality limit for trial purposes, but you can request up to 15M DPM and 15M cardinality for your account. To request changes to your metric rate limits, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Rate limit violations This section describes how the Metric API behaves when you exceed the rate limits, and how to respond if limits are exceeded. Max data points per minute (DPM) Data points per minute refers to the per minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the Metric API. When the maximum DPM limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Metric API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Max unique timeseries per account per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-account, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max unique timeseries per metric name per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-metric name, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max payloads per minute If you make more than 100k POST requests to the Metric API endpoint within a minute, the endpoint will return a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. In general, if you reach this limit, consider creating larger payloads. To do this, combine more data points into each request to reduce the number of POSTs that are necessary. If this is not an option, you can request a rate limit increase by contacting your New Relic account representative or visiting our Support portal. Restricted attributes These attributes are restricted by the New Relic platform. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point will cause the data point to be dropped, or the value to be omitted or overwritten: Attribute Description newrelic.source This resets to the value metricAPI. metricName This resets to the name value passed into each data point. This allows name to be an attribute key. endTimestamp timestamp and interval.ms will be converted to an endTimestamp for the data point. Additional restrictions include: Restriction Comments Metric and attribute names You cannot pass the same value for metric name and attribute name. In the following example, the metric is invalid because the metric is named service.errors.all and there is an attribute service.errors.all. Example: Metric value used as an attribute (invalid) [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\" , \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"service.errors.all\" : \"test\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Reserved words The Metric API inherits some reserved words from New Relic Insights, including accountID, appId, and eventType. Additionally, the syntax terms for NRQL are restricted unless you backtick (``) them. For a full list, see Reserved words: NRQL syntax terms. Keys within metric JSON All keys used within the metric JSON cannot be attribute keys. This includes interval.ms, timestamp, value, common, min, max, count, sum, and metrics. Exception: You can use name as an attribute key.",

Maps automatically show your app's connections and dependencies, including applications, databases, hosts, servers, and out-of-process services. Tip In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. Service maps help you: Understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and communicate. Quickly see the current health and operational state of your entire environment. Troubleshoot operational issues and understand the impact of problems down to the host and instance level. Collaborate and drive shared understanding of an architecture. Access service maps Two options are available in New Relic One: the current service maps and the legacy APM service maps. To access the different service maps: Type To view maps Purpose Current service maps Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an entity) > Monitor > Service map Service maps give you increased access to all the entities across your accounts, and help you understand how your entire environment is connected. Legacy APM service maps Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps Legacy APM service maps let you create, customize, and share maps related to an individual app. Identify operational issues Service maps are color-coded to provide a quick look at the current status of your environment. Select nodes on a map to view additional performance metrics, and a full list and health check of each node's connections. The map automatically connects nodes into the map, so you can see which apps on the map connect to others. This helps you troubleshoot and assess the impact of a performance problem between a calling application and a specific database. With service maps, you can view your service and its status in the context of its up and downstream dependencies. Use maps in New Relic One to identify the root cause when troubleshooting an incident.

      "body": "Problem When using service maps, you can't view the full set of entities or the relationships between entities that you expect to see. Solution Make sure that the entities are being monitored with an agent. If you have a mix of agents with some having distributed tracing turned on and some having it turned off, you will not see the relations between those agents. The solution for this scenario is to run all agents either with distributed tracing turned on (preferred) or turn it off for all agents. If this does not remedy the issue, the service you're trying to view may require manual instrumentation. When you view applications and services that we automatically instrument in service maps, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some of these services or applications are missing from service maps. Tip Some browser apps are exceptions to this, and may be missing because: Relationships for copy and paste browser agents are not detected. Only the relationships for injected browser agents is shown (the app the agent is injected into). Call relationships (for example, AJAX calling to other apps) are not displayed. If services or apps are missing, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application.",

      "body": "Here is information about using the legacy APM service maps feature to create, customize, and use service maps. For help using the current service maps feature, see How to use service maps. Requirements The legacy service map features in APM depend on your New Relic agent version: Feature Requirements App visibility For your app to appear in service maps, one of the following must be true: Your app must have the minimum agent version required for distributed tracing and have distributed tracing enabled. Note: New Relic Mobile apps do not yet support distributed tracing and will not show relationships to applications that have distributed tracing enabled. Your app must have the minimum APM agent version required for cross app tracing and have cross app tracing enabled. Host and instance visibility To view specific hosts, instances, and types of database information, your agent must meet the same minimum agent versions as the APM database and instance feature and use any of the compatible database drivers. Database-only visibility APM's service maps feature includes the ability to opt out of the deeper, host and instance level view. However, to view databases in service maps without the instance-level details, you must still meet the same minimum agent versions as the Database and slow queries features. Create maps The APM service maps feature helps you create your first map by providing default map or architecture suggestions that automatically build a default map (if you have more than ten reporting apps). To view these suggested maps, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service Maps > Suggested maps. To create a new map: Do one of the following: Start from scratch: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Create new map . Copy an existing map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > Save as new. Name your map. Rearrange, group, or add nodes on the map as needed. Important Previously, you could have private service maps. Now, all users can view, edit, and delete all existing or new service maps in the account. Save and rename maps Here are some tips about saving and renaming maps: Save To save changes to a map, select Save. To create a copy of the current map, select Save as new. Rename To rename a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the pencil icon next to the map name. Change the name, then select Save. Add or remove nodes on maps After you create or save a map, build out your map by adding nodes to it. Nodes are added to the map differently based on the node type. To remove any node from the map, mouse over the node, then select the remove X icon. Applications, Mobile apps, plugins Nodes for applications, mobile apps, and plugins (including databases) need to be added to the map in order to add any other nodes. Nodes are added and connected into the map as you select them. The check mark icon means that node is already on the map. To add New Relic monitored apps or plugins to maps: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. Select any applications from the App/Service list. Rearrange or group together as needed. Browser, databases, external services, connected apps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. To add Browser apps, databases, external services, or other connected apps to the map: Select an incoming or outgoing connection widget. From the list of connections, mouse over an app or service, then select the plus icon. Rearrange as needed. Custom nodes To add a custom node to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. From the App/Service list, select Create custom node. Name the node. Add connections: Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. Then select the plus icon on your target node. Select Save. Rearrange as needed. To add or remove custom node connections: Mouse over the custom node and select the pencil icon. Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. To add a connection, select the plus icon. To remove a connection, select the minus icon. Select Save. Move around the map Move around the map by panning or zooming in and out. If you want to... Do this... Pan the map In pan mode, click and drag. In drag-select mode, hold the Alt key, then click and drag. Zoom in and out In either mode, zoom in and out by scrolling the mouse wheel. View your entire map in traffic light mode Zoom out until node details fade out and are replaced by health status colors. Toggle the traffic light view on and off Select Views, then select Traffic light mode. View all the nodes and their dependencies Select Discover your environment. Drill down into more detail from a node Use standard UI functions. Select, arrange, group nodes Click on a node to select it and view its performance summary. You can also select multiple nodes at once, to group and ungroup them: Select nodes To select one node, click on the node. To select multiple nodes: Click the drag-select icon to switch to drag-select mode. Click and drag the mouse to draw a square around the nodes you want to select. OR Hold the Shift key and click on each node you want to select. Arrange nodes Caution Auto-arrange cannot be undone. Consider saving a copy of your map first. To arrange nodes on the map, select one or more node, then drag to a snap point on the map. To automatically organize all your nodes and connections, select Auto-arrange map. Group and ungroup nodes If you want to... Do this... Group nodes together on the map Select two or more nodes, then select Create group. Name your new group Mouse over the group, then select the pencil icon. Rename an existing group Select the pencil icon. Remove nodes from a group Select the group, then select the minus icon for each item you want to remove. Delete maps To delete a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the map name's pencil icon. Select Delete map. Identify issues with external services If your app connects to an external service that New Relic does not monitor (for example, a third-party API), New Relic watches the service for a week in order to baseline its response time. If New Relic can collect a statistically significant number of data points (more than 100), New Relic compares the current response time to this baseline and uses this to set the health status indicator: Green: Response time from the service is less than 1.75 times the baseline. Yellow: Response time from the service is longer than 1.75 times the baseline. Red: Response time from the service is longer than 2.5 times the baseline. Gray: Alerts concluded it does not have enough data to determine the health status. Purple: Alerts cannot yet conclude if it has enough data to determine the health status. Visualize and monitor complex architectures Use service maps to visualize and monitor complex architectures. For a tutorial introducing the latest features, select the service map's question question-circle icon. Nodes Nodes are the basic building blocks for your map. You can add a variety of node types including: Node type Description New Relic APM-monitored app Add your app to the map to view their connections to databases, Browser apps, out-of-process services, and other instrumented apps. (In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are also referred to as web external or background external data.) New Relic Browser apps Automatically detected for each app and added via the incoming connections widget. Only displays Browser apps linked to an APM app (standalone browser apps are not supported). New Relic Mobile apps Automatically detected and added via the app/service list panel. Plugins, including Databases Automatically detected for each app and added via the connections widget. Databases in service maps require the same agent versions as the new Database page features. External services Service maps automatically detects external services (visible in the connections widget), to track your app's external dependencies and monitor the health of those connections. Custom nodes Add custom nodes via the app/service list panel to include apps and services not automatically instrumented by New Relic (for example, load balancers, implementation planning, and so on). Group nodes A group node contains multiple other nodes. For apps, group nodes include a summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. Node arrangement and grouping Click and drag a node to move it around the map, for a customizable view of your architecture. App nodes can also be grouped together into a single node to better organize related apps and services. Grouped nodes include summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. To remove items from a group, mouse over the group and select the pencil pencil icon, then select the minus minus-circle icon to remove the item from the group. Incoming and outgoing connections Service maps automatically detects incoming and outgoing connections based on HTTP calls between entities. Mouse over a node to highlight the node's connections. Widgets at the end of each node display a count of that node's connections, and you can click on those widgets to add related entities to the map: View performance summary Click on an app to view its performance over the last 30 minutes. The chart defaults to Response time, but you can view other metrics by selecting any of the available Apdex, Throughput, or Error rate links. While charts use the last 30 minutes of performance data, the service map as a whole is based on the last five minutes. View the app in APM or Browser and view its labels by selecting the overflow ellipsis-v icon. Click the app name again to hide the summary charts, and select the overflow ellipsis-h icon again to hide other details. Map list and app/service list panels Select the Map list panel to: Search for and view your maps, and access other users' shared maps. Create a new map. Select the App/Service List panel to: Add new apps, mobile apps, and plugins to your map. Create custom nodes and add them to the map. Health status and performance metrics You can see health status indicators for most nodes. Except for out-of-process services (external services or background services), entities use the health status indicators used by New Relic Alerts. For out-of-process (external) services, the health status indicator measures the health of the connection to the external service. View all connected apps and services The Discover your environment feature allows you to view all of your apps, services, and dependencies together with a single click. This feature detects all connected applications and services (including externals and databases) to give you a comprehensive view of your overall software architecture environment. To view all connected apps and services: In APM, select Service maps. From your Map list, select Discover your environment to display all of your nodes. Hover over any node to view its dependencies and how it connects to other parts of your service map. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view their details. The Discover your environment feature may not be available if you are using an older New Relic agent version. See Troubleshooting cross application tracing for version information. This feature may also not be available for highly complex service maps with many elements. Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Discover your environment: Use this option to view all of your nodes and their dependencies in one place. Traffic light mode Traffic light mode lets you view the health status of your entire architecture at a glance. This feature helps you quickly find service and app problems, even within a complex environment with many nodes. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Traffic light mode. When traffic lights mode is On, zooming out far enough on a service map eventually causes the nodes to switch from displaying textual information, to only health status colors. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view more details. Traffic light mode is on by default. When traffic lights mode is Off, service map nodes retain their textual information and do not switch to health status colors, No matter how far you zoom out. one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Views > Traffic light mode: When traffic light mode is enabled, zooming out of your service map displays nodes in health status colors. Midnight mode Midnight mode inverts the screen's colors, going from a white background to a dark background. Midnight mode reduces eye strain, especially in low light environments. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Midnight mode.",

      "body": "Here is information about how to use the current service maps feature. For help using the earlier service maps feature, see Legacy APM service maps. Service maps helps you visualize dependencies quickly and easily across your environment. They help you see how all your entities work together across your system. You can use service maps to troubleshoot problems, see how your environment works together, and ensure that issues don’t have downstream repercussions. Service maps also supports cross-account access so help you see relationships between entities for all your accounts. Requirements Service maps work with distributed tracing to connect relationships between entities. Service maps are still functional if you have not enabled distributed tracing, but we recommend having distributed tracing enabled for all agents. This ensures a more consistent experience while using service maps. For best results, update existing agents to the latest version. The required minimum agent versions for maps are: Minimum versions when distributed tracing is enabled The required minimum agent versions for maps using distributed tracing are: C SDK 1.1.0 or higher Go agent 2.1.0 or higher Java agent 4.3.0 or higher .NET agent 8.6.45.0 or higher Node.js agent 4.7.0 or higher PHP agent 8.4 or higher Python agent 4.2.0.100 or higher Ruby agent 5.3.0.346 or higher Minimum versions when distributed tracing is NOT enabled The minimum version requirements for maps not using distributed tracing are: C SDK: not available Go 1.11 or higher Java 3.9.0 or higher .NET 4.2 or higher Node.js 2.0.0 or higher PHP 4.19.0 or higher Python 2.38.0.31 or higher Ruby 4.3.0 or higher Add or remove connections to an entity To view service maps, from one.newrelic.com click Explorer. Once you select an entity to view, you can select service maps from the sidebar. The map shows your upstream and downstream services: entities toward the left are upstream, entities toward the right are downstream. To add or remove connections to an entity: Hover over the entity in the map that you want to alter. Click add or remove more connections. In the connection list, keep boxes checked for the entities that you want to appear in the map. Unchecked entities will be removed from the map. Color coded for alerts Each entity in a map displays a color dependent on its performance. Green: there are currently no violations for this entities performance. Yellow: there is an open warning violation for this entity. Red: there is an open critical violation for this entity. Gray: no alert conditions have been set for the entity White: agent not reporting. This means that the agent installed on the entity is not reporting any data. This is expected behavior for databases or externals. Add maps and charts to dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: adding a service map to a dashboard provides context for the data being reported and where it's coming from. You can add any service map to a dashboard. For example, if you have a dashboard showcasing performance metrics for several entities, adding a service map to the dashboard shows how all the entities are related and provides additional context about your system. To add a service map to a dashboard: Go to one.newrelic.com and select the Explorer. Select an entity from the index. Click on Service map. Click Add to dashboard. Search for the dashboard you want to add the map to. Understand dependencies using API You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with NerdGraph. For more information and examples, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL relationships API tutorial. Externals and databases in maps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types: Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, externals are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported. Databases are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only see the service call is reported to New Relic. Missing nodes If you are unable to view certain entities in New Relic One service maps, see Troubleshooting: Missing or obfuscated data in New Relic One.",

      "body": "Problem When using service maps, you can't view the full set of entities or the relationships between entities that you expect to see. Solution Make sure that the entities are being monitored with an agent. If you have a mix of agents with some having distributed tracing turned on and some having it turned off, you will not see the relations between those agents. The solution for this scenario is to run all agents either with distributed tracing turned on (preferred) or turn it off for all agents. If this does not remedy the issue, the service you're trying to view may require manual instrumentation. When you view applications and services that we automatically instrument in service maps, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some of these services or applications are missing from service maps. Tip Some browser apps are exceptions to this, and may be missing because: Relationships for copy and paste browser agents are not detected. Only the relationships for injected browser agents is shown (the app the agent is injected into). Call relationships (for example, AJAX calling to other apps) are not displayed. If services or apps are missing, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application.",

      "body": "Here is information about using the legacy APM service maps feature to create, customize, and use service maps. For help using the current service maps feature, see How to use service maps. Requirements The legacy service map features in APM depend on your New Relic agent version: Feature Requirements App visibility For your app to appear in service maps, one of the following must be true: Your app must have the minimum agent version required for distributed tracing and have distributed tracing enabled. Note: New Relic Mobile apps do not yet support distributed tracing and will not show relationships to applications that have distributed tracing enabled. Your app must have the minimum APM agent version required for cross app tracing and have cross app tracing enabled. Host and instance visibility To view specific hosts, instances, and types of database information, your agent must meet the same minimum agent versions as the APM database and instance feature and use any of the compatible database drivers. Database-only visibility APM's service maps feature includes the ability to opt out of the deeper, host and instance level view. However, to view databases in service maps without the instance-level details, you must still meet the same minimum agent versions as the Database and slow queries features. Create maps The APM service maps feature helps you create your first map by providing default map or architecture suggestions that automatically build a default map (if you have more than ten reporting apps). To view these suggested maps, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service Maps > Suggested maps. To create a new map: Do one of the following: Start from scratch: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Create new map . Copy an existing map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > Save as new. Name your map. Rearrange, group, or add nodes on the map as needed. Important Previously, you could have private service maps. Now, all users can view, edit, and delete all existing or new service maps in the account. Save and rename maps Here are some tips about saving and renaming maps: Save To save changes to a map, select Save. To create a copy of the current map, select Save as new. Rename To rename a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the pencil icon next to the map name. Change the name, then select Save. Add or remove nodes on maps After you create or save a map, build out your map by adding nodes to it. Nodes are added to the map differently based on the node type. To remove any node from the map, mouse over the node, then select the remove X icon. Applications, Mobile apps, plugins Nodes for applications, mobile apps, and plugins (including databases) need to be added to the map in order to add any other nodes. Nodes are added and connected into the map as you select them. The check mark icon means that node is already on the map. To add New Relic monitored apps or plugins to maps: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. Select any applications from the App/Service list. Rearrange or group together as needed. Browser, databases, external services, connected apps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. To add Browser apps, databases, external services, or other connected apps to the map: Select an incoming or outgoing connection widget. From the list of connections, mouse over an app or service, then select the plus icon. Rearrange as needed. Custom nodes To add a custom node to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. From the App/Service list, select Create custom node. Name the node. Add connections: Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. Then select the plus icon on your target node. Select Save. Rearrange as needed. To add or remove custom node connections: Mouse over the custom node and select the pencil icon. Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. To add a connection, select the plus icon. To remove a connection, select the minus icon. Select Save. Move around the map Move around the map by panning or zooming in and out. If you want to... Do this... Pan the map In pan mode, click and drag. In drag-select mode, hold the Alt key, then click and drag. Zoom in and out In either mode, zoom in and out by scrolling the mouse wheel. View your entire map in traffic light mode Zoom out until node details fade out and are replaced by health status colors. Toggle the traffic light view on and off Select Views, then select Traffic light mode. View all the nodes and their dependencies Select Discover your environment. Drill down into more detail from a node Use standard UI functions. Select, arrange, group nodes Click on a node to select it and view its performance summary. You can also select multiple nodes at once, to group and ungroup them: Select nodes To select one node, click on the node. To select multiple nodes: Click the drag-select icon to switch to drag-select mode. Click and drag the mouse to draw a square around the nodes you want to select. OR Hold the Shift key and click on each node you want to select. Arrange nodes Caution Auto-arrange cannot be undone. Consider saving a copy of your map first. To arrange nodes on the map, select one or more node, then drag to a snap point on the map. To automatically organize all your nodes and connections, select Auto-arrange map. Group and ungroup nodes If you want to... Do this... Group nodes together on the map Select two or more nodes, then select Create group. Name your new group Mouse over the group, then select the pencil icon. Rename an existing group Select the pencil icon. Remove nodes from a group Select the group, then select the minus icon for each item you want to remove. Delete maps To delete a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the map name's pencil icon. Select Delete map. Identify issues with external services If your app connects to an external service that New Relic does not monitor (for example, a third-party API), New Relic watches the service for a week in order to baseline its response time. If New Relic can collect a statistically significant number of data points (more than 100), New Relic compares the current response time to this baseline and uses this to set the health status indicator: Green: Response time from the service is less than 1.75 times the baseline. Yellow: Response time from the service is longer than 1.75 times the baseline. Red: Response time from the service is longer than 2.5 times the baseline. Gray: Alerts concluded it does not have enough data to determine the health status. Purple: Alerts cannot yet conclude if it has enough data to determine the health status. Visualize and monitor complex architectures Use service maps to visualize and monitor complex architectures. For a tutorial introducing the latest features, select the service map's question question-circle icon. Nodes Nodes are the basic building blocks for your map. You can add a variety of node types including: Node type Description New Relic APM-monitored app Add your app to the map to view their connections to databases, Browser apps, out-of-process services, and other instrumented apps. (In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are also referred to as web external or background external data.) New Relic Browser apps Automatically detected for each app and added via the incoming connections widget. Only displays Browser apps linked to an APM app (standalone browser apps are not supported). New Relic Mobile apps Automatically detected and added via the app/service list panel. Plugins, including Databases Automatically detected for each app and added via the connections widget. Databases in service maps require the same agent versions as the new Database page features. External services Service maps automatically detects external services (visible in the connections widget), to track your app's external dependencies and monitor the health of those connections. Custom nodes Add custom nodes via the app/service list panel to include apps and services not automatically instrumented by New Relic (for example, load balancers, implementation planning, and so on). Group nodes A group node contains multiple other nodes. For apps, group nodes include a summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. Node arrangement and grouping Click and drag a node to move it around the map, for a customizable view of your architecture. App nodes can also be grouped together into a single node to better organize related apps and services. Grouped nodes include summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. To remove items from a group, mouse over the group and select the pencil pencil icon, then select the minus minus-circle icon to remove the item from the group. Incoming and outgoing connections Service maps automatically detects incoming and outgoing connections based on HTTP calls between entities. Mouse over a node to highlight the node's connections. Widgets at the end of each node display a count of that node's connections, and you can click on those widgets to add related entities to the map: View performance summary Click on an app to view its performance over the last 30 minutes. The chart defaults to Response time, but you can view other metrics by selecting any of the available Apdex, Throughput, or Error rate links. While charts use the last 30 minutes of performance data, the service map as a whole is based on the last five minutes. View the app in APM or Browser and view its labels by selecting the overflow ellipsis-v icon. Click the app name again to hide the summary charts, and select the overflow ellipsis-h icon again to hide other details. Map list and app/service list panels Select the Map list panel to: Search for and view your maps, and access other users' shared maps. Create a new map. Select the App/Service List panel to: Add new apps, mobile apps, and plugins to your map. Create custom nodes and add them to the map. Health status and performance metrics You can see health status indicators for most nodes. Except for out-of-process services (external services or background services), entities use the health status indicators used by New Relic Alerts. For out-of-process (external) services, the health status indicator measures the health of the connection to the external service. View all connected apps and services The Discover your environment feature allows you to view all of your apps, services, and dependencies together with a single click. This feature detects all connected applications and services (including externals and databases) to give you a comprehensive view of your overall software architecture environment. To view all connected apps and services: In APM, select Service maps. From your Map list, select Discover your environment to display all of your nodes. Hover over any node to view its dependencies and how it connects to other parts of your service map. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view their details. The Discover your environment feature may not be available if you are using an older New Relic agent version. See Troubleshooting cross application tracing for version information. This feature may also not be available for highly complex service maps with many elements. Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Discover your environment: Use this option to view all of your nodes and their dependencies in one place. Traffic light mode Traffic light mode lets you view the health status of your entire architecture at a glance. This feature helps you quickly find service and app problems, even within a complex environment with many nodes. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Traffic light mode. When traffic lights mode is On, zooming out far enough on a service map eventually causes the nodes to switch from displaying textual information, to only health status colors. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view more details. Traffic light mode is on by default. When traffic lights mode is Off, service map nodes retain their textual information and do not switch to health status colors, No matter how far you zoom out. one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Views > Traffic light mode: When traffic light mode is enabled, zooming out of your service map displays nodes in health status colors. Midnight mode Midnight mode inverts the screen's colors, going from a white background to a dark background. Midnight mode reduces eye strain, especially in low light environments. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Midnight mode.",

Maps automatically show your app's connections and dependencies, including applications, databases, hosts, servers, and out-of-process services. Tip In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. Service maps help you: Understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and communicate. Quickly see the current health and operational state of your entire environment. Troubleshoot operational issues and understand the impact of problems down to the host and instance level. Collaborate and drive shared understanding of an architecture. Access service maps Two options are available in New Relic One: the current service maps and the legacy APM service maps. To access the different service maps: Type To view maps Purpose Current service maps Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an entity) > Monitor > Service map Service maps give you increased access to all the entities across your accounts, and help you understand how your entire environment is connected. Legacy APM service maps Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps Legacy APM service maps let you create, customize, and share maps related to an individual app. Identify operational issues Service maps are color-coded to provide a quick look at the current status of your environment. Select nodes on a map to view additional performance metrics, and a full list and health check of each node's connections. The map automatically connects nodes into the map, so you can see which apps on the map connect to others.

Service maps helps you visualize dependencies quickly and easily across your environment. They help you see how all your entities work together across your system. You can use service maps to troubleshoot problems, see how your environment works together, and ensure that issues don’t have downstream repercussions. Service maps also supports cross-account access so help you see relationships between entities for all your accounts. Requirements Service maps work with distributed tracing to connect relationships between entities. Service maps are still functional if you have not enabled distributed tracing, but we recommend having distributed tracing enabled for all agents. This ensures a more consistent experience while using service maps. For best results, update existing agents to the latest version. The required minimum agent versions for maps are: Minimum versions when distributed tracing is enabled The required minimum agent versions for maps using distributed tracing are: C SDK 1.1.0 or higher Go agent 2.1.0 or higher Java agent 4.3.0 or higher .NET agent 8.6.45.0 or higher Node.js agent 4.7.0 or higher PHP agent 8.4 or higher Python agent 4.2.0.100 or higher Ruby agent 5.3.0.346 or higher Minimum versions when distributed tracing is NOT enabled The minimum version requirements for maps not using distributed tracing are: C SDK: not available Go 1.11 or higher Java 3.9.0 or higher .NET 4.2 or higher Node.js 2.0.0 or higher PHP 4.19.0 or higher Python 2.38.0.31 or higher Ruby 4.3.0 or higher Add or remove connections to an entity To view service maps, from one.newrelic.com click Explorer. Once you select an entity to view, you can select service maps from the sidebar. The map shows your upstream and downstream services: entities toward the left are upstream, entities toward the right are downstream. To add or remove connections to an entity: Hover over the entity in the map that you want to alter. Click add or remove more connections. In the connection list, keep boxes checked for the entities that you want to appear in the map. Unchecked entities will be removed from the map. Color coded for alerts Each entity in a map displays a color dependent on its performance. Green: there are currently no violations for this entities performance. Yellow: there is an open warning violation for this entity. Red: there is an open critical violation for this entity. Gray: no alert conditions have been set for the entity White: agent not reporting. This means that the agent installed on the entity is not reporting any data. This is expected behavior for databases or externals. Add maps and charts to dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: adding a service map to a dashboard provides context for the data being reported and where it's coming from. You can add any service map to a dashboard. For example, if you have a dashboard showcasing performance metrics for several entities, adding a service map to the dashboard shows how all the entities are related and provides additional context about your system. To add a service map to a dashboard: Go to one.newrelic.com and select the Explorer. Select an entity from the index. Click on Service map. Click Add to dashboard. Search for the dashboard you want to add the map to. Understand dependencies using API You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with NerdGraph. For more information and examples, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL relationships API tutorial. Externals and databases in maps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types: Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, externals are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported. Databases are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only see the service call is reported to New Relic.

      "body": "Problem When using service maps, you can't view the full set of entities or the relationships between entities that you expect to see. Solution Make sure that the entities are being monitored with an agent. If you have a mix of agents with some having distributed tracing turned on and some having it turned off, you will not see the relations between those agents. The solution for this scenario is to run all agents either with distributed tracing turned on (preferred) or turn it off for all agents. If this does not remedy the issue, the service you're trying to view may require manual instrumentation. When you view applications and services that we automatically instrument in service maps, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some of these services or applications are missing from service maps. Tip Some browser apps are exceptions to this, and may be missing because: Relationships for copy and paste browser agents are not detected. Only the relationships for injected browser agents is shown (the app the agent is injected into). Call relationships (for example, AJAX calling to other apps) are not displayed. If services or apps are missing, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application.",

For help using the current service maps feature, see How to use service maps. Requirements The legacy service map features in APM depend on your New Relic agent version: Feature Requirements App visibility For your app to appear in service maps, one of the following must be true: Your app must have the minimum agent version required for distributed tracing and have distributed tracing enabled. Note: New Relic Mobile apps do not yet support distributed tracing and will not show relationships to applications that have distributed tracing enabled. Your app must have the minimum APM agent version required for cross app tracing and have cross app tracing enabled. Host and instance visibility To view specific hosts, instances, and types of database information, your agent must meet the same minimum agent versions as the APM database and instance feature and use any of the compatible database drivers. Database-only visibility APM's service maps feature includes the ability to opt out of the deeper, host and instance level view. However, to view databases in service maps without the instance-level details, you must still meet the same minimum agent versions as the Database and slow queries features. Create maps The APM service maps feature helps you create your first map by providing default map or architecture suggestions that automatically build a default map (if you have more than ten reporting apps). To view these suggested maps, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service Maps > Suggested maps. To create a new map: Do one of the following: Start from scratch: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Create new map . Copy an existing map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > Save as new. Name your map. Rearrange, group, or add nodes on the map as needed. Important Previously, you could have private service maps. Now, all users can view, edit, and delete all existing or new service maps in the account. Save and rename maps Here are some tips about saving and renaming maps: Save To save changes to a map, select Save. To create a copy of the current map, select Save as new. Rename To rename a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the pencil icon next to the map name. Change the name, then select Save. Add or remove nodes on maps After you create or save a map, build out your map by adding nodes to it. Nodes are added to the map differently based on the node type. To remove any node from the map, mouse over the node, then select the remove X icon. Applications, Mobile apps, plugins Nodes for applications, mobile apps, and plugins (including databases) need to be added to the map in order to add any other nodes. Nodes are added and connected into the map as you select them. The check mark icon means that node is already on the map. To add New Relic monitored apps or plugins to maps: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. Select any applications from the App/Service list. Rearrange or group together as needed. Browser, databases, external services, connected apps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. To add Browser apps, databases, external services, or other connected apps to the map: Select an incoming or outgoing connection widget. From the list of connections, mouse over an app or service, then select the plus icon. Rearrange as needed. Custom nodes To add a custom node to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. From the App/Service list, select Create custom node. Name the node. Add connections: Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. Then select the plus icon on your target node. Select Save. Rearrange as needed. To add or remove custom node connections: Mouse over the custom node and select the pencil icon. Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. To add a connection, select the plus icon. To remove a connection, select the minus icon. Select Save. Move around the map Move around the map by panning or zooming in and out. If you want to... Do this... Pan the map In pan mode, click and drag. In drag-select mode, hold the Alt key, then click and drag. Zoom in and out In either mode, zoom in and out by scrolling the mouse wheel. View your entire map in traffic light mode Zoom out until node details fade out and are replaced by health status colors. Toggle the traffic light view on and off Select Views, then select Traffic light mode. View all the nodes and their dependencies Select Discover your environment. Drill down into more detail from a node Use standard UI functions. Select, arrange, group nodes Click on a node to select it and view its performance summary. You can also select multiple nodes at once, to group and ungroup them: Select nodes To select one node, click on the node. To select multiple nodes: Click the drag-select icon to switch to drag-select mode. Click and drag the mouse to draw a square around the nodes you want to select. OR Hold the Shift key and click on each node you want to select. Arrange nodes Caution Auto-arrange cannot be undone. Consider saving a copy of your map first. To arrange nodes on the map, select one or more node, then drag to a snap point on the map. To automatically organize all your nodes and connections, select Auto-arrange map. Group and ungroup nodes If you want to... Do this... Group nodes together on the map Select two or more nodes, then select Create group. Name your new group Mouse over the group, then select the pencil icon. Rename an existing group Select the pencil icon. Remove nodes from a group Select the group, then select the minus icon for each item you want to remove. Delete maps To delete a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the map name's pencil icon. Select Delete map. Identify issues with external services If your app connects to an external service that New Relic does not monitor (for example, a third-party API), New Relic watches the service for a week in order to baseline its response time. If New Relic can collect a statistically significant number of data points (more than 100), New Relic compares the current response time to this baseline and uses this to set the health status indicator: Green: Response time from the service is less than 1.75 times the baseline. Yellow: Response time from the service is longer than 1.75 times the baseline. Red: Response time from the service is longer than 2.5 times the baseline. Gray: Alerts concluded it does not have enough data to determine the health status. Purple: Alerts cannot yet conclude if it has enough data to determine the health status. Visualize and monitor complex architectures Use service maps to visualize and monitor complex architectures. For a tutorial introducing the latest features, select the service map's question question-circle icon. Nodes Nodes are the basic building blocks for your map. You can add a variety of node types including: Node type Description New Relic APM-monitored app Add your app to the map to view their connections to databases, Browser apps, out-of-process services, and other instrumented apps. (In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are also referred to as web external or background external data.) New Relic Browser apps Automatically detected for each app and added via the incoming connections widget. Only displays Browser apps linked to an APM app (standalone browser apps are not supported). New Relic Mobile apps Automatically detected and added via the app/service list panel. Plugins, including Databases Automatically detected for each app and added via the connections widget. Databases in service maps require the same agent versions as the new Database page features. External services Service maps automatically detects external services (visible in the connections widget), to track your app's external dependencies and monitor the health of those connections. Custom nodes Add custom nodes via the app/service list panel to include apps and services not automatically instrumented by New Relic (for example, load balancers, implementation planning, and so on). Group nodes A group node contains multiple other nodes. For apps, group nodes include a summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. Node arrangement and grouping Click and drag a node to move it around the map, for a customizable view of your architecture. App nodes can also be grouped together into a single node to better organize related apps and services. Grouped nodes include summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. To remove items from a group, mouse over the group and select the pencil pencil icon, then select the minus minus-circle icon to remove the item from the group. Incoming and outgoing connections Service maps automatically detects incoming and outgoing connections based on HTTP calls between entities. Mouse over a node to highlight the node's connections. Widgets at the end of each node display a count of that node's connections, and you can click on those widgets to add related entities to the map: View performance summary Click on an app to view its performance over the last 30 minutes. The chart defaults to Response time, but you can view other metrics by selecting any of the available Apdex, Throughput, or Error rate links. While charts use the last 30 minutes of performance data, the service map as a whole is based on the last five minutes. View the app in APM or Browser and view its labels by selecting the overflow ellipsis-v icon. Click the app name again to hide the summary charts, and select the overflow ellipsis-h icon again to hide other details. Map list and app/service list panels Select the Map list panel to: Search for and view your maps, and access other users' shared maps. Create a new map. Select the App/Service List panel to: Add new apps, mobile apps, and plugins to your map. Create custom nodes and add them to the map. Health status and performance metrics You can see health status indicators for most nodes. Except for out-of-process services (external services or background services), entities use the health status indicators used by New Relic Alerts. For out-of-process (external) services, the health status indicator measures the health of the connection to the external service. View all connected apps and services The Discover your environment feature allows you to view all of your apps, services, and dependencies together with a single click. This feature detects all connected applications and services (including externals and databases) to give you a comprehensive view of your overall software architecture environment. To view all connected apps and services: In APM, select Service maps. From your Map list, select Discover your environment to display all of your nodes. Hover over any node to view its dependencies and how it connects to other parts of your service map. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view their details. The Discover your environment feature may not be available if you are using an older New Relic agent version. See Troubleshooting cross application tracing for version information. This feature may also not be available for highly complex service maps with many elements. Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Discover your environment: Use this option to view all of your nodes and their dependencies in one place. Traffic light mode Traffic light mode lets you view the health status of your entire architecture at a glance. This feature helps you quickly find service and app problems, even within a complex environment with many nodes. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Traffic light mode. When traffic lights mode is On, zooming out far enough on a service map eventually causes the nodes to switch from displaying textual information, to only health status colors. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view more details. Traffic light mode is on by default. When traffic lights mode is Off, service map nodes retain their textual information and do not switch to health status colors, No matter how far you zoom out. one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Views > Traffic light mode: When traffic light mode is enabled, zooming out of your service map displays nodes in health status colors. Midnight mode Midnight mode inverts the screen's colors, going from a white background to a dark background. Midnight mode reduces eye strain, especially in low light environments. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Midnight mode.",

      "body": "Download latest version To use the Diagnostics CLI: Review the release notes, to make sure you have the latest version. Download the latest version, which contains executable files for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Move the executable for your platform into the location of your application's root directory. Temporarily raise the logging level for the New Relic agent for more accurate troubleshooting. After you change the logging level, restart your application. Run the executable. Recommendation: To scope your troubleshooting more easily, run nrdiag with a task suite (CLI option). The Diagnostics CLI automatically searches its root directory and subdirectories for agent configuration files and other relevant data. Platform-specific procedures To run the Diagnostics CLI, follow the procedures for your platform: Linux Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change the directory to your application's root directory and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/linux directory, move nrdiag into the application's root directory. Run nrdiag (along with any CLI options and/or a ticket attachment key): ./nrdiag CLI_OPTIONS Copy The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. macOS Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change directory to the application's root directory and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/mac directory, move nrdiag into the application's root directory. Run nrdiag (along with any CLI options and/or a ticket attachment key): ./nrdiag CLI_OPTIONS Copy The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. Windows Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change directory to the application's root directory, and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/win directory, move nrdiag.exe or nrdiag_x64.exe into the application's root directory. For troubleshooting web applications, ensure you are running the executable from your project's parent directory, or specify your config file location with the -c option. Run the executable (along with any CLI options and/or a ticket attachment key) from the directory you placed the binary. Since some checks require elevated permissions, for best results run from an Admin shell. Run via PowerShell if you add any CLI_OPTIONS: ./nrdiag.exe CLI_OPTIONS Copy OR, for x64 systems: ./nrdiag_x64.exe CLI_OPTIONS Copy The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. Browser monitoring Ensure you have the latest version of the Diagnostics CLI. If necessary, manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/OS directory, run nrdiag (along with any CLI options or a ticket attachment key): ./nrdiag -browser-url WEBSITE_URL CLI_OPTIONS Copy The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. Docker container To troubleshoot your New Relic-instrumented application running in a Docker container, use the docker exec command: Download and unzip the nrdiag_latest.zip file. Copy the binary to the container. Replace IMAGE_NAME with the name of your docker container: docker cp nrdiag/linux/nrdiag IMAGE_NAME:/bin Copy Run the nrdiag command in the docker container. Replace IMAGE_NAME as above, and replace APPLICATION_ROOT with the root directory of your application, where you installed the New Relic agent: docker exec -it -w APPLICATION_ROOT IMAGE_NAME nrdiag Copy (Optional) Remove the nrdiag binary when finished: docker exec IMAGE_NAME rm /bin/nrdiag Copy Suites flag (highly recommended CLI option) A suite is a collection of health checks that target specific products or issues. Using a suite can help narrow the scope of troubleshooting and reduce the occurrence of false positives. To review a list of available suites, run the Diagnostics CLI with the -help suites option: ./nrdiag --help suites Copy To run suites with nrdiag, provide the -suites flag and one or more suite names (for example, java) to run as arguments. Linux, macOS: For 32-bit systems: ./nrdiag --suites SUITE NAMES Copy For 64-bit systems: ./nrdiag_x64 --suites SUITE NAMES Copy Windows: To run from PowerShell, add ./ to the start of cmd. For 32-bit systems: nrdiag.exe --suites SUITE NAMES Copy For 64-bit systems: nrdiag_x64.exe --suites SUITE NAMES Copy View or copy attachment key New Relic Support generates an attachment key for your support ticket, which is used with the Diagnostics CLI. To view or copy your attachment key: Log in to your New Relic account at one.newrelic.com. At the top of any page, click the question icon, click View support tickets, and then select the appropriate support ticket. Copy the NR Diagnostics attachment key that appears at the top of the ticket. Use this attachment key to upload your Diagnostics CLI results to your support ticket. If you do not see the attachment key code, notify Support. Upload results to a support ticket Important If your system is configured to not connect to external IP addresses, this method will not work. Instead, attach the output files in an email to New Relic Support. Automatic upload To upload your results automatically to a New Relic Support ticket when the Diagnostics CLI is executed, use the -attachment-key command line flag with your ticket's attachment key. Uploading your results to a support ticket will automatically upload the contents of nrdiag-output.zip. If you want to inspect or modify the file's contents before upload, follow the manual upload procedures. Linux, macOS, synthetic private minion: ./nrdiag -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY Copy Windows: To run from PowerShell, add ./ to the start of cmd. For 32-bit systems: nrdiag.exe -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY Copy For 64-bit systems: nrdiag_x64.exe -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY Copy Manual upload If you modified or inspected the content of nrdiag-output.zip and want to attach it to a support ticket, you can use the -file-upload and -attachment-key command line flags together to upload a specific file: ./nrdiag -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY -file-upload ZIP_FILENAME Copy",

Deployment example You can also use this feature as a linter to validate a config file before deployment. To do this, run the appropriate task and provide the path to your config file. For example, if your newrelic.yml and nrdiag are both in the current directory, run the following command to lint the config file: ./nrdiag -t Java/Config/ValidateSettings -c newrelic.yml Copy Here is an example of the output for an incorrect setting. The agent_enabled setting in this case has a value of yes, but the Java agent only accepts the values true or false. This misconfiguration will prevent the agent from running. If you enable your Java agent incorrectly, the Diagnostics CLI returns a message like this, describing what setting needs to be updated and how it needs to be changed.",

      "body": "Download latest version To use the Diagnostics CLI: Review the release notes, to make sure you have the latest version. Download the latest version, which contains executable files for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Move the executable for your platform into the location of your application's root directory. Temporarily raise the logging level for the New Relic agent for more accurate troubleshooting. After you change the logging level, restart your application. Run the executable. Recommendation: To scope your troubleshooting more easily, run nrdiag with a task suite (CLI option). The Diagnostics CLI automatically searches its root directory and subdirectories for agent configuration files and other relevant data. Platform-specific procedures To run the Diagnostics CLI, follow the procedures for your platform: Linux Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change the directory to your application's root directory and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/linux directory, move nrdiag into the application's root directory. Run nrdiag (along with any CLI options and/or a ticket attachment key): ./nrdiag CLI_OPTIONS Copy The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. macOS Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change directory to the application's root directory and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/mac directory, move nrdiag into the application's root directory. Run nrdiag (along with any CLI options and/or a ticket attachment key): ./nrdiag CLI_OPTIONS Copy The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. Windows Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change directory to the application's root directory, and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/win directory, move nrdiag.exe or nrdiag_x64.exe into the application's root directory. For troubleshooting web applications, ensure you are running the executable from your project's parent directory, or specify your config file location with the -c option. Run the executable (along with any CLI options and/or a ticket attachment key) from the directory you placed the binary. Since some checks require elevated permissions, for best results run from an Admin shell. Run via PowerShell if you add any CLI_OPTIONS: ./nrdiag.exe CLI_OPTIONS Copy OR, for x64 systems: ./nrdiag_x64.exe CLI_OPTIONS Copy The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. Browser monitoring Ensure you have the latest version of the Diagnostics CLI. If necessary, manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/OS directory, run nrdiag (along with any CLI options or a ticket attachment key): ./nrdiag -browser-url WEBSITE_URL CLI_OPTIONS Copy The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. Docker container To troubleshoot your New Relic-instrumented application running in a Docker container, use the docker exec command: Download and unzip the nrdiag_latest.zip file. Copy the binary to the container. Replace IMAGE_NAME with the name of your docker container: docker cp nrdiag/linux/nrdiag IMAGE_NAME:/bin Copy Run the nrdiag command in the docker container. Replace IMAGE_NAME as above, and replace APPLICATION_ROOT with the root directory of your application, where you installed the New Relic agent: docker exec -it -w APPLICATION_ROOT IMAGE_NAME nrdiag Copy (Optional) Remove the nrdiag binary when finished: docker exec IMAGE_NAME rm /bin/nrdiag Copy Suites flag (highly recommended CLI option) A suite is a collection of health checks that target specific products or issues. Using a suite can help narrow the scope of troubleshooting and reduce the occurrence of false positives. To review a list of available suites, run the Diagnostics CLI with the -help suites option: ./nrdiag --help suites Copy To run suites with nrdiag, provide the -suites flag and one or more suite names (for example, java) to run as arguments. Linux, macOS: For 32-bit systems: ./nrdiag --suites SUITE NAMES Copy For 64-bit systems: ./nrdiag_x64 --suites SUITE NAMES Copy Windows: To run from PowerShell, add ./ to the start of cmd. For 32-bit systems: nrdiag.exe --suites SUITE NAMES Copy For 64-bit systems: nrdiag_x64.exe --suites SUITE NAMES Copy View or copy attachment key New Relic Support generates an attachment key for your support ticket, which is used with the Diagnostics CLI. To view or copy your attachment key: Log in to your New Relic account at one.newrelic.com. At the top of any page, click the question icon, click View support tickets, and then select the appropriate support ticket. Copy the NR Diagnostics attachment key that appears at the top of the ticket. Use this attachment key to upload your Diagnostics CLI results to your support ticket. If you do not see the attachment key code, notify Support. Upload results to a support ticket Important If your system is configured to not connect to external IP addresses, this method will not work. Instead, attach the output files in an email to New Relic Support. Automatic upload To upload your results automatically to a New Relic Support ticket when the Diagnostics CLI is executed, use the -attachment-key command line flag with your ticket's attachment key. Uploading your results to a support ticket will automatically upload the contents of nrdiag-output.zip. If you want to inspect or modify the file's contents before upload, follow the manual upload procedures. Linux, macOS, synthetic private minion: ./nrdiag -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY Copy Windows: To run from PowerShell, add ./ to the start of cmd. For 32-bit systems: nrdiag.exe -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY Copy For 64-bit systems: nrdiag_x64.exe -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY Copy Manual upload If you modified or inspected the content of nrdiag-output.zip and want to attach it to a support ticket, you can use the -file-upload and -attachment-key command line flags together to upload a specific file: ./nrdiag -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY -file-upload ZIP_FILENAME Copy",

Run via PowerShell if you add any CLI_OPTIONS: ./nrdiag.exe CLI_OPTIONS Copy OR, for x64 systems: ./nrdiag_x64.exe CLI_OPTIONS Copy The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. Browser monitoring Ensure you have the latest version of the Diagnostics CLI. If necessary, manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/OS directory, run nrdiag (along with any CLI options or a ticket attachment key): ./nrdiag -browser-url WEBSITE_URL CLI_OPTIONS Copy The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. Docker container To troubleshoot your New Relic-instrumented application running in a Docker container, use the docker exec command: Download and unzip the nrdiag_latest.zip file. Copy the binary to the container. Replace IMAGE_NAME with the name of your docker container: docker cp nrdiag/linux/nrdiag IMAGE_NAME:/bin Copy Run the nrdiag command in the docker container. Replace IMAGE_NAME as above, and replace APPLICATION_ROOT with the root directory of your application, where you installed the New Relic agent: docker exec -it -w APPLICATION_ROOT IMAGE_NAME nrdiag Copy (Optional) Remove the nrdiag binary when finished: docker exec IMAGE_NAME rm /bin/nrdiag Copy Suites flag (highly recommended CLI option) A suite is a collection of health checks that target specific products or issues. Using a suite can help narrow the scope of troubleshooting and reduce the occurrence of false positives. To review a list of available suites, run the Diagnostics CLI with the -help suites option: ./nrdiag --help suites Copy To run suites with nrdiag, provide the -suites flag and one or more suite names (for example, java) to run as arguments. Linux, macOS: For 32-bit systems: ./nrdiag --suites SUITE NAMES Copy For 64-bit systems: ./nrdiag_x64 --suites SUITE NAMES Copy Windows: To run from PowerShell, add ./ to the start of cmd. For 32-bit systems: nrdiag.exe --suites SUITE NAMES Copy For 64-bit systems: nrdiag_x64.exe --suites SUITE NAMES Copy View or copy attachment key New Relic Support generates an attachment key for your support ticket, which is used with the Diagnostics CLI. To view or copy your attachment key: Log in to your New Relic account at one.newrelic.com. At the top of any page, click the question icon, click View support tickets, and then select the appropriate support ticket. Copy the NR Diagnostics attachment key that appears at the top of the ticket. Use this attachment key to upload your Diagnostics CLI results to your support ticket. If you do not see the attachment key code, notify Support. Upload results to a support ticket Important If your system is configured to not connect to external IP addresses, this method will not work. Instead, attach the output files in an email to New Relic Support. Automatic upload To upload your results automatically to a New Relic Support ticket when the Diagnostics CLI is executed, use the -attachment-key command line flag with your ticket's attachment key. Uploading your results to a support ticket will automatically upload the contents of nrdiag-output.zip. If you want to inspect or modify the file's contents before upload, follow the manual upload procedures. Linux, macOS, synthetic private minion: ./nrdiag -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY Copy Windows: To run from PowerShell, add ./ to the start of cmd. For 32-bit systems: nrdiag.exe -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY Copy For 64-bit systems: nrdiag_x64.exe -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY Copy Manual upload If you modified or inspected the content of nrdiag-output.zip and want to attach it to a support ticket, you can use the -file-upload and -attachment-key command line flags together to upload a specific file: ./nrdiag -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY -file-upload ZIP_FILENAME Copy",

If you run nrdiag in the usual manner (on the system running your application with the New Relic agent already installed), the new validation is applied automatically, and any warnings also automatically appear. Deployment example You can also use this feature as a linter to validate a config file before deployment. To do this, run the appropriate task and provide the path to your config file. For example, if your newrelic.yml and nrdiag are both in the current directory, run the following command to lint the config file: ./nrdiag -t Java/Config/ValidateSettings -c newrelic.yml Copy Here is an example of the output for an incorrect setting. The agent_enabled setting in this case has a value of yes, but the Java agent only accepts the values true or false. This misconfiguration will prevent the agent from running. If you enable your Java agent incorrectly, the Diagnostics CLI returns a message like this, describing what setting needs to be updated and how it needs to be changed.",

      "body": "Download latest version To use the Diagnostics CLI: Review the release notes, to make sure you have the latest version. Download the latest version, which contains executable files for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Move the executable for your platform into the location of your application's root directory. Temporarily raise the logging level for the New Relic agent for more accurate troubleshooting. After you change the logging level, restart your application. Run the executable. Recommendation: To scope your troubleshooting more easily, run nrdiag with a task suite (CLI option). The Diagnostics CLI automatically searches its root directory and subdirectories for agent configuration files and other relevant data. Platform-specific procedures To run the Diagnostics CLI, follow the procedures for your platform: Linux Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change the directory to your application's root directory and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/linux directory, move nrdiag into the application's root directory. Run nrdiag (along with any CLI options and/or a ticket attachment key): ./nrdiag CLI_OPTIONS Copy The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. macOS Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change directory to the application's root directory and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/mac directory, move nrdiag into the application's root directory. Run nrdiag (along with any CLI options and/or a ticket attachment key): ./nrdiag CLI_OPTIONS Copy The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. Windows Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change directory to the application's root directory, and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/win directory, move nrdiag.exe or nrdiag_x64.exe into the application's root directory. For troubleshooting web applications, ensure you are running the executable from your project's parent directory, or specify your config file location with the -c option. Run the executable (along with any CLI options and/or a ticket attachment key) from the directory you placed the binary. Since some checks require elevated permissions, for best results run from an Admin shell. Run via PowerShell if you add any CLI_OPTIONS: ./nrdiag.exe CLI_OPTIONS Copy OR, for x64 systems: ./nrdiag_x64.exe CLI_OPTIONS Copy The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. Browser monitoring Ensure you have the latest version of the Diagnostics CLI. If necessary, manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/OS directory, run nrdiag (along with any CLI options or a ticket attachment key): ./nrdiag -browser-url WEBSITE_URL CLI_OPTIONS Copy The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key. Docker container To troubleshoot your New Relic-instrumented application running in a Docker container, use the docker exec command: Download and unzip the nrdiag_latest.zip file. Copy the binary to the container. Replace IMAGE_NAME with the name of your docker container: docker cp nrdiag/linux/nrdiag IMAGE_NAME:/bin Copy Run the nrdiag command in the docker container. Replace IMAGE_NAME as above, and replace APPLICATION_ROOT with the root directory of your application, where you installed the New Relic agent: docker exec -it -w APPLICATION_ROOT IMAGE_NAME nrdiag Copy (Optional) Remove the nrdiag binary when finished: docker exec IMAGE_NAME rm /bin/nrdiag Copy Suites flag (highly recommended CLI option) A suite is a collection of health checks that target specific products or issues. Using a suite can help narrow the scope of troubleshooting and reduce the occurrence of false positives. To review a list of available suites, run the Diagnostics CLI with the -help suites option: ./nrdiag --help suites Copy To run suites with nrdiag, provide the -suites flag and one or more suite names (for example, java) to run as arguments. Linux, macOS: For 32-bit systems: ./nrdiag --suites SUITE NAMES Copy For 64-bit systems: ./nrdiag_x64 --suites SUITE NAMES Copy Windows: To run from PowerShell, add ./ to the start of cmd. For 32-bit systems: nrdiag.exe --suites SUITE NAMES Copy For 64-bit systems: nrdiag_x64.exe --suites SUITE NAMES Copy View or copy attachment key New Relic Support generates an attachment key for your support ticket, which is used with the Diagnostics CLI. To view or copy your attachment key: Log in to your New Relic account at one.newrelic.com. At the top of any page, click the question icon, click View support tickets, and then select the appropriate support ticket. Copy the NR Diagnostics attachment key that appears at the top of the ticket. Use this attachment key to upload your Diagnostics CLI results to your support ticket. If you do not see the attachment key code, notify Support. Upload results to a support ticket Important If your system is configured to not connect to external IP addresses, this method will not work. Instead, attach the output files in an email to New Relic Support. Automatic upload To upload your results automatically to a New Relic Support ticket when the Diagnostics CLI is executed, use the -attachment-key command line flag with your ticket's attachment key. Uploading your results to a support ticket will automatically upload the contents of nrdiag-output.zip. If you want to inspect or modify the file's contents before upload, follow the manual upload procedures. Linux, macOS, synthetic private minion: ./nrdiag -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY Copy Windows: To run from PowerShell, add ./ to the start of cmd. For 32-bit systems: nrdiag.exe -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY Copy For 64-bit systems: nrdiag_x64.exe -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY Copy Manual upload If you modified or inspected the content of nrdiag-output.zip and want to attach it to a support ticket, you can use the -file-upload and -attachment-key command line flags together to upload a specific file: ./nrdiag -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY -file-upload ZIP_FILENAME Copy",

This document contains links to docs on how to do this for APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and mobile monitoring. APM: Record custom attributes Important Review the list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Using reserved terms can cause issues. To enable and use custom attributes for APM, follow the procedure for your APM agent: C SDK To add custom attributes to applications monitored by the C SDK, call one of the attribute functions; for example, newrelic_add_attribute_double(). The key name for your custom attribute depends on what you specify when you call the function. Go Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in the Go agent. However, you can disable custom attribute collection. Java Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Java. You can collect custom attributes using XML and the Java agent APIs. These two methods can be used in conjunction with each other. Method How to do it Specify attributes in XML XML allows you to specify custom attributes without changing any of your source code. You can have multiple XML files for custom attributes that are grouped by some logical facet. To set custom attributes for your Java app via XML: Review the New Relic Java agent's documentation about XML file format, methods and classes, and examples. From your Extensions directory within the New Relic Java agent, create a single XML file. Define the methods you want New Relic to monitor by editing your XML file directly. Define an XML instrumentation file using the New Relic UI. This may require additional config in the common: block of your newrelic.yml. See Report custom attributes under Instrumentation options for more detail. Call the agent's API Example 1: Adding custom attributes to transactions To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each method you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with attributes.include and attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId, include this code in the parent method: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); Copy Example 2: Adding custom attributes to spans in distributed traces To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each span (currently executing method) that you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with span_events.attributes.include and span_events.attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId on the current span, include this code in the associated method: NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(\"userId\", userId); Copy Collect user attributes The Java agent also includes a built-in mechanism to enable user attributes and collect user information from HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal() as custom attributes. .NET Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in .NET. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For each method for which you want to record an attribute, call AddCustomAttribute. Optional: Include or exclude attributes with the include and exclude configuration options. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code (string) and an item ID code (number), you could include this code in the parent method: IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; transaction .AddCustomAttribute(\"Discount Code\", \"Summer Super Sale\") .AddCustomAttribute(\"Item Code\", 31456); Copy Node.js Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Node.js. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method: For each attribute you want to record, call newrelic.addCustomAttribute. To record multiple attributes using a single call, use newrelic.addCustomAttributes. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code and an item ID code, you could include this in the parent method: newrelic.addCustomAttributes({ \"Discount Code\": \"Summer Super Sale\", \"Item Code\": 31456 }); Copy PHP Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in PHP. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method for each method that you want to record an attribute; newrelic_add_custom_parameter for transaction events and spans newrelic_add_custom_span_parameter for only spans For example, to record a variable named $userId, include this code in the parent method: newrelic_add_custom_parameter ('userID', $userId) Copy Python Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Python. To collect custom attributes, call add_custom_parameter for each method that you want to record an attribute. For example, to record a variable named user_id, include this code in the parent method: newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameter('user_id', user_id) Copy Ruby Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Ruby. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For Ruby agent version 3.12.0 or higher, use the add_custom_attributes method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_attributes({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy For Ruby agent version 3.11.2 or lower, use the add_custom_parameters method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_parameters({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy Browser monitoring: Record custom attributes The browser agent provides an API to specify extra details associated with a page view or browser interaction, either by forwarding attributes from APM to browser monitoring or by specifying custom attributes through JavaScript. Values forwarded from the APM agent are encoded and injected into browser attributes by our browser agent. Infrastructure monitoring: Record custom attributes Our Infrastructure monitoring lets you create custom attributes that are used to annotate the data from the infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data.

      "body": "New Relic allows you to collect custom attributes. For example, you can create a custom attribute to track the user name associated with a slow or failing request. This document contains links to docs on how to do this for APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and mobile monitoring. APM: Record custom attributes Important Review the list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Using reserved terms can cause issues. To enable and use custom attributes for APM, follow the procedure for your APM agent: C SDK To add custom attributes to applications monitored by the C SDK, call one of the attribute functions; for example, newrelic_add_attribute_double(). The key name for your custom attribute depends on what you specify when you call the function. Go Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in the Go agent. However, you can disable custom attribute collection. Java Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Java. You can collect custom attributes using XML and the Java agent APIs. These two methods can be used in conjunction with each other. Method How to do it Specify attributes in XML XML allows you to specify custom attributes without changing any of your source code. You can have multiple XML files for custom attributes that are grouped by some logical facet. To set custom attributes for your Java app via XML: Review the New Relic Java agent's documentation about XML file format, methods and classes, and examples. From your Extensions directory within the New Relic Java agent, create a single XML file. Define the methods you want New Relic to monitor by editing your XML file directly. Define an XML instrumentation file using the New Relic UI. This may require additional config in the common: block of your newrelic.yml. See Report custom attributes under Instrumentation options for more detail. Call the agent's API Example 1: Adding custom attributes to transactions To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each method you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with attributes.include and attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId, include this code in the parent method: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); Copy Example 2: Adding custom attributes to spans in distributed traces To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each span (currently executing method) that you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with span_events.attributes.include and span_events.attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId on the current span, include this code in the associated method: NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(\"userId\", userId); Copy Collect user attributes The Java agent also includes a built-in mechanism to enable user attributes and collect user information from HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal() as custom attributes. .NET Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in .NET. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For each method for which you want to record an attribute, call AddCustomAttribute. Optional: Include or exclude attributes with the include and exclude configuration options. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code (string) and an item ID code (number), you could include this code in the parent method: IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; transaction .AddCustomAttribute(\"Discount Code\", \"Summer Super Sale\") .AddCustomAttribute(\"Item Code\", 31456); Copy Node.js Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Node.js. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method: For each attribute you want to record, call newrelic.addCustomAttribute. To record multiple attributes using a single call, use newrelic.addCustomAttributes. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code and an item ID code, you could include this in the parent method: newrelic.addCustomAttributes({ \"Discount Code\": \"Summer Super Sale\", \"Item Code\": 31456 }); Copy PHP Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in PHP. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method for each method that you want to record an attribute; newrelic_add_custom_parameter for transaction events and spans newrelic_add_custom_span_parameter for only spans For example, to record a variable named $userId, include this code in the parent method: newrelic_add_custom_parameter ('userID', $userId) Copy Python Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Python. To collect custom attributes, call add_custom_parameter for each method that you want to record an attribute. For example, to record a variable named user_id, include this code in the parent method: newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameter('user_id', user_id) Copy Ruby Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Ruby. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For Ruby agent version 3.12.0 or higher, use the add_custom_attributes method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_attributes({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy For Ruby agent version 3.11.2 or lower, use the add_custom_parameters method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_parameters({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy Browser monitoring: Record custom attributes The browser agent provides an API to specify extra details associated with a page view or browser interaction, either by forwarding attributes from APM to browser monitoring or by specifying custom attributes through JavaScript. Values forwarded from the APM agent are encoded and injected into browser attributes by our browser agent. Infrastructure monitoring: Record custom attributes Our Infrastructure monitoring lets you create custom attributes that are used to annotate the data from the infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. Mobile monitoring: Record custom attributes Mobile agents include API calls to record custom attributes: For an overview of mobile monitoring custom data, see Insert custom events and attributes Android method: setAttribute iOS method: setAttribute For more help",

      "body": "This list is current. Last updated 13 November 2020. This is a list of the networks, IP addresses, domains, ports, and endpoints used by New Relic collectors (for example, https://collector.newrelic.com) to communicate with a New Relic agent. TLS is required for all domains. TLS encryption To ensure data security for our customers and to be in compliance with FedRAMP and other standards for data encryption, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is required for all domains. Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post about TLS 1.2. In addition, TLS 1.2 is required for most domains, except: APM agent connections Browser agent connections Mobile agent connections Event API For future updates to required and supported protocol versions, follow the Security Notifications tag in New Relic's Explorers Hub. APM agents To enhance network performance and data security, New Relic uses a CDN and DDoS prevention service with a large IP range. New Relic agents require your firewall to allow outgoing connections to the following networks and ports. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections APM data Networks US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Ports US region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 EU region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 Endpoints US region accounts: collector*.newrelic.com EU region accounts: collector*.eu01.nr-data.net:443 (recommended) Recommendation: Use port 443, a secured channel for encrypted HTTPS traffic. Some New Relic agents also offer port 80, an unsecured channel open to all HTTP traffic. While some agents can be configured to use both port 80 and port 443, we recommend that you choose the port 443 (default). If you have an existing configuration that uses port 80, you can update it to use port 443, the default New Relic connection. Agent downloads TLS is required for all domains. Service for download.newrelic.com is provided through Fastly and is subject to change without warning. For the most current list of public IP addresses for New Relic agent downloads, see api.fastly.com/public-ip-list. Infrastructure agents In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure monitoring needs outbound access to these domains, networks, and ports. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Infrastructure data Domains infra-api.newrelic.com identity-api.newrelic.com infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com log-api.newrelic.com log-api.eu.newrelic.com metric-api.newrelic.com Networks For US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 For EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Port 443 Domains + Port For US region accounts: infra-api.newrelic.com:443 identity-api.newrelic.com:443 infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com:443 log-api.newrelic.com:443 metric-api.newrelic.com:443 For EU region accounts: infra-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 identity-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 infrastructure-command-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 log-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 metric-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 Proxy If your system needs a proxy to connect to this domain, use the Infrastructure proxy setting. Browser domains In addition to the IP addresses for APM agents, applications monitored by our browser agents use outgoing connections to the following domains. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: For US region accounts: bam.nr-data.net js-agent.newrelic.com For EU region accounts: eu01.nr-data.net bam.eu01.nr-data.net For more information about CDN access for the js-agent.newrelic.com file to the domain bam.nr-data.net or to one of the New Relic beacons, see Security for browser monitoring. Mobile domains In addition to the IP addresses for APM agents, applications monitored by our mobile agents use outgoing connections to the following domains. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: For US region accounts: mobile-collector.newrelic.com mobile-crash.newrelic.com mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com For EU region accounts: mobile-collector.eu01.nr-data.net mobile-crash.eu01.nr-data.net mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net Synthetic monitor public locations To configure your firewall to allow synthetic monitors to access your monitored URL, use Synthetic public minion IPs. TLS is required for all domains. Synthetic monitor private locations Synthetic private minions report to a specific endpoint based on region. Configure your firewall to allow the private minion to access the endpoint or the static IP addresses associated with the endpoint. These IP addresses may change in the future. TLS is required for all domains.

      "body": "New Relic allows you to collect custom attributes. For example, you can create a custom attribute to track the user name associated with a slow or failing request. This document contains links to docs on how to do this for APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and mobile monitoring. APM: Record custom attributes Important Review the list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Using reserved terms can cause issues. To enable and use custom attributes for APM, follow the procedure for your APM agent: C SDK To add custom attributes to applications monitored by the C SDK, call one of the attribute functions; for example, newrelic_add_attribute_double(). The key name for your custom attribute depends on what you specify when you call the function. Go Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in the Go agent. However, you can disable custom attribute collection. Java Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Java. You can collect custom attributes using XML and the Java agent APIs. These two methods can be used in conjunction with each other. Method How to do it Specify attributes in XML XML allows you to specify custom attributes without changing any of your source code. You can have multiple XML files for custom attributes that are grouped by some logical facet. To set custom attributes for your Java app via XML: Review the New Relic Java agent's documentation about XML file format, methods and classes, and examples. From your Extensions directory within the New Relic Java agent, create a single XML file. Define the methods you want New Relic to monitor by editing your XML file directly. Define an XML instrumentation file using the New Relic UI. This may require additional config in the common: block of your newrelic.yml. See Report custom attributes under Instrumentation options for more detail. Call the agent's API Example 1: Adding custom attributes to transactions To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each method you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with attributes.include and attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId, include this code in the parent method: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); Copy Example 2: Adding custom attributes to spans in distributed traces To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each span (currently executing method) that you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with span_events.attributes.include and span_events.attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId on the current span, include this code in the associated method: NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(\"userId\", userId); Copy Collect user attributes The Java agent also includes a built-in mechanism to enable user attributes and collect user information from HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal() as custom attributes. .NET Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in .NET. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For each method for which you want to record an attribute, call AddCustomAttribute. Optional: Include or exclude attributes with the include and exclude configuration options. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code (string) and an item ID code (number), you could include this code in the parent method: IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; transaction .AddCustomAttribute(\"Discount Code\", \"Summer Super Sale\") .AddCustomAttribute(\"Item Code\", 31456); Copy Node.js Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Node.js. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method: For each attribute you want to record, call newrelic.addCustomAttribute. To record multiple attributes using a single call, use newrelic.addCustomAttributes. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code and an item ID code, you could include this in the parent method: newrelic.addCustomAttributes({ \"Discount Code\": \"Summer Super Sale\", \"Item Code\": 31456 }); Copy PHP Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in PHP. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method for each method that you want to record an attribute; newrelic_add_custom_parameter for transaction events and spans newrelic_add_custom_span_parameter for only spans For example, to record a variable named $userId, include this code in the parent method: newrelic_add_custom_parameter ('userID', $userId) Copy Python Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Python. To collect custom attributes, call add_custom_parameter for each method that you want to record an attribute. For example, to record a variable named user_id, include this code in the parent method: newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameter('user_id', user_id) Copy Ruby Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Ruby. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For Ruby agent version 3.12.0 or higher, use the add_custom_attributes method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_attributes({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy For Ruby agent version 3.11.2 or lower, use the add_custom_parameters method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_parameters({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy Browser monitoring: Record custom attributes The browser agent provides an API to specify extra details associated with a page view or browser interaction, either by forwarding attributes from APM to browser monitoring or by specifying custom attributes through JavaScript. Values forwarded from the APM agent are encoded and injected into browser attributes by our browser agent. Infrastructure monitoring: Record custom attributes Our Infrastructure monitoring lets you create custom attributes that are used to annotate the data from the infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data.

      "body": "New Relic allows you to collect custom attributes. For example, you can create a custom attribute to track the user name associated with a slow or failing request. This document contains links to docs on how to do this for APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and mobile monitoring. APM: Record custom attributes Important Review the list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Using reserved terms can cause issues. To enable and use custom attributes for APM, follow the procedure for your APM agent: C SDK To add custom attributes to applications monitored by the C SDK, call one of the attribute functions; for example, newrelic_add_attribute_double(). The key name for your custom attribute depends on what you specify when you call the function. Go Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in the Go agent. However, you can disable custom attribute collection. Java Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Java. You can collect custom attributes using XML and the Java agent APIs. These two methods can be used in conjunction with each other. Method How to do it Specify attributes in XML XML allows you to specify custom attributes without changing any of your source code. You can have multiple XML files for custom attributes that are grouped by some logical facet. To set custom attributes for your Java app via XML: Review the New Relic Java agent's documentation about XML file format, methods and classes, and examples. From your Extensions directory within the New Relic Java agent, create a single XML file. Define the methods you want New Relic to monitor by editing your XML file directly. Define an XML instrumentation file using the New Relic UI. This may require additional config in the common: block of your newrelic.yml. See Report custom attributes under Instrumentation options for more detail. Call the agent's API Example 1: Adding custom attributes to transactions To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each method you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with attributes.include and attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId, include this code in the parent method: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); Copy Example 2: Adding custom attributes to spans in distributed traces To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each span (currently executing method) that you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with span_events.attributes.include and span_events.attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId on the current span, include this code in the associated method: NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(\"userId\", userId); Copy Collect user attributes The Java agent also includes a built-in mechanism to enable user attributes and collect user information from HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal() as custom attributes. .NET Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in .NET. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For each method for which you want to record an attribute, call AddCustomAttribute. Optional: Include or exclude attributes with the include and exclude configuration options. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code (string) and an item ID code (number), you could include this code in the parent method: IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; transaction .AddCustomAttribute(\"Discount Code\", \"Summer Super Sale\") .AddCustomAttribute(\"Item Code\", 31456); Copy Node.js Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Node.js. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method: For each attribute you want to record, call newrelic.addCustomAttribute. To record multiple attributes using a single call, use newrelic.addCustomAttributes. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code and an item ID code, you could include this in the parent method: newrelic.addCustomAttributes({ \"Discount Code\": \"Summer Super Sale\", \"Item Code\": 31456 }); Copy PHP Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in PHP. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method for each method that you want to record an attribute; newrelic_add_custom_parameter for transaction events and spans newrelic_add_custom_span_parameter for only spans For example, to record a variable named $userId, include this code in the parent method: newrelic_add_custom_parameter ('userID', $userId) Copy Python Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Python. To collect custom attributes, call add_custom_parameter for each method that you want to record an attribute. For example, to record a variable named user_id, include this code in the parent method: newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameter('user_id', user_id) Copy Ruby Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Ruby. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For Ruby agent version 3.12.0 or higher, use the add_custom_attributes method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_attributes({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy For Ruby agent version 3.11.2 or lower, use the add_custom_parameters method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_parameters({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy Browser monitoring: Record custom attributes The browser agent provides an API to specify extra details associated with a page view or browser interaction, either by forwarding attributes from APM to browser monitoring or by specifying custom attributes through JavaScript. Values forwarded from the APM agent are encoded and injected into browser attributes by our browser agent. Infrastructure monitoring: Record custom attributes Our Infrastructure monitoring lets you create custom attributes that are used to annotate the data from the infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. Mobile monitoring: Record custom attributes Mobile agents include API calls to record custom attributes: For an overview of mobile monitoring custom data, see Insert custom events and attributes Android method: setAttribute iOS method: setAttribute For more help",

      "body": "This list is current. Last updated 13 November 2020. This is a list of the networks, IP addresses, domains, ports, and endpoints used by New Relic collectors (for example, https://collector.newrelic.com) to communicate with a New Relic agent. TLS is required for all domains. TLS encryption To ensure data security for our customers and to be in compliance with FedRAMP and other standards for data encryption, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is required for all domains. Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post about TLS 1.2. In addition, TLS 1.2 is required for most domains, except: APM agent connections Browser agent connections Mobile agent connections Event API For future updates to required and supported protocol versions, follow the Security Notifications tag in New Relic's Explorers Hub. APM agents To enhance network performance and data security, New Relic uses a CDN and DDoS prevention service with a large IP range. New Relic agents require your firewall to allow outgoing connections to the following networks and ports. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections APM data Networks US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Ports US region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 EU region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 Endpoints US region accounts: collector*.newrelic.com EU region accounts: collector*.eu01.nr-data.net:443 (recommended) Recommendation: Use port 443, a secured channel for encrypted HTTPS traffic. Some New Relic agents also offer port 80, an unsecured channel open to all HTTP traffic. While some agents can be configured to use both port 80 and port 443, we recommend that you choose the port 443 (default). If you have an existing configuration that uses port 80, you can update it to use port 443, the default New Relic connection. Agent downloads TLS is required for all domains. Service for download.newrelic.com is provided through Fastly and is subject to change without warning. For the most current list of public IP addresses for New Relic agent downloads, see api.fastly.com/public-ip-list. Infrastructure agents In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure monitoring needs outbound access to these domains, networks, and ports. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Infrastructure data Domains infra-api.newrelic.com identity-api.newrelic.com infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com log-api.newrelic.com log-api.eu.newrelic.com metric-api.newrelic.com Networks For US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 For EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Port 443 Domains + Port For US region accounts: infra-api.newrelic.com:443 identity-api.newrelic.com:443 infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com:443 log-api.newrelic.com:443 metric-api.newrelic.com:443 For EU region accounts: infra-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 identity-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 infrastructure-command-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 log-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 metric-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 Proxy If your system needs a proxy to connect to this domain, use the Infrastructure proxy setting. Browser domains In addition to the IP addresses for APM agents, applications monitored by our browser agents use outgoing connections to the following domains. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: For US region accounts: bam.nr-data.net js-agent.newrelic.com For EU region accounts: eu01.nr-data.net bam.eu01.nr-data.net For more information about CDN access for the js-agent.newrelic.com file to the domain bam.nr-data.net or to one of the New Relic beacons, see Security for browser monitoring. Mobile domains In addition to the IP addresses for APM agents, applications monitored by our mobile agents use outgoing connections to the following domains. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: For US region accounts: mobile-collector.newrelic.com mobile-crash.newrelic.com mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com For EU region accounts: mobile-collector.eu01.nr-data.net mobile-crash.eu01.nr-data.net mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net Synthetic monitor public locations To configure your firewall to allow synthetic monitors to access your monitored URL, use Synthetic public minion IPs. TLS is required for all domains. Synthetic monitor private locations Synthetic private minions report to a specific endpoint based on region. Configure your firewall to allow the private minion to access the endpoint or the static IP addresses associated with the endpoint. These IP addresses may change in the future. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Synthetics private location data Endpoint For US region accounts: https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/ For EU region accounts: https://synthetics-horde.eu01.nr-data.net/ IP addresses For US region accounts: 13.248.153.51 76.223.21.185 For EU region accounts: 185.221.86.57 185.221.86.25 Alerts webhooks, api.newrelic.com, and ticketing integrations Endpoints that use api.newrelic.com (such as our GraphQL API for NerdGraph) and our New Relic-generated webhooks for alert policies use an IP address from designated network blocks for the US or European Union region. TLS is required for all addresses in these blocks. Network blocks for US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 Network blocks for EU region accounts: 158.177.65.64/29 159.122.103.184/29 161.156.125.32/28 These network blocks also apply to third-party ticketing integrations.",

To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For Ruby agent version 3.12.0 or higher, use the add_custom_attributes method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_attributes({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy For Ruby agent version 3.11.2 or lower, use the add_custom_parameters method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_parameters({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy Browser monitoring: Record custom attributes The browser agent provides an API to specify extra details associated with a page view or browser interaction, either by forwarding attributes from APM to browser monitoring or by specifying custom attributes through JavaScript. Values forwarded from the APM agent are encoded and injected into browser attributes by our browser agent. Infrastructure monitoring: Record custom attributes Our Infrastructure monitoring lets you create custom attributes that are used to annotate the data from the infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. Mobile monitoring: Record custom attributes Mobile agents include API calls to record custom attributes: For an overview of mobile monitoring custom data, see Insert custom events and attributes Android method: setAttribute iOS method: setAttribute For more help",

      "body": "Problem For our APM, browser monitoring, and mobile monitoring features, there can be cases when an account or application is sending many individual metrics that could be better managed by grouping them together. We use the term metric grouping issue or MGI to describe this situation. When this occurs, the agent is sending unnecessarily large amounts of data to New Relic, which reduces the effectiveness of New Relic charts, tables, and reports. Metric grouping issues occur most commonly with web transactions, especially if the name is based on URLs. They can also happen with other metrics reported by your application. For example: If your application is crawling the Internet and each external call goes to a different domain If your software dynamically generates temporary database tables every time you receive a request If you are using custom instrumentation that includes UUIDs, article names, or similar unique components Any situation where a potentially infinite list of metrics can be created, rather than metrics being grouped effectively (as with controllers, permanent database tables, or specific external services) can become a metric grouping issue. Solution By understanding what metric grouping is and how issues can arise, you can better understand how New Relic works with your application to group metrics effectively and help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring. Here is a \"before\" and \"after\" example of how metric grouping can help organize transactions, to help you more easily identify patterns with performance problems. To help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring in your app: Check the New Relic release notes to verify you're running the most current version of the New Relic agent. If needed, upgrade your APM/mobile/browser agent to the most current version. Wait a few minutes, then look at new data in the New Relic UI. If the problem persists, follow the procedures for your agent: Agent Preventing MGIs All agents Review the information about what causes metric grouping issues. Browser Add URL groupings. C SDK Avoid using URLs to name your transactions. Instead, follow the procedures to instrument your app with the C SDK. Go Rename your Go transactions. Java See Java metric grouping issues. .NET Rename metrics with SetTransactionName. For more information about using XML to add details, see Name transactions. Node.js Rename transactions with Request API calls. PHP Rename your PHP transactions. Python Rename your Python transactions with set_transaction_name. Ruby Rename your Ruby transactions. Cause Metric grouping issues occur when the granularity of metric names (most often web transaction names) is too fine, resulting in hundreds or thousands of different web transaction names for just a small number of code paths. A few major code paths may generate many different full URL paths to unique documents, articles, or page, etc., and if the unique element of the URL path is included in the transaction name, each of these common paths will have its own unique name. MGI example In this example, you have an application that lets users write articles on any subject and post them for other users to see. Your application has three main functions: add an article, search for an article, and display an article. In order to improve search engine optimization (SEO), the \"view article\" code generates a unique URL to refer to each article. For example, the following URLs each refer to different articles in the example website: http://example.com/article/view/How_to_Install_New_Relic http://example.com/article/view/How_New_Relic_Saved_the_Day http://example.com/article/view/Where_do_I_get_New_Relic Copy All three articles are different; they contain different content and their URLs are different. However, the code path that generates each article is the same: they all use the \"view article\" function. Many web frameworks use this technique. They have a controller or route (in this case named article/view) as part of the URL. New Relic works to automatically identify these patterns and group similar routes together, to prevent metric grouping issues from occurring. Without mechanisms for detecting controllers, the example application would send metrics for each individual URL requested by visitors to your site. If you have a million articles and your site is popular, in each minute there could be several thousand unique URLs visited. This produces a significant amount of additional data to be sent to New Relic for each harvest cycle, and the APM Transactions page would attempt to list thousands of unique URLs, resulting in metric grouping issues. To monitor and improve your application performance, it's much more useful to know the average performance for a function (for example, viewing articles on your site) than how quickly each individual article is displayed. To prevent metric grouping issues, New Relic will normally show a single entry for that function (for example, /article/view/*) on the APM Transactions page. This grouping gives you a much better idea of how much time was spent viewing articles, and allows you to easily spot any performance problems related to viewing articles. If these statistics were spread across hundreds or thousands of transactions, detecting trends, regressions, or performance improvements would be extremely difficult. Each APM agent has distinct ways of detecting controllers and frameworks. Most are automatic, but a few require you to enable or disable options in a config file. You can also follow our recommendations to help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring.",

Node.js Rename transactions with Request API calls. PHP Rename your PHP transactions. Python Rename your Python transactions with set_transaction_name. Ruby Rename your Ruby transactions. Cause Metric grouping issues occur when the granularity of metric names (most often web transaction names) is too fine, resulting in hundreds or thousands of different web transaction names for just a small number of code paths. A few major code paths may generate many different full URL paths to unique documents, articles, or page, etc., and if the unique element of the URL path is included in the transaction name, each of these common paths will have its own unique name. MGI example In this example, you have an application that lets users write articles on any subject and post them for other users to see. Your application has three main functions: add an article, search for an article, and display an article. In order to improve search engine optimization (SEO), the \"view article\" code generates a unique URL to refer to each article. For example, the following URLs each refer to different articles in the example website: http://example.com/article/view/How_to_Install_New_Relic http://example.com/article/view/How_New_Relic_Saved_the_Day http://example.com/article/view/Where_do_I_get_New_Relic Copy All three articles are different; they contain different content and their URLs are different. However, the code path that generates each article is the same: they all use the \"view article\" function. Many web frameworks use this technique. They have a controller or route (in this case named article/view) as part of the URL. New Relic works to automatically identify these patterns and group similar routes together, to prevent metric grouping issues from occurring. Without mechanisms for detecting controllers, the example application would send metrics for each individual URL requested by visitors to your site. If you have a million articles and your site is popular, in each minute there could be several thousand unique URLs visited. This produces a significant amount of additional data to be sent to New Relic for each harvest cycle, and the APM Transactions page would attempt to list thousands of unique URLs, resulting in metric grouping issues. To monitor and improve your application performance, it's much more useful to know the average performance for a function (for example, viewing articles on your site) than how quickly each individual article is displayed. To prevent metric grouping issues, New Relic will normally show a single entry for that function (for example, /article/view/*) on the APM Transactions page. This grouping gives you a much better idea of how much time was spent viewing articles, and allows you to easily spot any performance problems related to viewing articles. If these statistics were spread across hundreds or thousands of transactions, detecting trends, regressions, or performance improvements would be extremely difficult. Each APM agent has distinct ways of detecting controllers and frameworks. Most are automatic, but a few require you to enable or disable options in a config file. You can also follow our recommendations to help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring.",

      "body": "Some New Relic solutions require installation of an agent. The agent root directory is the main folder that holds the files for the agent. Typically, the agent root directory is the directory where the agent install process places the agent configuration file. You may need to find the agent root directory for several reasons: To customize your configuration file. To run New Relic Diagnostics. To install, update, or uninstall the agent. To troubleshoot if no data appears in the New Relic UI. Tip These strategies for finding the root directory are applicable if you followed the default install procedure. If you installed to a different directory, this information might not apply. APM agents The agent root directory depends on the agent you're using: C SDK The C SDK may not necessarily be installed in a single place, and it does not have an installation tool or script. The \"root directory\" depends on what the user does. In general, the root directory is the location of the libnewrelic.so or libnewrelic.a library file as well as the location of the libnewrelic.h file. Go agent The Go agent root directory is the root directory of your app, where you imported the go-agent package when you installed the Go agent. Java agent The Java agent root directory is called newrelic, which you created in your app server's root directory when you installed the Java agent. .NET Core 2.0 agent The location of the .NET Core 2.0 agent root directory depends on your system: System Location of the agent root directory Windows Look in the CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME environment variable for your application to find the location of the agent root directory. Linux The location of the agent root directory is /usr/local/newrelic-netcore20-agent. You can also look in the CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME environment variable for your application to find the location of the agent root directory. Docker In the root directory for your app, look for the agent root directory called NewRelic, which you created when you installed the Core 2.0 agent with Docker. .NET Framework agent The location of the .NET Framework agent root directory is C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\.NET Agent. Node.js agent The Node.js agent root directory is the root directory of your app, where you copied newrelic.js when you installed the Node.js agent. PHP agent The location of the PHP agent root directory depends on how you installed the agent: Installation method Root directory location With a package manager or tar archive Use phpinfo() and look in the sections called Scan this dir for additional .ini files or Additional .ini files parsed for the location of the newrelic.ini file. This file will be in the agent root directory, which is called newrelic-php5. Tip The PHP agent root directory is called newrelic-php5 for all supported PHP versions, including PHP 7. With a configuration system, like Puppet or Chef To find all of the locations where the PHP agent was installed, check the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable for a list of agent root directories. Python agent You can install the Python agent anywhere on your host system and then supply a path to it through the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable or the newrelic.agent.initialize() API call. To find the location of the agent config file, look in the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable or the newrelic.agent.initialize() call for the path to the agent root directory. Ruby agent The location of the Ruby agent root directory depends on how you installed the agent: Installation method Root directory location With the newrelic_rpm gem The Ruby agent root directory is in the root directory of your app in a directory called config. Without the gem Look in the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH environment variable for the path to the agent root directory. If there isn't a path in that environment variable, check the following directories to find the one that contains the newrelic.yml file: config $HOME/.newrelic/ $HOME/ Mobile agent The mobile agent root directory is the root directory of your app. Infrastructure agent The location of the infrastructure agent root directory depends on your system: Infrastructure agent System Root directory location Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\ Linux, Docker, and Elastic Beanstalk /etc On-host integrations The location of the root directory for on-host integrations is /etc. Cloud integrations Because cloud integrations are not installed but are connected to our infrastructure monitoring through your cloud service provider, there is not a root directory specific to cloud integrations.

      "body": "Problem For our APM, browser monitoring, and mobile monitoring features, there can be cases when an account or application is sending many individual metrics that could be better managed by grouping them together. We use the term metric grouping issue or MGI to describe this situation. When this occurs, the agent is sending unnecessarily large amounts of data to New Relic, which reduces the effectiveness of New Relic charts, tables, and reports. Metric grouping issues occur most commonly with web transactions, especially if the name is based on URLs. They can also happen with other metrics reported by your application. For example: If your application is crawling the Internet and each external call goes to a different domain If your software dynamically generates temporary database tables every time you receive a request If you are using custom instrumentation that includes UUIDs, article names, or similar unique components Any situation where a potentially infinite list of metrics can be created, rather than metrics being grouped effectively (as with controllers, permanent database tables, or specific external services) can become a metric grouping issue. Solution By understanding what metric grouping is and how issues can arise, you can better understand how New Relic works with your application to group metrics effectively and help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring. Here is a \"before\" and \"after\" example of how metric grouping can help organize transactions, to help you more easily identify patterns with performance problems. To help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring in your app: Check the New Relic release notes to verify you're running the most current version of the New Relic agent. If needed, upgrade your APM/mobile/browser agent to the most current version. Wait a few minutes, then look at new data in the New Relic UI. If the problem persists, follow the procedures for your agent: Agent Preventing MGIs All agents Review the information about what causes metric grouping issues. Browser Add URL groupings. C SDK Avoid using URLs to name your transactions. Instead, follow the procedures to instrument your app with the C SDK. Go Rename your Go transactions. Java See Java metric grouping issues. .NET Rename metrics with SetTransactionName. For more information about using XML to add details, see Name transactions. Node.js Rename transactions with Request API calls. PHP Rename your PHP transactions. Python Rename your Python transactions with set_transaction_name. Ruby Rename your Ruby transactions.

      "body": "Some New Relic solutions require installation of an agent. The agent root directory is the main folder that holds the files for the agent. Typically, the agent root directory is the directory where the agent install process places the agent configuration file. You may need to find the agent root directory for several reasons: To customize your configuration file. To run New Relic Diagnostics. To install, update, or uninstall the agent. To troubleshoot if no data appears in the New Relic UI. Tip These strategies for finding the root directory are applicable if you followed the default install procedure. If you installed to a different directory, this information might not apply. APM agents The agent root directory depends on the agent you're using: C SDK The C SDK may not necessarily be installed in a single place, and it does not have an installation tool or script. The \"root directory\" depends on what the user does. In general, the root directory is the location of the libnewrelic.so or libnewrelic.a library file as well as the location of the libnewrelic.h file. Go agent The Go agent root directory is the root directory of your app, where you imported the go-agent package when you installed the Go agent. Java agent The Java agent root directory is called newrelic, which you created in your app server's root directory when you installed the Java agent. .NET Core 2.0 agent The location of the .NET Core 2.0 agent root directory depends on your system: System Location of the agent root directory Windows Look in the CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME environment variable for your application to find the location of the agent root directory. Linux The location of the agent root directory is /usr/local/newrelic-netcore20-agent. You can also look in the CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME environment variable for your application to find the location of the agent root directory. Docker In the root directory for your app, look for the agent root directory called NewRelic, which you created when you installed the Core 2.0 agent with Docker. .NET Framework agent The location of the .NET Framework agent root directory is C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\.NET Agent. Node.js agent The Node.js agent root directory is the root directory of your app, where you copied newrelic.js when you installed the Node.js agent. PHP agent The location of the PHP agent root directory depends on how you installed the agent: Installation method Root directory location With a package manager or tar archive Use phpinfo() and look in the sections called Scan this dir for additional .ini files or Additional .ini files parsed for the location of the newrelic.ini file. This file will be in the agent root directory, which is called newrelic-php5. Tip The PHP agent root directory is called newrelic-php5 for all supported PHP versions, including PHP 7. With a configuration system, like Puppet or Chef To find all of the locations where the PHP agent was installed, check the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable for a list of agent root directories. Python agent You can install the Python agent anywhere on your host system and then supply a path to it through the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable or the newrelic.agent.initialize() API call. To find the location of the agent config file, look in the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable or the newrelic.agent.initialize() call for the path to the agent root directory. Ruby agent The location of the Ruby agent root directory depends on how you installed the agent: Installation method Root directory location With the newrelic_rpm gem The Ruby agent root directory is in the root directory of your app in a directory called config. Without the gem Look in the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH environment variable for the path to the agent root directory. If there isn't a path in that environment variable, check the following directories to find the one that contains the newrelic.yml file: config $HOME/.newrelic/ $HOME/ Mobile agent The mobile agent root directory is the root directory of your app. Infrastructure agent The location of the infrastructure agent root directory depends on your system: Infrastructure agent System Root directory location Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\ Linux, Docker, and Elastic Beanstalk /etc On-host integrations The location of the root directory for on-host integrations is /etc. Cloud integrations Because cloud integrations are not installed but are connected to our infrastructure monitoring through your cloud service provider, there is not a root directory specific to cloud integrations.

      "body": "Problem For our APM, browser monitoring, and mobile monitoring features, there can be cases when an account or application is sending many individual metrics that could be better managed by grouping them together. We use the term metric grouping issue or MGI to describe this situation. When this occurs, the agent is sending unnecessarily large amounts of data to New Relic, which reduces the effectiveness of New Relic charts, tables, and reports. Metric grouping issues occur most commonly with web transactions, especially if the name is based on URLs. They can also happen with other metrics reported by your application. For example: If your application is crawling the Internet and each external call goes to a different domain If your software dynamically generates temporary database tables every time you receive a request If you are using custom instrumentation that includes UUIDs, article names, or similar unique components Any situation where a potentially infinite list of metrics can be created, rather than metrics being grouped effectively (as with controllers, permanent database tables, or specific external services) can become a metric grouping issue. Solution By understanding what metric grouping is and how issues can arise, you can better understand how New Relic works with your application to group metrics effectively and help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring. Here is a \"before\" and \"after\" example of how metric grouping can help organize transactions, to help you more easily identify patterns with performance problems. To help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring in your app: Check the New Relic release notes to verify you're running the most current version of the New Relic agent. If needed, upgrade your APM/mobile/browser agent to the most current version. Wait a few minutes, then look at new data in the New Relic UI. If the problem persists, follow the procedures for your agent: Agent Preventing MGIs All agents Review the information about what causes metric grouping issues. Browser Add URL groupings. C SDK Avoid using URLs to name your transactions. Instead, follow the procedures to instrument your app with the C SDK. Go Rename your Go transactions. Java See Java metric grouping issues. .NET Rename metrics with SetTransactionName. For more information about using XML to add details, see Name transactions. Node.js Rename transactions with Request API calls. PHP Rename your PHP transactions. Python Rename your Python transactions with set_transaction_name. Ruby Rename your Ruby transactions. Cause Metric grouping issues occur when the granularity of metric names (most often web transaction names) is too fine, resulting in hundreds or thousands of different web transaction names for just a small number of code paths. A few major code paths may generate many different full URL paths to unique documents, articles, or page, etc., and if the unique element of the URL path is included in the transaction name, each of these common paths will have its own unique name. MGI example In this example, you have an application that lets users write articles on any subject and post them for other users to see. Your application has three main functions: add an article, search for an article, and display an article. In order to improve search engine optimization (SEO), the \"view article\" code generates a unique URL to refer to each article. For example, the following URLs each refer to different articles in the example website: http://example.com/article/view/How_to_Install_New_Relic http://example.com/article/view/How_New_Relic_Saved_the_Day http://example.com/article/view/Where_do_I_get_New_Relic Copy All three articles are different; they contain different content and their URLs are different. However, the code path that generates each article is the same: they all use the \"view article\" function. Many web frameworks use this technique. They have a controller or route (in this case named article/view) as part of the URL. New Relic works to automatically identify these patterns and group similar routes together, to prevent metric grouping issues from occurring. Without mechanisms for detecting controllers, the example application would send metrics for each individual URL requested by visitors to your site. If you have a million articles and your site is popular, in each minute there could be several thousand unique URLs visited. This produces a significant amount of additional data to be sent to New Relic for each harvest cycle, and the APM Transactions page would attempt to list thousands of unique URLs, resulting in metric grouping issues. To monitor and improve your application performance, it's much more useful to know the average performance for a function (for example, viewing articles on your site) than how quickly each individual article is displayed. To prevent metric grouping issues, New Relic will normally show a single entry for that function (for example, /article/view/*) on the APM Transactions page. This grouping gives you a much better idea of how much time was spent viewing articles, and allows you to easily spot any performance problems related to viewing articles. If these statistics were spread across hundreds or thousands of transactions, detecting trends, regressions, or performance improvements would be extremely difficult. Each APM agent has distinct ways of detecting controllers and frameworks. Most are automatic, but a few require you to enable or disable options in a config file. You can also follow our recommendations to help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring.",

      "body": "Applications are automatically removed from New Relic after 93 days without sending data to our platform. You can also remove an application using the UI, once it has stopped sending data. Key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API, with the application name remaining reserved. For more information, see Inactive apps in New Relic One and our data retention guidelines. Before attempting to remove an app Before attempting to remove an APM, browser, or mobile app from the New Relic UI, keep in mind: You can downgrade your account to pay less or make it entirely free. To remove an app, you must have a user role with that capability. If an agent is still sending data from an app, you cannot remove an app. Remove an application from New Relic Before removing an APM, browser, or mobile application from New Relic, stop the application from sending data either by disabling the agent or by uninstalling it completely. APM applications Disable the APM agent: C SDK: Do a quick recompile and deploy. For example, surround your instrumentation in #ifdef, and set the value of YOURNAMESPACE_NEWRELIC_ENABLED with your build system. Go: Set Enabled to false. Java: Set agent_enabled to false. .NET: Set Newrelic.AgentEnabled to false. Node.js: Set agent_enabled to false. PHP: Remove or disable both the newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon components. Set newrelic.enabled to false. Python: Set monitor_mode to false. Ruby: Set agent_enabled to false. Restart the application server and wait up to ten minutes. Verify the color-coded health status for the app has turned to gray and is no longer reporting data. To remove the APM application and any browser applications linked to it, you have two options: Click the Delete application button on the APM application/service's Settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app/service) > Settings > Application. Or, call the /applications/delete endpoint of the New Relic REST API. For example: curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID.json' \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:YOUR_API_KEY' -i Copy Browser If you've used the copy/paste method to install the browser agent, remove the JavaScript snippet from your application's pages. After 93 days, the application will be removed from New Relic. Tip If browser data continues to be reported, see our suggestions below. Once your browser application has stopped reporting, you have two ways to remove it: If your browser application is linked to an APM application, deleting the APM application also removes the browser application. See the instructions for deleting an APM application/service above for details. Or, click the Delete application button on the browser application's Application settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings . Mobile Remove all references/dependencies to the New Relic's mobile SDK/frameworks, then rebuild the application. For more information, see the iOS and Android install docs. After 93 days, the application will be removed from New Relic. Or, once your mobile application has stopped reporting, you can also remove it manually: Click the Delete application button on the mobile application's Settings page. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Application . Troubleshooting If you have problems removing an app, here are some possible causes and suggested solutions: You are not an admin on your full user account If you don't have proper permissions, you won't be able to remove an application. You have not waited long enough All app data must stop reporting to New Relic before you can remove that entity from New Relic. In most cases, this takes between 10-15 minutes. In rare cases, it can take a few minutes longer. Not all agents are disabled If you have multiple agents reporting data under the same UI name, then you must make sure you disable or uninstall all of the agents associated with that entity. You have problems removing your PHP app If you have a PHP app and aren't able to remove it from the UI, possible causes include: You have not disabled both components of the PHP agent. You must stop or uninstall both newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon in order to be able to remove a PHP app. For more information, see New Relic daemon processes. You have set up per-directory monitoring of your PHP app, and unexpected PHP data is reporting as the default PHP application in the New Relic UI. To fix this, change the default app name in the PHP agent config. You don't know where the app's data is coming from If you don't know where an app's data is coming from, it may be because the app's name has been changed. When an app name is changed in the UI, it does not change the underlying app name being reported; it only changes how the app name appears in the UI. To see if there is a difference between the reported name and the displayed name: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. Scroll down to Settings and select Application. Compare the name in the Application alias field to the name in the Your application still reports as message directly beneath it. To get host information about an app you are not familiar with: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. From the summary view, review the Servers list. Once you have identified where app data is coming from, you can remove the app from New Relic. Browser data is still reporting To remove an app from New Relic, all data must have stopped reporting, including browser monitoring data. To verify that you have disabled or uninstalled the APM agent associated with the app: Ensure that browser monitoring is disabled. If your browser monitoring script is inserted by the APM agent, turn it off from inside the UI, in the agent's config file, or in both. If you copied and pasted the monitoring JavaScript snippet in certain pages, remove that JavaScript snippet manually. Ensure all caches have been cleared that the application uses, such as host caches, CDNs, or anything else that caches built pages. Optional: To see a count of how many page views report from each domain, use this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView WHERE appName = 'YOUR_BROWSER_APP_NAME' FACET domain Copy If these steps don't resolve the issue, it is likely due to an end-user's browser cache that hasn't yet cleared. Wait until those caches clear. If your app has internal users, you may be able to identify the users and clear those caches. For more help",

      "body": "Request queuing occurs before the request reaches your application (where the agent resides). This is why you need to do some straightforward configuration of the agent and your production hosts to take advantage of this feature. HTTP header In order to report request queuing, most New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). You can configure these front-end servers to set the timestamp in the HTTP header that represents when the request first entered your production infrastructure. Tip Set this header as soon after the request enters your infrastructure as possible so that you are less likely to miss performance problems in your infrastructure that occur before the header is set. Most New Relic agents will interpret an X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start header and use it to calculate Request Queuing. The agents treat these headers identically. Include a value in the format t=MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH where MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH is an integer value of the number of microseconds that have elapsed since the beginning of the Unix epoch (for example, January 1, 1970). Nearly any front-end HTTP server or load balancer can be configured to add this header. Additional details depend on your specific agent and server configuration. For more information, see the request queue configuration examples. C SDK The C SDK does not support request queuing. Go agent With the Go agent, set either header to record a metric for it. Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby agents The most recent versions of the Java, Node.js, Python, and Ruby agents provide more flexibility in the format of the X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header. These agents allow the timestamp to be submitted in seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds as an integer or floating point value. These agents also allow the leading t= in the header value to be omitted. Based on the order of magnitude, these agents automatically interpret the time unit as seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds. New Relic can do this reliably since a millisecond timestamp, interpreted as microseconds, would result in a queue time over 40 years. Python agent only: When using Apache/mod_wsgi 3.4 or higher, mod_wsgi will automatically insert an equivalent to the X-Queue-Start header into the WSGI environ dictionary for each request. This will mark the specific point in time where Apache first accepted the request. The value set by mod_wsgi will be picked up and used by the Python agent if no separate X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header has been manually configured into a web server's front end or in Apache itself. .NET agent The .NET agent does not require (and will ignore) any configuration of HTTP headers to calculate queue time. It works by instrumenting the IIS-queuing mechanism directly and reports queue time as the difference between when the HttpContext constructor executes and when the HttpApplication.BeginRequest event fires. Request queue time is only reported for .NET Framework applications hosted on IIS (for example: ASP.NET applications). It is not reported for ASP .NET Core applications (targeting .NET Core or Framework), nor for self-hosted OWIN applications. PHP agent The PHP agent only supports the X-Request-Start header. This identifies the timestamp in microseconds as an integer, with an optional t= in the header value. To ensure that the header is read properly, check your phpinfo() under the PHP Variables section, and verify that _SERVER[\"HTTP_X_REQUEST_START\"] exists and is in the expected format. If you are using Nginx, see Request queue server configuration examples for additional information on setting the header.",

      "body": "In order to report request queuing, New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). These examples use the X-Request-Start header, since it is has broader support across platforms. If this does not work with your server configuration for request queuing, try using the X-Queue-Start header. The syntax should otherwise be the same. Apache Apache's mod_headers module includes a %t variable that is formatted correctly. To enable request queue reporting, add this code to your Apache config: RequestHeader set X-Request-Start \"%t\" Copy Nginx If you are using Nginx version 1.2.6 or higher and the latest version of the Ruby, Python, or PHP agent, Nginx can easily be configured to report queue time. (For Nginx versions 1.2.6 or lower, you must recompile Nginx with a module or patch.) Configuring with Nginx 1.2.6 or higher uses the ${msec} variable, which is a number in seconds with milliseconds resolution. For more information, see http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#variables. Add the appropriate information to your Nginx config: Nginx configuration Values General Nginx use proxy_set_header X-Request-Start \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Passenger Version 5 or higher: >passenger_set_header X-REQUEST-START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Older versions: passenger_set_cgi_param X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy fastcgi fastcgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy uWSGI uwsgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy F5 load balancers For F5 load balancers, use this configuration snippet: when HTTP_REQUEST_SEND { # TCL 8.4 so we have to calculate the time in millisecond resolution # Calculation from: https://groups.google.com/forum/? fromgroups=#!topic/comp.lang.tcl/tV9H6TDv0t8 set secs [clock seconds] set ms [clock clicks -milliseconds] set base [expr { $secs * 1000 }] set fract [expr { $ms - $base }] if { $fract >= 1000 } { set diff [expr { $fract / 1000 }] incr secs $diff incr fract [expr { -1000 * $diff }] } set micros [format \"%d%03d000\" $secs $fract] # Want this header inserted as if coming from the client clientside { HTTP::header insert X-Request-Start \"t=${micros}\" } } Copy Network timing Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time in your Browser data. This is because the front-end server does not add the queuing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. The queuing time headers can never account for backlog in the listener socket used to accept requests. For example, if the front-end server's configuration results in a backlog of requests that queue in the listener socket, page load timing will show an increase in network time.",

Depending on the specifics of your production systems, this measurement of time may or may not include an actual queue that requests enter. It may also represent other functions (such as load balancing or internal network latency). Use request queuing to identify scaling problems Tracking time spent in request queuing is useful for identifying certain types of performance and scaling problems; for example: When your front-end web server is spending time waiting for application workers to become available When extra time is spent warming up application workers after a deploy or restart You must configure your New Relic agent and server to report request queuing. Then the information will appear in the selected application's Requests time chart for web transactions (from APM's Applications list, select the app), as well as other places in the user interface. The chart's legend indicates which color represents request queueing. Apdex calculations Request queuing is the time from when the browser requests content to the time it receives the content. Since your Apdex score will reflect these calculations, you can select whether to report request queue time separately or not. For more information, see Agent configuration. Clock skew If the front-end web server (such as Nginx) and your application do not reside on the same physical server, reported request queuing may be affected by clock skew. NTP provides an excellent way to keep server clocks in sync. However, they still will drift relative to each other. Since New Relic agents rely on a timestamp set by the front-end server, it may over- or under-report request queuing if the clock on that server is not closely synchronized with the clock on the app server. This may seem like a major problem with the feature; however, clock skew is unlikely to result in sudden spikes in reported request queuing. Sudden spikes generally occur when an app is restarted or becomes overloaded with requests. Our experience is that request queue reporting can be useful to identify real performance problems, but be sure to consider clock skew when interpreting this data.",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "There may be cases where an application sends many individual metrics that could be better managed in groups. Most of these occur with web transactions metrics named from URLs. For more information on this issue, see Metric grouping issues (MGIs). To reduce high cardinality and prevent metric grouping issues, New Relic supports rules for grouping or filtering out metrics (normalization). In some cases, when MGIs with a significant high number of metrics are detected, a rule is created automatically to protect the platform from performance degradation. Metric normalization rules management You can create and manage new rules that deal with the noise produced from high cardinality metrics by using the metric normalization tool, which is accessible from each service dashboard in the New Relic Explorer. Once there, select Metric Normalization in the left sidebar. There you can see the existing rules or create new ones. Click a rule to modify it, or click Create a new rule to create a new one. A new pane to configure the rule will be displayed. Available fields are: Match expression: enter the regular expression to group all the metrics you want to include in the rule. Matches: here you will see a preview of the metrics matched by the regular expression above. Action: the action you want to perform on the metrics. Replace: replace the matched metrics by the regular expression with the value described in the Replacement field. Ignore: ignore any metric that matches the regular expression. Deny new metrics: only write metrics that have already been reported, and ignore those that match the regular expression. Replacement: only active when Replace is enabled. Matched metrics are replaced with the field's value. If the regular expression is capturing groups, you can use placeholders for them with \\1 or \\2 for the groups 1 and 2 respectively. Active: rules can’t be deleted, but can be deactivated. Click the toggle to enable or disable the rule. If you want the rule to be removed, reach out to New Relic's support. Notes: internal notes on the rule. Has no effect on the rule. Once you have set up the fields, click Create (or Edit in case you are editing an existing rule), and the rule will be applied immediately as long as it's Active.",

The account dropdown on the right gets you to your account settings. To access your account settings, in the top right, click your profile icon for all your account-related abilities. In the top left, use the All accounts dropdown menu to switch accounts. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation function You can use NRQL query function, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, with the Browser agent, with the Mobile agent, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure Monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, Infrastructure Monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights At New Relic, Insights used to be the primary way to query and chart your New Relic-reported data. Now, we have the improved query builder. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our Mobile Monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account A master account is a New Relic account that has one or more subordinate accounts (sub-accounts). For details, see Account structure. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, Mobile Monitoring, and Browser Monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile Monitoring Mobile Monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile Monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our Full Stack Observability pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "New Relic's global data hosting structure consists of two regions: the European Union (EU) region and the United States (US) region. Selecting your preferred region during the account setup process allows you to specify the region where your performance monitoring data will be hosted. You can also create accounts in each region. Requirements Access to the New Relic EU region requires the latest agent version. For new customers: Install the most recent agent version. For existing customers: Update to the most recent agent version. Minimum agent version required: C SDK 1.0.0 or higher Go 2.0.0 or higher Java 4.0.0 or higher .NET 8.0.0 or higher Node.js 3.0.0 or higher PHP 8.0.0.204 or higher Python 3.0.0.89 or higher Ruby 5.0.0.342 or higher Regions and availability Your choice of data center is not limited by your geographic location. You can choose to create an account with data hosted in either the EU or US region, regardless of where you or your systems reside. You can also create accounts in each region. New Relic offers almost all the same active products, features, support offerings, and performance levels in the EU region as what is offered in the US region. Exceptions: The following are not supported with an EU region account: Infinite Tracing is not available. APM's weekly performance reports are not available. The Plugins product is unavailable and is not supported. Deprecated products and features are not available. New Relic's Incident Intelligence service operates solely in the U.S. Whether you store your data in New Relic’s US region data center or New Relic’s EU region data center, by using New Relic Incident Intelligence, you consent that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in, the US region. Regions and account hierarchy You can create accounts in each region. If your data is currently being hosted in the US region, you must create a new account to store data in the EU region. You cannot view EU data from a US account, or US data from an EU account. The data collected remains separate. The data cannot be aggregated or migrated between accounts. For standard accounts, you can only have one master account. For more information, see Manage apps or users with sub-accounts. For partnership accounts, no changes to the partnership owner account are required. However, data cannot be shared across regions, so a partnership requires a master account for each region. Hierarchy example for partnership accounts With partnership accounts, a new master account must be created for any data to be host in the EU region. This hierarchy illustrates how global accounts are structured with partnership owner accounts. Data is not aggregated beyond the master account. Example hierarchy for partnership organizations. Because data cannot be shared across regions, a partnership will require a master account for each region. Create an EU region account To create a New Relic account in the EU region: Go to the New Relic signup page. OR If you have a specific offer from a New Relic partner, follow that link directly. Follow the online steps to create your account. From the Select your region dropdown, select European Union. Agree to the Terms of Service. When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account and sign in to New Relic. Then install or update to the most recent agent version. API endpoints for EU region accounts If you have an EU region account, use the appropriate endpoints to access the following New Relic APIs: API EU endpoint Browser source maps API sourcemaps.service. eu .newrelic.com Copy Infrastructure Alert API infra-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Dashboard API rpm. eu .newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/list Copy Insert API insights-collector. eu01 .nr-data.net Copy Insights Query API insights-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Mobile apps rpm. eu .newrelic.com/mobile Copy NerdGraph GraphiQL API api. eu .newrelic.com/graphiql Copy Partner API The partner API is a global API with no regional data differences. Use this endpoint for both EU and US accounts: rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/ Copy REST API api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Synthetics API synthetics. eu .newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Trace API trace-api. eu .newrelic.com/trace/v1 Copy Metric API metric-api. eu .newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Log API log-api. eu .newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Access New Relic One If your accounts report data to the EU data center, use the following link to go to New Relic One: one.eu.newrelic.com. Billing and pricing New Relic's account billing process and pricing options are the same for both the EU and US regions. Operational access and processing Customer Data is hosted in the region selected during account creation. Systems Operations Data is stored in the US region. All other information, including account information (such as license subscription information, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the EU region. New Relic may access and process Customer Data in the United States and such other jurisdictions where New Relic has affiliates and subsidiaries, including as may be necessary to maintain, secure, or perform the services, to provide technical support, or as necessary to comply with law or a binding order of a government body. Customer Data from existing New Relic accounts cannot be transferred or shared across regions, and new data generated cannot be shared with existing accounts, even in partnership accounts. Verify your account is based in EU region Use either of these options to verify whether your account data is hosted in the EU region's data center: In APM, mouse over the application name to view the URL. If it begins with rpm.eu.newrelic.com/, it is an EU-based account. Check your New Relic license key. If it begins with EU, it is an EU-based account.",

The account dropdown on the right gets you to your account settings. To access your account settings, in the top right, click your profile icon for all your account-related abilities. In the top left, use the All accounts dropdown menu to switch accounts. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation function You can use NRQL query function, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, with the Browser agent, with the Mobile agent, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure Monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, Infrastructure Monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights At New Relic, Insights used to be the primary way to query and chart your New Relic-reported data. Now, we have the improved query builder. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our Mobile Monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account A master account is a New Relic account that has one or more subordinate accounts (sub-accounts). For details, see Account structure. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, Mobile Monitoring, and Browser Monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile Monitoring Mobile Monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile Monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our Full Stack Observability pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "New Relic's global data hosting structure consists of two regions: the European Union (EU) region and the United States (US) region. Selecting your preferred region during the account setup process allows you to specify the region where your performance monitoring data will be hosted. You can also create accounts in each region. Requirements Access to the New Relic EU region requires the latest agent version. For new customers: Install the most recent agent version. For existing customers: Update to the most recent agent version. Minimum agent version required: C SDK 1.0.0 or higher Go 2.0.0 or higher Java 4.0.0 or higher .NET 8.0.0 or higher Node.js 3.0.0 or higher PHP 8.0.0.204 or higher Python 3.0.0.89 or higher Ruby 5.0.0.342 or higher Regions and availability Your choice of data center is not limited by your geographic location. You can choose to create an account with data hosted in either the EU or US region, regardless of where you or your systems reside. You can also create accounts in each region. New Relic offers almost all the same active products, features, support offerings, and performance levels in the EU region as what is offered in the US region. Exceptions: The following are not supported with an EU region account: Infinite Tracing is not available. APM's weekly performance reports are not available. The Plugins product is unavailable and is not supported. Deprecated products and features are not available. New Relic's Incident Intelligence service operates solely in the U.S. Whether you store your data in New Relic’s US region data center or New Relic’s EU region data center, by using New Relic Incident Intelligence, you consent that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in, the US region. Regions and account hierarchy You can create accounts in each region. If your data is currently being hosted in the US region, you must create a new account to store data in the EU region. You cannot view EU data from a US account, or US data from an EU account. The data collected remains separate. The data cannot be aggregated or migrated between accounts. For standard accounts, you can only have one master account. For more information, see Manage apps or users with sub-accounts. For partnership accounts, no changes to the partnership owner account are required. However, data cannot be shared across regions, so a partnership requires a master account for each region. Hierarchy example for partnership accounts With partnership accounts, a new master account must be created for any data to be host in the EU region. This hierarchy illustrates how global accounts are structured with partnership owner accounts. Data is not aggregated beyond the master account. Example hierarchy for partnership organizations. Because data cannot be shared across regions, a partnership will require a master account for each region. Create an EU region account To create a New Relic account in the EU region: Go to the New Relic signup page. OR If you have a specific offer from a New Relic partner, follow that link directly. Follow the online steps to create your account. From the Select your region dropdown, select European Union. Agree to the Terms of Service. When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account and sign in to New Relic. Then install or update to the most recent agent version. API endpoints for EU region accounts If you have an EU region account, use the appropriate endpoints to access the following New Relic APIs: API EU endpoint Browser source maps API sourcemaps.service. eu .newrelic.com Copy Infrastructure Alert API infra-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Dashboard API rpm. eu .newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/list Copy Insert API insights-collector. eu01 .nr-data.net Copy Insights Query API insights-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Mobile apps rpm. eu .newrelic.com/mobile Copy NerdGraph GraphiQL API api. eu .newrelic.com/graphiql Copy Partner API The partner API is a global API with no regional data differences. Use this endpoint for both EU and US accounts: rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/ Copy REST API api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Synthetics API synthetics. eu .newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Trace API trace-api. eu .newrelic.com/trace/v1 Copy Metric API metric-api. eu .newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Log API log-api. eu .newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Access New Relic One If your accounts report data to the EU data center, use the following link to go to New Relic One: one.eu.newrelic.com. Billing and pricing New Relic's account billing process and pricing options are the same for both the EU and US regions. Operational access and processing Customer Data is hosted in the region selected during account creation. Systems Operations Data is stored in the US region. All other information, including account information (such as license subscription information, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the EU region. New Relic may access and process Customer Data in the United States and such other jurisdictions where New Relic has affiliates and subsidiaries, including as may be necessary to maintain, secure, or perform the services, to provide technical support, or as necessary to comply with law or a binding order of a government body. Customer Data from existing New Relic accounts cannot be transferred or shared across regions, and new data generated cannot be shared with existing accounts, even in partnership accounts. Verify your account is based in EU region Use either of these options to verify whether your account data is hosted in the EU region's data center: In APM, mouse over the application name to view the URL. If it begins with rpm.eu.newrelic.com/, it is an EU-based account. Check your New Relic license key. If it begins with EU, it is an EU-based account.",

New Relic's Incident Intelligence service operates solely in the U.S. Whether you store your data in New Relic’s US region data center or New Relic’s EU region data center, by using New Relic Incident Intelligence, you consent that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in, the US region. Regions and account hierarchy You can create accounts in each region. If your data is currently being hosted in the US region, you must create a new account to store data in the EU region. You cannot view EU data from a US account, or US data from an EU account. The data collected remains separate. The data cannot be aggregated or migrated between accounts. For standard accounts, you can only have one master account. For more information, see Manage apps or users with sub-accounts. For partnership accounts, no changes to the partnership owner account are required. However, data cannot be shared across regions, so a partnership requires a master account for each region. Hierarchy example for partnership accounts With partnership accounts, a new master account must be created for any data to be host in the EU region. This hierarchy illustrates how global accounts are structured with partnership owner accounts. Data is not aggregated beyond the master account. Example hierarchy for partnership organizations. Because data cannot be shared across regions, a partnership will require a master account for each region. Create an EU region account To create a New Relic account in the EU region: Go to the New Relic signup page. OR If you have a specific offer from a New Relic partner, follow that link directly. Follow the online steps to create your account. From the Select your region dropdown, select European Union. Agree to the Terms of Service. When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account and sign in to New Relic. Then install or update to the most recent agent version. API endpoints for EU region accounts If you have an EU region account, use the appropriate endpoints to access the following New Relic APIs: API EU endpoint Browser source maps API sourcemaps.service. eu .newrelic.com Copy Infrastructure Alert API infra-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Dashboard API rpm. eu .newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/list Copy Insert API insights-collector. eu01 .nr-data.net Copy Insights Query API insights-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Mobile apps rpm. eu .newrelic.com/mobile Copy NerdGraph GraphiQL API api. eu .newrelic.com/graphiql Copy Partner API The partner API is a global API with no regional data differences. Use this endpoint for both EU and US accounts: rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/ Copy REST API api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Synthetics API synthetics. eu .newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Trace API trace-api. eu .newrelic.com/trace/v1 Copy Metric API metric-api. eu .newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Log API log-api. eu .newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Access New Relic One If your accounts report data to the EU data center, use the following link to go to New Relic One: one.eu.newrelic.com. Billing and pricing New Relic's account billing process and pricing options are the same for both the EU and US regions. Operational access and processing Customer Data is hosted in the region selected during account creation. Systems Operations Data is stored in the US region. All other information, including account information (such as license subscription information, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the EU region. New Relic may access and process Customer Data in the United States and such other jurisdictions where New Relic has affiliates and subsidiaries, including as may be necessary to maintain, secure, or perform the services, to provide technical support, or as necessary to comply with law or a binding order of a government body. Customer Data from existing New Relic accounts cannot be transferred or shared across regions, and new data generated cannot be shared with existing accounts, even in partnership accounts. Verify your account is based in EU region Use either of these options to verify whether your account data is hosted in the EU region's data center: In APM, mouse over the application name to view the URL. If it begins with rpm.eu.newrelic.com/, it is an EU-based account. Check your New Relic license key. If it begins with EU, it is an EU-based account.",

The account dropdown on the right gets you to your account settings. To access your account settings, in the top right, click your profile icon for all your account-related abilities. In the top left, use the All accounts dropdown menu to switch accounts. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation function You can use NRQL query function, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, with the Browser agent, with the Mobile agent, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure Monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, Infrastructure Monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights At New Relic, Insights used to be the primary way to query and chart your New Relic-reported data. Now, we have the improved query builder. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our Mobile Monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account A master account is a New Relic account that has one or more subordinate accounts (sub-accounts). For details, see Account structure. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, Mobile Monitoring, and Browser Monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile Monitoring Mobile Monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile Monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our Full Stack Observability pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "New Relic's global data hosting structure consists of two regions: the European Union (EU) region and the United States (US) region. Selecting your preferred region during the account setup process allows you to specify the region where your performance monitoring data will be hosted. You can also create accounts in each region. Requirements Access to the New Relic EU region requires the latest agent version. For new customers: Install the most recent agent version. For existing customers: Update to the most recent agent version. Minimum agent version required: C SDK 1.0.0 or higher Go 2.0.0 or higher Java 4.0.0 or higher .NET 8.0.0 or higher Node.js 3.0.0 or higher PHP 8.0.0.204 or higher Python 3.0.0.89 or higher Ruby 5.0.0.342 or higher Regions and availability Your choice of data center is not limited by your geographic location. You can choose to create an account with data hosted in either the EU or US region, regardless of where you or your systems reside. You can also create accounts in each region. New Relic offers almost all the same active products, features, support offerings, and performance levels in the EU region as what is offered in the US region. Exceptions: The following are not supported with an EU region account: Infinite Tracing is not available. APM's weekly performance reports are not available. The Plugins product is unavailable and is not supported. Deprecated products and features are not available. New Relic's Incident Intelligence service operates solely in the U.S. Whether you store your data in New Relic’s US region data center or New Relic’s EU region data center, by using New Relic Incident Intelligence, you consent that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in, the US region. Regions and account hierarchy You can create accounts in each region. If your data is currently being hosted in the US region, you must create a new account to store data in the EU region. You cannot view EU data from a US account, or US data from an EU account. The data collected remains separate. The data cannot be aggregated or migrated between accounts. For standard accounts, you can only have one master account. For more information, see Manage apps or users with sub-accounts. For partnership accounts, no changes to the partnership owner account are required. However, data cannot be shared across regions, so a partnership requires a master account for each region. Hierarchy example for partnership accounts With partnership accounts, a new master account must be created for any data to be host in the EU region. This hierarchy illustrates how global accounts are structured with partnership owner accounts. Data is not aggregated beyond the master account. Example hierarchy for partnership organizations. Because data cannot be shared across regions, a partnership will require a master account for each region. Create an EU region account To create a New Relic account in the EU region: Go to the New Relic signup page. OR If you have a specific offer from a New Relic partner, follow that link directly. Follow the online steps to create your account. From the Select your region dropdown, select European Union. Agree to the Terms of Service. When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account and sign in to New Relic. Then install or update to the most recent agent version. API endpoints for EU region accounts If you have an EU region account, use the appropriate endpoints to access the following New Relic APIs: API EU endpoint Browser source maps API sourcemaps.service. eu .newrelic.com Copy Infrastructure Alert API infra-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Dashboard API rpm. eu .newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/list Copy Insert API insights-collector. eu01 .nr-data.net Copy Insights Query API insights-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Mobile apps rpm. eu .newrelic.com/mobile Copy NerdGraph GraphiQL API api. eu .newrelic.com/graphiql Copy Partner API The partner API is a global API with no regional data differences. Use this endpoint for both EU and US accounts: rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/ Copy REST API api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Synthetics API synthetics. eu .newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Trace API trace-api. eu .newrelic.com/trace/v1 Copy Metric API metric-api. eu .newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Log API log-api. eu .newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Access New Relic One If your accounts report data to the EU data center, use the following link to go to New Relic One: one.eu.newrelic.com. Billing and pricing New Relic's account billing process and pricing options are the same for both the EU and US regions. Operational access and processing Customer Data is hosted in the region selected during account creation. Systems Operations Data is stored in the US region. All other information, including account information (such as license subscription information, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the EU region. New Relic may access and process Customer Data in the United States and such other jurisdictions where New Relic has affiliates and subsidiaries, including as may be necessary to maintain, secure, or perform the services, to provide technical support, or as necessary to comply with law or a binding order of a government body. Customer Data from existing New Relic accounts cannot be transferred or shared across regions, and new data generated cannot be shared with existing accounts, even in partnership accounts. Verify your account is based in EU region Use either of these options to verify whether your account data is hosted in the EU region's data center: In APM, mouse over the application name to view the URL. If it begins with rpm.eu.newrelic.com/, it is an EU-based account. Check your New Relic license key. If it begins with EU, it is an EU-based account.",

The account dropdown on the right gets you to your account settings. To access your account settings, in the top right, click your profile icon for all your account-related abilities. In the top left, use the All accounts dropdown menu to switch accounts. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation function You can use NRQL query function, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, with the Browser agent, with the Mobile agent, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure Monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, Infrastructure Monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights At New Relic, Insights used to be the primary way to query and chart your New Relic-reported data. Now, we have the improved query builder. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our Mobile Monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account A master account is a New Relic account that has one or more subordinate accounts (sub-accounts). For details, see Account structure. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, Mobile Monitoring, and Browser Monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile Monitoring Mobile Monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile Monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our Full Stack Observability pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

The account dropdown on the right gets you to your account settings. To access your account settings, in the top right, click your profile icon for all your account-related abilities. In the top left, use the All accounts dropdown menu to switch accounts. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation function You can use NRQL query function, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, with the Browser agent, with the Mobile agent, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure Monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, Infrastructure Monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights At New Relic, Insights used to be the primary way to query and chart your New Relic-reported data. Now, we have the improved query builder. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our Mobile Monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account A master account is a New Relic account that has one or more subordinate accounts (sub-accounts). For details, see Account structure. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, Mobile Monitoring, and Browser Monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile Monitoring Mobile Monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile Monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our Full Stack Observability pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "New Relic's global data hosting structure consists of two regions: the European Union (EU) region and the United States (US) region. Selecting your preferred region during the account setup process allows you to specify the region where your performance monitoring data will be hosted. You can also create accounts in each region. Requirements Access to the New Relic EU region requires the latest agent version. For new customers: Install the most recent agent version. For existing customers: Update to the most recent agent version. Minimum agent version required: C SDK 1.0.0 or higher Go 2.0.0 or higher Java 4.0.0 or higher .NET 8.0.0 or higher Node.js 3.0.0 or higher PHP 8.0.0.204 or higher Python 3.0.0.89 or higher Ruby 5.0.0.342 or higher Regions and availability Your choice of data center is not limited by your geographic location. You can choose to create an account with data hosted in either the EU or US region, regardless of where you or your systems reside. You can also create accounts in each region. New Relic offers almost all the same active products, features, support offerings, and performance levels in the EU region as what is offered in the US region. Exceptions: The following are not supported with an EU region account: Infinite Tracing is not available. APM's weekly performance reports are not available. The Plugins product is unavailable and is not supported. Deprecated products and features are not available. New Relic's Incident Intelligence service operates solely in the U.S. Whether you store your data in New Relic’s US region data center or New Relic’s EU region data center, by using New Relic Incident Intelligence, you consent that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in, the US region. Regions and account hierarchy You can create accounts in each region. If your data is currently being hosted in the US region, you must create a new account to store data in the EU region. You cannot view EU data from a US account, or US data from an EU account. The data collected remains separate. The data cannot be aggregated or migrated between accounts. For standard accounts, you can only have one master account. For more information, see Manage apps or users with sub-accounts. For partnership accounts, no changes to the partnership owner account are required. However, data cannot be shared across regions, so a partnership requires a master account for each region. Hierarchy example for partnership accounts With partnership accounts, a new master account must be created for any data to be host in the EU region. This hierarchy illustrates how global accounts are structured with partnership owner accounts. Data is not aggregated beyond the master account. Example hierarchy for partnership organizations. Because data cannot be shared across regions, a partnership will require a master account for each region. Create an EU region account To create a New Relic account in the EU region: Go to the New Relic signup page. OR If you have a specific offer from a New Relic partner, follow that link directly. Follow the online steps to create your account. From the Select your region dropdown, select European Union. Agree to the Terms of Service. When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account and sign in to New Relic. Then install or update to the most recent agent version. API endpoints for EU region accounts If you have an EU region account, use the appropriate endpoints to access the following New Relic APIs: API EU endpoint Browser source maps API sourcemaps.service. eu .newrelic.com Copy Infrastructure Alert API infra-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Dashboard API rpm. eu .newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/list Copy Insert API insights-collector. eu01 .nr-data.net Copy Insights Query API insights-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Mobile apps rpm. eu .newrelic.com/mobile Copy NerdGraph GraphiQL API api. eu .newrelic.com/graphiql Copy Partner API The partner API is a global API with no regional data differences. Use this endpoint for both EU and US accounts: rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/ Copy REST API api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Synthetics API synthetics. eu .newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Trace API trace-api. eu .newrelic.com/trace/v1 Copy Metric API metric-api. eu .newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Log API log-api. eu .newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Access New Relic One If your accounts report data to the EU data center, use the following link to go to New Relic One: one.eu.newrelic.com. Billing and pricing New Relic's account billing process and pricing options are the same for both the EU and US regions. Operational access and processing Customer Data is hosted in the region selected during account creation. Systems Operations Data is stored in the US region. All other information, including account information (such as license subscription information, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the EU region. New Relic may access and process Customer Data in the United States and such other jurisdictions where New Relic has affiliates and subsidiaries, including as may be necessary to maintain, secure, or perform the services, to provide technical support, or as necessary to comply with law or a binding order of a government body. Customer Data from existing New Relic accounts cannot be transferred or shared across regions, and new data generated cannot be shared with existing accounts, even in partnership accounts. Verify your account is based in EU region Use either of these options to verify whether your account data is hosted in the EU region's data center: In APM, mouse over the application name to view the URL. If it begins with rpm.eu.newrelic.com/, it is an EU-based account. Check your New Relic license key. If it begins with EU, it is an EU-based account.",

      "body": "A DevOps transformation requires a cultural shift so that teams can build new skills and motivations for the type of cross-team work required in a true DevOps practice. The transformation can be difficult when the people involved do not see the benefits of change as a clear objective. Service level objectives (SLOs) provide a powerful mechanism to codify the goals of a DevOps team in a way that can be measured and shared. They also provide clear boundaries on service expectations that help teams achieve greater velocity and freedom in experimenting with new approaches. This tutorial defines SLOs for successful service delivery objectives and utilize New Relic instrumentation to surface the current performance metrics relative to those objectives. Measurable SLOs and visibility into your current progress against those SLOs ensure that you will be able to properly assess future optimization efforts. Service level components An SLO is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI); for example: Average response time Response time percentile Application availability SLOs clarify a target value for SLIs; for example: Average response time should be less than 200 ms 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms Availability of the service should be 99.99% Logically group SLOs together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether or not the service is meeting expectations. For example, a helpful SLO for alerting purposes could be: 95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99% Copy Service level components Example values SLI (Indicator) HTTP status codes SLO (Objective) < 1% HTTP 500s over 30 days SLA (Agreement) For every additional .1% of HTTP 500s, 5% refund of total contract Resources Value stream mapping can be a useful exercise to work through before setting SLOs. Work with your teams to clarify key components of your service and the appropriate metrics. Use these inputs as starting points for this tutorial. In addition: Learn about SLOs, SLIs, and SLAs from the Google Cloud Platform blog. Learn how New Relic has applied SLOs and SLIs into its reliability practices form this SREcon18 Americas presentation (approximately 21 minutes). 1. Build an inventory of services requiring SLOs Start defining SLOs for your application by first taking an inventory of the services that your application provides to both your internal and external customers. Draft a list of services. Make the scope of services you consider as comprehensive as possible. Engage your team members and other stakeholders to validate the list for completeness. Segment your application stack to understand the potential components that might require SLOs. For example, most applications can be segmented as: Application (backend/microservices) Dependency services (such as the message queue) Database Website Underlying servers This example lists components that would benefit from SLOs: Customer type Component name Owner Language stack Operating system External Service 1 John D. Java RHEL 6 Internal Service 2 Jane A. .NET Win2003 R2 Internal ActiveMQ John D. Java AIX External Website Jane A. Classic ASP Win2000 Internal MS SQL Dave Z. n/a Win2003 R2 Building a definitive list of services that require an SLO can be challenging, because an application often consists of many endpoints with complex interdependencies. Begin your SLO journey with pragmatism. Start by defining a broader, simpler set of SLOs that are driven by what your customers care about most and what your team can control. As your teams better align around SLOs, you can then begin to fine-tune and add more complexity. 2. Research customer expectations for SLOs Once you have an inventory of services, begin to gather the information you need to define the SLOs for those services. Interviews with customers that depend on your services are often valuable for understanding service expectations. For example, to define SLOs for internal teams, New Relic, ask questions such as: If possible, can you broadly categorize the types of requests we can expect from you and your service? To what extent do you or your service depend on timely responses to requests? Are there requests for which response time is not critical? How does your service handle unavailable dependencies or data? What is the maximum amount of unavailable data that your service can handle? At what threshold does your service fail if a request takes too long? What are acceptable rates of errors? What would a SLA look like between our product and yours? Existing usage data can also be a helpful research input. 3. Define SLOs Using the research on customer expectations that you gathered, draft a focused set of SLOs. New Relic recommends setting SLOs against one or more of the following SLIs: Application availability percentage Average response time Response percentile Error rate Apdex value Also, consider instrumenting and tracking the following SLIs: Throughput (peak and trough) Database call count and duration DNS and SSL timing DOM processing and page rendering Mean-time-to-detection (MTTD) For a more comprehensive list of potential areas to measure, see Measuring DevOps. Recommendation: To determine if your application is performing to customer expectations: Consider combining multiple SLIs (for example, availability and response time) into one SLO. Aim to define a consistent set of conditions across all of the services in your list. Consult your team and stakeholders to validate that the SLOs you set are reasonable, consistently attainable (even if you are not currently meeting them), and aligned to customer expectations. After you finish this step, you should have a set of well-defined SLOs and SLIs. 4. Determine what can be instrumented Now you're ready to deploy agents or monitors to establish a performance baseline for the SLIs you created. With proper instrumentation in place, you'll have visibility into the performance indicators that matter for your team and your customers. In addition, you'll also have a clear understanding of how to meet your SLOs. Identify the service components your team will optimize. Verify which application tiers meet New Relic monitoring requirements. To ensure you have robust baselines from which to work, determine the level of instrumentation that is possible (or allowed) within your organization. It's best practice to instrument everything you can, but there may be situations where instrumentation isn't viable. In that case, you should determine what other data is available or can be created. For example, you can gather logs to query them for SLO data and set alerts for them. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Use the New Relic log management UI to leverage your logs. If the application has a web front end in these situations, use New Relic synthetic monitors. Our synthetic monitors offer non-agent monitoring while still providing the ability to establish a baseline. To instrument the example applications and components in this tutorial, use these New Relic features: New Relic products Customer type Component name Tier owner Language stack Server OS New Relic products External Service 1 John D. Java RHEL 6 APM, infrastructure monitoring, synthetic monitors Internal Service 2 Jane A. .Net Win2003 R2 APM, infrastructure monitoring Internal ActiveMQ John D. Java AIX APM External Website Jane A. Classic ASP Win2000 Synthetic monitors Internal MS SQL Dave Z. NA Win2003 R2 Infrastructure monitoring, on-host integrations APM installation After reviewing the compatibility and requirements for New Relic APM, install an APM agent on your application stack. Steps for installing APM agents vary based on language agent type. Follow the install procedures for a specific APM agents. Infrastructure installation After reviewing the requirements for New Relic infrastructure monitoring, follow the install procedures to install the infrastructure agent on instances that host your applications. The infrastructure agent requires the following host permissions: Linux: To install and run the agent, you must have root privileges. Windows: To install and run the agent, you must have Administrator privileges. Infrastructure on-host integrations To gain extended visibility into applications that your code depends on, deploy on-host integrations based on their availability. New Relic supports several commonly used application components, including MySQL, Apache, NGINX, and more. For more information, see our on-host integration docs. Synthetics New Relic synthetic monitoring gives you a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. Follow the procedures to create a simple browser check. Be sure to verify that your website URL is accessible from the Synthetics public network locations. Browser monitoring New Relic browser monitoring provides deep insights into how your users are interacting with your application or website. Browser monitoring complements synthetic monitors with data based on actual user experiences, which is useful in discerning how DevOps efforts are ultimately improving the experience for the customer. For more information, see the compatibility and requirements, then install the New Relic browser agent. Mobile monitoring The growing role of mobile apps in customer experience often spurs new performance data needs. Installation of New Relic mobile monitoring lets DevOps teams instrument iOS and Android applications to gain a fuller understanding of service delivery quality. 5. Review the default metrics After you deploy the agents and monitors, use service maps to review the default metrics that New Relic captures. For example, a typical service map show many of the common SLIs that application teams rely on, including response time, Apdex, throughput, and error rate metrics from APM. It also shows page load time, Ajax response, throughput, and error rate from browser monitoring. rpm.newrelic.com > Service maps: To explore detailed granularity for any area, use the service map's nodes. 6. Set up custom instrumentation To close any remaining gaps in visibility for your SLIs, use custom instrumentation. New Relic provides several avenues for adding custom instrumentation, including: Making API calls to agents from inside your source code Packaging XML-based custom instrumentation modules with deployed applications Adding UI-based instrumentation without a code deploy In addition, you can add custom attributes to each transaction event that match application performance factors to critical business information. Then you can track those attributes in Insights dashboards. For more information, see the custom instrumentation documentation for your application: APM Browser Infrastructure Insights Mobile Synthetics 7. Create dashboards to track SLIs Once you implement the appropriate instrumentation, it's easy to visualize your service level indicators with New Relic dashboards, which provide a single location to query and view all the data that New Relic tools gather. To learn more about how to run queries to produce charts and dashboards, see Introduction to chart builder. For more about the data you can query, see New Relic data types. The metrics you capture will become your application's baseline. Share dashboards with your application team and stakeholders to provide visibility into what is happening with your application and to monitor future performance.",

      "body": "In a DevOps world, a deep understanding of customer expectations and your progress in meeting those expectations is vital to providing stability, maintaining goodwill with your users, and increasing business value. With New Relic you can measure the success of your DevOps initiatives and learn how to identify, resolve, and decrease any gaps in your DevOps performance. In this tutorial, you’ll gather key service delivery stakeholders to assess your team's progress against service level objectives (SLOs) and service level agreements (SLAs), while facilitating further optimizations. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the Establish objectives and baseline tutorial. 1. Assemble a cross-functional team to review service delivery The first (and most important step) is assembling the right team. Identify the proper stakeholders and representatives to play active parts in the operations review process. This team should be comprised of individuals who develop applications, work with service delivery, maintain your ecosystem, and resolve problems for customers. While operations review teams often focus on technical members, the best teams have broad representation across the company, including representatives from Business Operations, Marketing, and Support. These cross-functional teams help ensure that the service delivery process is strongly integrated with customer expectations. If you can specifically identify how technical improvements meet customer expectations and positively impact the business’s bottom line, then your operations team is functioning at optimal levels. Tip Ideally, the cross-functional operations review team should also be the team that defines your SLOs. If this is not possible, try to ensure that some members of the operations review team are also on the team responsible for SLOs. 2. Review service records and note key metrics Create a regular meeting to track your service records. New Relic recommends reviewing your previous service records, and pinpointing specific metrics to analyze at every review. For example, start with application state, alert conditions, and runtime anomalies. Look at the same metrics on two separate occasions to identify and assess patterns, inconsistencies, and anomalies. Monitor these metrics using the service delivery Insights dashboards you created in the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. The widgets on these dashboards provide a high-level overview of the relationships between different performance indicators and baselines: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Use dashboards to visualize metrics related to service delivery. When conducting a thorough performance review, make several dashboards that have corresponding widgets. Use these dashboards to hone-in on two specific time periods that you want to compare. This comparative analysis could cover everything from Infrastructure or Browser performance, to Synthetics testing or business impact. To get started with performance indicators in Insights, read the following example queries. These queries provide information that you can consider incorporating for the operations review. Daily uptime SELECT percentage(count(result), where result = 'SUCCESS') from SyntheticCheck since 1 Day ago Copy Create dashboards that are dedicated to the functionality that drives your software development process, such as testing. For example, collect related metrics on uptime, types of monitors, geo-locations, and other data points that are required for appropriately measuring SLAs. The following dashboard provides such an example: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Track your relevant SLAs together in one dashboard. Device performance breakdown SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView FACET deviceType LIMIT 3 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Top URL performance SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView facet pageUrl SINCE 1 day ago limit 30 Copy Memory usage SELECT average(memoryUsedBytes) /1000000 AS 'Avg MB Used', average(memoryFreeBytes)/1000000 AS 'Avg MB Free', average(memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes)*100 as 'Memory used %' FROM SystemSample since 30 minutes ago Copy Server CPU SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample since 3 hours ago facet hostname limit 400 Copy Combine the results into a single dashboard to help drive decisions during your operations review. Dashboards that give a brief overview of performance across your entire application stack are invaluable for cross-functional team reviews. Tip Beyond Insights, the APM reports allow you to see how you’re performing on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis with built in SLA reports and other detailed reports. The out-of-the-box details from these reports give your operations team a launch pad for conversations about progress against objectives and overall performance. 3. Summarize events related to application alerts, downtime, and errors Now that you’ve gathered data about your service delivery, the next step is to dive deeper into specific incidents that warrant further investigation or surface a need for broader team action. For example, notable downtime and errors are key areas to investigate as a team. After completing the Setup proactive alerting tutorial, you can explore notifications of violations as they occur. Once these violations are brought to your attention, acknowledge the specific incident and have an ongoing record of both opened and closed incidents. Use the incident reports as a focal point for discussion of gaps. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents: Identify performance issues and SLA gaps with New Relic Alerts incident reports. Ultimately, it’s important to solicit feedback from the cross-functional team on the causes of the incidents to determine how you can improve service delivery processes to prevent reoccurrences. One approach might be to focus on one or two notable incidents, use the New Relic UI to walk through the data points leading up to those incidents, and assess the actions that occurred. Summarize the incident and the cross-functional feedback on causes and potential solutions as succinctly as possible. Over time, you’ll notice patterns that will require deeper action. 4. Create follow-up tracking tickets With built-in or customizable integrations with ServiceNow and other common ticketing systems, New Relic helps you follow up on anomalies and performance shortfalls as they arise. Add the information provided by New Relic to the tracking system, and ensure that the team charged with solving the problem has all of the details they need to track down and resolve the issue.",

      "body": "From a New Relic perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything New Relic can identify that has data you can monitor. Integrations can be configured to create their own entity, called a remote entity, by setting the remote_monitoring option to true. If set to false, an integration will be considered a local entity, and the data related to it will be attached to the host entity that the agent creates. Remote monitoring requires infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher. For the Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, and Redis integrations, remote monitoring (and multi-tenancy) is enabled by activating the configuration parameter remote_monitoring. Important If your Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, or Redis service is located in the same host as the agent, when you activate remote monitoring the resulting entity will be considered as remote, regardless of its actual location. This may affect alerts, alter attributes, and have other effects, as explained here. Effects of activating remote_monitoring By enabling remote_monitoring, the integration becomes a different entity which is no longer attached to the infrastructure agent. As a result, the following items may be affected: Alert verification Enabling remote monitoring can affect your configured alerts in case they are using any of the values that are affected by this new feature. We strongly recommend checking your existing alerts to make sure they keep on working as expected.

If the nricluster name or nriservice are defined in the integration configuration file, they will also be decorated. Unrecorded attributes Since the integration is now an independent entity which is not attached to the agent, the following agent attributes are not collected: agentName agentVersion coreCount criticalViolationCount fullHostname instanceType kernelVersion linuxDistribution entityType operatingSystem processorCount systemMemoryBytes warningViolationCount Your custom attributes Updated hostname For the ApacheSample, RedisSample, CassandraSample, and NginxSample integration metrics, we will use the integration configuration hostname instead of the short hostname from the agent.

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration The Apache integration configuration is how you can set required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. Configuration options include: metrics: This command captures the metrics of a particular Apache server. This takes a single argument: status_url: The URL set up to provide the metrics using the Apache status info module. Default value: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto. If you have customized your setup to use a different endpoint, you will need to set this value. inventory: This command captures the modules loaded by Apache as inventory data, using Apache's binary file. To disable the collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file. status_url: The URL is used to attach the inventory data to the same Apache instance for which we collect metrics data. labels: The env label controls the environment attribute. The default value is production. For more about general configuration structure, see Configuration. Activate remote monitoring The remote_monitoring parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Important Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use remote_monitoring. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the Apache status info module. Type String Default http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto Example: STATUS_URL='http://your.ip.address:8080/server-status?auto' Copy CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative file to use for custom SSL certificate. Type String Default (none) Example: CA_BUNDLE_FILE='/etc/ssl/certs/custom-ca.crt' Copy CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative path to use to find SSL certificate bundle file. Type String Default (none) Example: CA_BUNDLE_DIR='/etc/ssl/certs/custom/' Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

      "body": "Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. Config options include: metrics: This command captures the metrics of a particular NGINX server. Arguments: status_url: The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. If the default value of 127.0.0.1 is incorrect, substitute the address/FQDN/URL for your system. Example: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status Copy inventory: This command captures the configuration parameters set in the NGINX config file as inventory data. Arguments: config_path: The path to the NGINX configuration file. status_url: The URL is used to attach inventory data to the same NGINX instance for which we collect metrics. To disable inventory data collection, remove the inventory command. Important When running in a container, to retrieve inventory data you need to map the local config_path into the container, otherwise the integration terminates. See instructions for Docker on how to map volumes to share files between the host and the container. For Kubernetes, ECS, and potentially other environments where you can have more than one instance running, inventory is complex to configure. We strongly suggest disabling inventory in this case. labels: The env label controls the environment attribute. The default value is production. Activate remote monitoring You can use the remote_monitoring configuration parameter to enable remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration. You must also have infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher to use remote_monitoring. Important Activating remote_monitoring may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see remote monitoring in on-host integrations. Environment variable passthroughs Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. Type String Default http://127.0.0.1/status Example: STATUS_URL='http://your.ip.address:8080/status' Copy CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. Type String Default /etc/nginx/nginx.conf Example: CONFIG_PATH='/etc/nginx/custom/mynginx.conf' Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX.

      "body": "You can surface Kubernetes metadata and link it to your APM agents as distributed traces to explore performance issues and troubleshoot transaction errors. For more information, see this New Relic blog post. You can quickly start monitoring Kubernetes clusters using Auto-telemetry with Pixie, which is currently a beta release. This Pixie integration into New Relic does not require a language agent. Learn more about Auto-telemetry with Pixie here. Tip Our Kubernetes metadata injection project is open source. Here's the code to link APM and infrastructure data and the code to automatically manage certificates. Compatibility and requirements Before linking Kubernetes metadata to your APM agents, make sure you meet the following requirements: Kubernetes requirements Network requirements APM agent compatibility OpenShift requirements Kubernetes requirements To link your applications and Kubernetes, your cluster must have the MutatingAdmissionWebhook controller enabled, which requires Kubernetes 1.9 or higher. To verify that your cluster is compatible, run the following command: kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 Copy If you see a different result, follow the Kubernetes documentation to enable admission control in your cluster. Network requirements For Kubernetes to speak to our MutatingAdmissionWebhook, the master node (or the API server container, depending on how the cluster is set up) should be allowed egress for HTTPS traffic on port 443 to pods in all of the other nodes in the cluster. This might require specific configuration depending on how the infrastructure is set up (on-premises, AWS, Google Cloud, etc). Tip Until Kubernetes v1.14, users were only allowed to register admission webhooks on port 443. Since v1.15 it's possible to register them on different ports. To ensure backward compatibility, the webhook is registered by default on port 443 in the YAML config file we distribute. APM agent compatibility The following New Relic agents collect Kubernetes metadata: Go 2.3.0 or higher Java 4.10.0 or higher Node.js 5.3.0 or higher Python 4.14.0 or higher Ruby 6.1.0 or higher .NET 8.17.438 or higher Openshift requirements To link Openshift and Kubernetes you must enable mutating admission webhooks, which requires Openshift 3.9 or higher. During the process, install a resource that requires admin permissions to the cluster. Run this to log in as admin: oc login -u system:admin Copy Check that webhooks are correctly configured. If they are not, update the master-config.yaml file. admissionConfig: pluginConfig: MutatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission ValidatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission location: \"\" Copy Important Add kubeConfigFile: /dev/null to address some issues in Openshift. Enable certificate signing by editing the YAML file and updating your configuration: kubernetesMasterConfig: controllerArguments: cluster-signing-cert-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.crt\" cluster-signing-key-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.key\" Copy Restart the Openshift services in the master node. Configure the injection of metadata By default, all the pods you create that include APM agents have the correct environment variables set and the metadata injection applies to the entire cluster. To check that the environment variables have been set, any container that is running must be stopped, and a new instance started (see Validate the injection of metadata). This default configuration also uses the Kubernetes certificates API to automatically manage the certificates required for the injection. If needed, you can limit the injection of metadata to specific namespaces in your cluster or self-manage your certificates. Default configuration To proceed with the default injection of metadata, follow these steps: Download the YAML file: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Custom configuration You can limit the injection of metadata only to specific namespaces by using labels. To enable this feature, edit your YAML file by finding and uncommenting the following lines: # namespaceSelector: # matchLabels: # newrelic-metadata-injection: enabled Copy With this option, injection is only applied to those namespaces that have the newrelic-metadata-injection label set to enabled: kubectl label namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE newrelic-metadata-injection=enabled Copy Manage custom certificates To use custom certificates you need a specific YAML file: Download the YAML file without automatic certificate management: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Once you have the correct YAML file, you can proceed with the custom certificate management option. You need your certificate, server key, and Certification Authority (CA) bundle encoded in PEM format. If you have them in the standard certificate format (X.509), install openssl, and run the following: openssl x509 -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out CERTIFICATE_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in SERVER_KEY_FILENAME -outform PEM -out SERVER_KEY_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in CA_BUNDLE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out BUNDLE_FILENAME.pem Copy If your certificate/key pair are in another format, see the Digicert knowledgebase for more help. Create the TLS secret with the signed certificate/key pair, and patch the mutating webhook configuration with the CA using the following commands: kubectl create secret tls newrelic-metadata-injection-secret \\ --key=PEM_ENCODED_SERVER_KEY \\ --cert=PEM_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE \\ --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl -n default apply -f - caBundle=$(cat PEM_ENCODED_CA_BUNDLE | base64 | td -d '\\n') kubectl patch mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg --type='json' -p \"[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle', 'value':'${caBundle}'}]\" Copy Important Certificates signed by Kubernetes have an expiration of one year. For more information, see the Kubernetes source code in GitHub. Validate the injection of metadata In order to validate that the webhook (responsible for injecting the metadata) was installed correctly, deploy a new pod and check for the New Relic environment variables. Create a dummy pod containing Busybox by running: kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Check if New Relic environment variables were injected: kubectl exec busybox0 -- env | grep NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME=fsi NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME=nodea NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME=default NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME=busybox0 NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME=busybox Copy Disable the injection of metadata To disable/uninstall the injection of metadata, use the following commands: Delete the Kubernetes objects using the yaml file: kubectl delete -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Delete the TLS secret containing the certificate/key pair: kubectl delete secret/newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Troubleshooting Follow these troubleshooting tips as needed. No Kubernetes metadata in APM or distributed tracing transactions Problem The creation of the secret by the k8s-webhook-cert-manager job used to fail due to the kubectl version used by the image when running in Kubernetes version 1.19.x, The new version 1.3.2 fixes this issue, therefore it is enough to run again the job using an update version of the image to fix the issue. Solution Update the image k8s-webhook-cert-manager (to a version >= 1.3.2) and re-run the job. The secret will be correctly created and the k8s-metadata-injection pod will be able to start. Note that the new version of the manifest and of the nri-bundle are already updated with the correct version of the image. Problem In OpenShift version 4.x, the CA that is used in order to patch the mutatingwebhookconfiguration resource is not the one used when signing the certificates. This is a known issue currently tracked here. In the logs of the Pod nri-metadata-injection, you'll see the following error message: TLS handshake error from 10.131.0.29:37428: remote error: tls: unknown certificate authority TLS handshake error from 10.129.0.1:49314: remote error: tls: bad certificate Copy Workaround Manually update the certificate stored in the mutatingwebhookconfiguration object. The correct CA locations might change according to the cluster configuration. However, you can usually find the CA in the secret csr-signer in the namespace openshift-kube-controller-manager. Problem There is no Kubernetes metadata included in the transactions' attributes of your APM agent or in distributed tracing. Solution Verify that the environment variables are being correctly injected by following the instructions described in the Validate your installation step. If they are not present, get the name of the metadata injection pod by running: kubectl get pods | grep newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment kubectl logs -f pod/podname Copy In another terminal, create a new pod (for example, see Validate your installation), and inspect the logs of the metadata injection deployment for errors. For every created pod there should be a set of 4 new entries in the logs like: {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.107Z\",\"caller\":\"server/main.go:139\",\"msg\":\"POST https://newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default.svc:443/mutate?timeout=30s HTTP/2.0\\\" from 10.11.49.2:32836\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.110Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:168\",\"msg\":\"received admission review\",\"kind\":\"/v1, Kind=Pod\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"name\":\"\",\"pod\":\"busybox1\",\"UID\":\"6577519b-7a61-11ea-965e-0e46d1c9335c\",\"operation\":\"CREATE\",\"userinfo\":{\"username\":\"admin\",\"uid\":\"admin\",\"groups\":[\"system:masters\",\"system:authenticated\"]}} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:182\",\"msg\":\"admission response created\",\"response\":\"[{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env\\\",\\\"value\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"adn_kops\\\"}]},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"spec.nodeName\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.namespace\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.name\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}}]\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:257\",\"msg\":\"writing response\"} Copy If there are no new entries on the logs, it means that the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook service, this could be due to networking rules or security groups rejecting the communication. To check if the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook you should inspect the apiserver logs for errors like: failed calling webhook \"metadata-injection.newrelic.com\": ERROR_REASON Copy To get the apiserver logs: Start a proxy to the Kubernetes API server by the executing the following command in a terminal window and keep it running. kubectl proxy --port=8001 Copy Create a new pod in your cluster, this will make the apiserver try to communicate with the webhook. The following command will create a busybox. kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Retrieve the apiserver logs. curl localhost:8001/logs/kube-apiserver.log > apiserver.log Copy Delete the busybox container. kubectl delete -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Inspect the logs for errors. grep -E 'failed calling webhook' apiserver.log Copy Remember that one of the requirements for the metadata injection is that the apiserver must be allowed egress to the pods running on the cluster. If you encounter errors regarding connection timeouts or failed connections, make sure to check the security groups and firewall rules of the cluster. If there are no log entries in either the apiserver logs or the metadata injection deployment, it means that the webhook was not properly registered. Ensure the metadata injection setup job ran successfully by inspecting the output of: kubectl get job newrelic-metadata-setup Copy If the job is not completed, investigate the logs of the setup job: kubectl logs job/newrelic-metadata-setup Copy Ensure the CertificateSigningRequest is approved and issued by running: kubectl get csr newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default Copy Ensure the TLS secret is present by running: kubectl get secret newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Ensure the CA bundle is present in the mutating webhook configuration: kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg -o json Copy Ensure the TargetPort of the Service resource matches the Port of the Deployment's container: kubectl describe service/newrelic-metadata-injection-svc kubectl describe deployment/newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment Copy",

      "body": "With New Relic's Kubernetes integration you can monitor both Kubernetes and the services running on it, such as Cassandra, Redis, MySQL, and other supported services. Get started Our Kubernetes integration comes bundled with some of our on-host integrations (like Cassandra, MySQL, and Apache). This lets you get data for those supported services by adding a section to the Kubernetes integration's configuration, which lives as a ConfigMap inside a manifest. What you need Enable this feature for a service Details about how configuration works For an example of how to monitor Redis running on a Kubernetes PHP Guestbook, see this tutorial. What you need To monitor services running on Kubernetes, you only need a Kubernetes cluster running the Kubernetes integration, version 1.13.0 or higher (install | check version | update). We support the following services running on Kubernetes: Apache (does not report inventory data) Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ (does not report inventory data) Redis SNMP Enable monitoring of services To enable our Kubernetes integration to monitor one or more services: Expand this dropdown and get the YAML snippets for the service(s) you want to monitor: Get the config YAML for the integration For the services you want to monitor, follow the links to GitHub to get the YAML snippets you'll need for the next step: Apache Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ Redis SNMP Add the snippet to the Kubernetes integration's ConfigMap, after the data: section: Example configuration This example shows the YAML config for the Apache integration ( highlighted ) added to the Kubernetes integration's config. Respect the indentation levels. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: apache-config.yaml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=apache\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Use the optional arguments: # --namespaces: Comma separated namespaces to discover pods on # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet.

See an example. Depending on your environment, you may need or want to set additional config options. Expand the dropdown below for links to configuration options. Configuration options for each integration Select a service to see available config options: Apache Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ Redis SNMP Verify monitoring is enabled: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure, select Third party services, and then select the service's dashboard. You should see data being reported. Additional notes about enabling services: Enabling multiple services may use more resources than what is set in the resource limits of the Kubernetes integration config file. If this becomes an issue, raise the limit in the resources section. The Kubernetes integration does not automatically update. For best results, regularly update. Monitor services in our Kubernetes integration installed with Helm If you installed our Kubernetes integration using Helm, to monitor services you need to update the existing installation with the new configuration, which contains the services to monitor: helm upgrade --reuse-values -f values.yaml [RELEASE] [CHART] Copy If you use nri-bundle charts, you need to update the children's chart values. Find some examples here. Learn more More resources for learning about configuration: Learn technical details about how configuration works. Learn how to configure monitoring of multiple services with the same config file. See a step-by-step tutorial showing how to monitor a Redis service on Kubernetes. Manually configure service monitoring The enable procedure should be all you need to get monitoring working, but if you run into problems, understanding some technical details about configuration can be helpful. This section goes into more detail about how configuration works. For each service you wish to monitor, you must add a configuration file for that integration to our Kubernetes integration's configuration. This document will cover these subjects: How the service-specific configuration YAML snippet works Adding the service-specific YAML in the Kubernetes integration's config file Adding multiple services to the Kubernetes integration's config file How the service-specific YAML config works Our Kubernetes integration's configuration follows the ConfigMap format. Using a ConfigMap allows us to decouple the configuration for the integrations from the Kubernetes image. The other benefit is that a ConfigMap can be updated automatically without reloading the running container. Because the infrastructure agent uses YAML to configure its associated integrations, ConfigMaps are a good choice for storing YAML. (For more information on config file format, see the Integration config file format.) The Kubernetes integration image comes with an auto-discovery feature that simplifies the configuration of multiple instances of services using a single configuration file. For example, if you have several NGINX instances running, creating an NGINX integration configuration file for every instance would be hard to implement and hard to update. With our auto-discovery option, you can discover and monitor all your NGINX instances with a single configuration file. Each integration has its own specific configuration YAML. Our NGINX integration default config file looks like this: nginx-config.yml: | --- discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet. Default is 10255 # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # Custom Example: # exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes --namespaces namespace1,namespace2 --port 10250 --tls # Default exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes match: label.app: nginx integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}/status STATUS_MODULE: discover METRICS: 1 Copy The above config enables the following: Runs nri-discovery-kubernetes to query the data for the node we are currently on. Parses the data that comes back and looks for any Kubernetes pod that has a Kubernetes container with an app= label with value nginx. For any matches, it attempts to run the NGINX integration. The status URL is built from: The pod's IP address The status page is pulled from the label on K8s pod called status_url This automatic discovery works the same as the container auto-discovery used by the infrastructure agent. For more advanced options, see Container auto-discovery. Add a service YAML to the Kubernetes integration config It's best practice to configure enabled integrations alongside the Kubernetes integration configuration. This is easier than maintaining configuration files for every single service/integration instance. Below is an example of a Kubernetes integration's ConfigMap. The highlighted section shows where an integration configuration YAML (in this case, NGINX) is placed. For more information on discovery:, see Container auto-discovery for on-host integrations. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet.

Make sure the namespace used is the same one used by the Kubernetes integration manifest. If you haven't changed it in the downloaded manifest file, the value is default. Add multiple services to the same config You can monitor several services using the same Kubernetes integration config file. To do this, add another integration configuration YAML to the same Kubernetes integration config file. Below is the Kubernetes config created in the last section, with a new section for the Cassandra integration's config (highlighted). --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Run discovery for Kubernetes.

Additionally, depending on your environment, there may be some additional service-specific configuration you must do.
