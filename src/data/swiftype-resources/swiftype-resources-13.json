This document explains how to configure logs in context and start getting log data. The code and an example application are available on GitHub. Compatibility and requirements To use New Relic logs in context with Log4j 1.x, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements: Java agent 5.6.0 or higher: Install or update JVM argument -javaagent enabled on the Java agent. Log4j 1.x package installed and working on the application. log4j must be configured in code or via XML. Properties files are not supported because AsyncAppender instances can only be automatically configured via XML. Configure logs in context with log management To configure logs in context with Logs4j 1.x: Enable log management with a compatible log forwarding plugin. Install or update the Java agent. Configure the Log4j 1.x extension. Check for logging data. Enable log management Confirm that you have log management enabled, with a compatible log forwarding plugin installed to send your application logs to New Relic. Install or update the Java agent Install or update to the most recent Java agent version, and enable Distributed tracing. Configure the Log4j 1.x extension To configure logs in context with the Log4j 1.x extension, complete the following steps: Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 1.x extension as applicable: To update with Gradle, add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j1:2.0\") } Copy To update with Maven, add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j1</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <appender> element with a NewRelicLayout, adding <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/> as shown below: <appender name=\" TypicalFile \" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <layout class=\" com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout \"/> <!-- only this line needs to be added --> </appender> Copy Once updated, use NewRelicAsyncAppender to wrap any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder. For example: <appender name=\" NewRelicFile \" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\" TypicalFile \" /> </appender> Copy Once updated, use the async appender on the root logger. For example: <root> <appender-ref ref=\" NewRelicFile \" /> </root> Copy Example configuration file for the Log4j 1.x extension <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?> <!DOCTYPE log4j:configuration SYSTEM \"log4j.dtd\"> <log4j:configuration debug=\"false\"> <appender name=\"TypicalFile\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <!-- layout has been replaced --> <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender was added --> <appender name=\"NewRelicFile\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalFile\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"TypicalConsole\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\"> <layout class=\"org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\"> <param name=\"ConversionPattern\" value=\"%-5p %c{1} - %m%n\"/> </layout> </appender> <root> ​ <!-- the new appender was used here -->​​ <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicFile\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalConsole\" /> </root> </log4j:configuration> Copy Check for logging data To verify that you have configured the extension correctly, run your application and verify that the logging you have configured contains the following: Includes trace.id and span.id fields Is properly-formatted JSON lines If everything is configured correctly and your data is being reported, you should see data logs in the New Relic Logs UI using the query operator has: span.id/trace.id.

This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by checking what you need. Install the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Configure your log sources and other parameters in the logging.d directory. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. What you need The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x and 18.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Test log forwarding To quickly check that the log forwarding feature works, follow these steps. If you're running the infrastructure monitoring agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the user executing nri-agent has read permissions for the data sources. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file (for example, logs.yml) with this content: Linux example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: /var/log/test.log Copy Windows example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: 'C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log' Copy Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy For example: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /var/log/test.log Copy Search New Relic Logs for test message. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. You can add as many config files as you want, and set as many sources as you need per config file. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file with the parameters you need. Use our sample config file as reference. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart it. Log forwarding parameters The log forwarder config supports the following parameters (for examples, see the sample configuration). name Name of the log or logs. attributes List of custom attributes, as key-value pairs, that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. For example, you can enable built-in parsing rules by setting the logtype attribute. Example: ... - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 format: none separator: \\t attributes: # You can add custom attributes to any source of logs tcpFormat: none logtype: nginx # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing someOtherAttribute: associatedValue Copy file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Your file can point to a specific log file or multiple ones by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log Example: logs: - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Wildcards can also be used in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files pattern: redis # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy Once you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd (Linux only) Service name. Once the systemd input is activated, log messages are collected from the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog (Linux only) Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the Infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

Some of them are inserted for any log record, while other depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the Log Forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the Entity GUID of infrastructure as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. Troubleshoot log forwarding If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the Infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\":  first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic The infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent so that the new settings can be loaded. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get this error: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher. Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next?

      "body": "You can forward your logs to New Relic using our infrastructure monitoring agent. This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by checking what you need. Install the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Configure your log sources and other parameters in the logging.d directory. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. What you need The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x and 18.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Test log forwarding To quickly check that the log forwarding feature works, follow these steps. If you're running the infrastructure monitoring agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the user executing nri-agent has read permissions for the data sources. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file (for example, logs.yml) with this content: Linux example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: /var/log/test.log Copy Windows example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: 'C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log' Copy Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy For example: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /var/log/test.log Copy Search New Relic Logs for test message. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. You can add as many config files as you want, and set as many sources as you need per config file. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file with the parameters you need. Use our sample config file as reference. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart it. Log forwarding parameters The log forwarder config supports the following parameters (for examples, see the sample configuration). name Name of the log or logs. attributes List of custom attributes, as key-value pairs, that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. For example, you can enable built-in parsing rules by setting the logtype attribute. Example: ... - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 format: none separator: \\t attributes: # You can add custom attributes to any source of logs tcpFormat: none logtype: nginx # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing someOtherAttribute: associatedValue Copy file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Your file can point to a specific log file or multiple ones by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log Example: logs: - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Wildcards can also be used in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files pattern: redis # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy Once you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd (Linux only) Service name. Once the systemd input is activated, log messages are collected from the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog (Linux only) Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the Infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

Some of them are inserted for any log record, while other depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the Log Forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the Entity GUID of infrastructure as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. Troubleshoot log forwarding If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the Infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\":  first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic The infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent so that the new settings can be loaded. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get this error: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher. Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Configure your agent to see contextual log data, such as distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts.",

Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by checking what you need. Install the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Configure your log sources and other parameters in the logging.d directory. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. What you need The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x and 18.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Test log forwarding To quickly check that the log forwarding feature works, follow these steps. If you're running the infrastructure monitoring agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the user executing nri-agent has read permissions for the data sources. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file (for example, logs.yml) with this content: Linux example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: /var/log/test.log Copy Windows example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: 'C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log' Copy Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy For example: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /var/log/test.log Copy Search New Relic Logs for test message. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. You can add as many config files as you want, and set as many sources as you need per config file. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file with the parameters you need. Use our sample config file as reference. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart it. Log forwarding parameters The log forwarder config supports the following parameters (for examples, see the sample configuration). name Name of the log or logs. attributes List of custom attributes, as key-value pairs, that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. For example, you can enable built-in parsing rules by setting the logtype attribute. Example: ... - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 format: none separator: \\t attributes: # You can add custom attributes to any source of logs tcpFormat: none logtype: nginx # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing someOtherAttribute: associatedValue Copy file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Your file can point to a specific log file or multiple ones by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log Example: logs: - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Wildcards can also be used in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files pattern: redis # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy Once you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd (Linux only) Service name. Once the systemd input is activated, log messages are collected from the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog (Linux only) Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the Infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format.

Some of them are inserted for any log record, while other depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the Log Forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the Entity GUID of infrastructure as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. Troubleshoot log forwarding If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the Infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\":  first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic The infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent so that the new settings can be loaded. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get this error: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher. Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Configure your agent to see contextual log data, such as distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts.",

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by checking what you need. Install the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Configure your log sources and other parameters in the logging.d directory. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. What you need The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x and 18.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Test log forwarding To quickly check that the log forwarding feature works, follow these steps. If you're running the infrastructure monitoring agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the user executing nri-agent has read permissions for the data sources. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file (for example, logs.yml) with this content: Linux example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: /var/log/test.log Copy Windows example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: 'C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log' Copy Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy For example: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /var/log/test.log Copy Search New Relic Logs for test message. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. You can add as many config files as you want, and set as many sources as you need per config file. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file with the parameters you need. Use our sample config file as reference. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart it. Log forwarding parameters The log forwarder config supports the following parameters (for examples, see the sample configuration). name Name of the log or logs. attributes List of custom attributes, as key-value pairs, that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. For example, you can enable built-in parsing rules by setting the logtype attribute. Example: ... - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 format: none separator: \\t attributes: # You can add custom attributes to any source of logs tcpFormat: none logtype: nginx # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing someOtherAttribute: associatedValue Copy file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Your file can point to a specific log file or multiple ones by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log Example: logs: - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Wildcards can also be used in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files pattern: redis # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy Once you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd (Linux only) Service name. Once the systemd input is activated, log messages are collected from the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog (Linux only) Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the Infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

Some of them are inserted for any log record, while other depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the Log Forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the Entity GUID of infrastructure as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. Troubleshoot log forwarding If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the Infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\":  first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic The infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent so that the new settings can be loaded. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get this error: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher. Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Configure your agent to see contextual log data, such as distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts.",

This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by checking what you need. Install the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Configure your log sources and other parameters in the logging.d directory. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. What you need The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x and 18.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Test log forwarding To quickly check that the log forwarding feature works, follow these steps. If you're running the infrastructure monitoring agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the user executing nri-agent has read permissions for the data sources. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file (for example, logs.yml) with this content: Linux example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: /var/log/test.log Copy Windows example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: 'C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log' Copy Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy For example: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /var/log/test.log Copy Search New Relic Logs for test message. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. You can add as many config files as you want, and set as many sources as you need per config file. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file with the parameters you need. Use our sample config file as reference. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart it. Log forwarding parameters The log forwarder config supports the following parameters (for examples, see the sample configuration). name Name of the log or logs. attributes List of custom attributes, as key-value pairs, that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. For example, you can enable built-in parsing rules by setting the logtype attribute. Example: ... - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 format: none separator: \\t attributes: # You can add custom attributes to any source of logs tcpFormat: none logtype: nginx # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing someOtherAttribute: associatedValue Copy file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Your file can point to a specific log file or multiple ones by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log Example: logs: - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Wildcards can also be used in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files pattern: redis # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy Once you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd (Linux only) Service name. Once the systemd input is activated, log messages are collected from the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog (Linux only) Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the Infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

Some of them are inserted for any log record, while other depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the Log Forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the Entity GUID of infrastructure as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. Troubleshoot log forwarding If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the Infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\":  first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic The infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent so that the new settings can be loaded. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get this error: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher. Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next?

This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by checking what you need. Install the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Configure your log sources and other parameters in the logging.d directory. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. What you need The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x and 18.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Test log forwarding To quickly check that the log forwarding feature works, follow these steps. If you're running the infrastructure monitoring agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the user executing nri-agent has read permissions for the data sources. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file (for example, logs.yml) with this content: Linux example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: /var/log/test.log Copy Windows example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: 'C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log' Copy Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy For example: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /var/log/test.log Copy Search New Relic Logs for test message. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. You can add as many config files as you want, and set as many sources as you need per config file. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file with the parameters you need. Use our sample config file as reference. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart it. Log forwarding parameters The log forwarder config supports the following parameters (for examples, see the sample configuration). name Name of the log or logs. attributes List of custom attributes, as key-value pairs, that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. For example, you can enable built-in parsing rules by setting the logtype attribute. Example: ... - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 format: none separator: \\t attributes: # You can add custom attributes to any source of logs tcpFormat: none logtype: nginx # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing someOtherAttribute: associatedValue Copy file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Your file can point to a specific log file or multiple ones by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log Example: logs: - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Wildcards can also be used in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files pattern: redis # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy Once you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd (Linux only) Service name. Once the systemd input is activated, log messages are collected from the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog (Linux only) Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the Infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

Some of them are inserted for any log record, while other depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the Log Forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the Entity GUID of infrastructure as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. Troubleshoot log forwarding If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the Infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\":  first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic The infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent so that the new settings can be loaded. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get this error: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher. Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next?

Read on to learn how to enable this feature and start using it. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements To use log management, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements: Your New Relic account's license key A compatible log forwarding plugin installed Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name log-api.newrelic.com or log-api.eu.newrelic.com. Enable log management in New Relic There are several ways of bringing your logs into New Relic: Use the New Relic infrastructure agent Use log forwarding plugins (like Fluentd) Use the New Relic Logs API Enable log management using the infrastructure agent You can forward your logs to New Relic using the infrastructure agent, our lightweight data collector, without having to use additional software. For more information, see Forward your logs using the infrastructure agent. Enable log management in New Relic using a log forwarding solution You can use any of these solutions to forward your logs to New Relic: Infrastructure agent Kubernetes plugin AWS Lambda for sending logs from S3 AWS CloudWatch plugin AWS Kinesis Firehose AWS FireLens plugin Fluent Bit plugin Fluentd plugin Logstash plugin Vector plugin Heroku Log Streaming Syslog TCP Endpoint Enable using the Logs API If you prefer to connect to New Relic without installing a plugin, New Relic offers HTTP input integration. This will allow you to send your monitored log data directly to New Relic via the Log API. For more information, see Introduction to Log API. What's next?

      "body": "You can forward your logs to New Relic using our infrastructure monitoring agent. This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by checking what you need. Install the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Configure your log sources and other parameters in the logging.d directory. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. What you need The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x and 18.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Test log forwarding To quickly check that the log forwarding feature works, follow these steps. If you're running the infrastructure monitoring agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the user executing nri-agent has read permissions for the data sources. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file (for example, logs.yml) with this content: Linux example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: /var/log/test.log Copy Windows example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: 'C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log' Copy Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy For example: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /var/log/test.log Copy Search New Relic Logs for test message. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. You can add as many config files as you want, and set as many sources as you need per config file. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file with the parameters you need. Use our sample config file as reference. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart it. Log forwarding parameters The log forwarder config supports the following parameters (for examples, see the sample configuration). name Name of the log or logs. attributes List of custom attributes, as key-value pairs, that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. For example, you can enable built-in parsing rules by setting the logtype attribute. Example: ... - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 format: none separator: \\t attributes: # You can add custom attributes to any source of logs tcpFormat: none logtype: nginx # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing someOtherAttribute: associatedValue Copy file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Your file can point to a specific log file or multiple ones by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log Example: logs: - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Wildcards can also be used in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files pattern: redis # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy Once you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd (Linux only) Service name. Once the systemd input is activated, log messages are collected from the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog (Linux only) Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the Infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

Some of them are inserted for any log record, while other depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the Log Forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the Entity GUID of infrastructure as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. Troubleshoot log forwarding If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the Infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\":  first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic The infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent so that the new settings can be loaded. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get this error: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher. Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next?

This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by checking what you need. Install the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Configure your log sources and other parameters in the logging.d directory. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. What you need The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x and 18.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Test log forwarding To quickly check that the log forwarding feature works, follow these steps. If you're running the infrastructure monitoring agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the user executing nri-agent has read permissions for the data sources. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file (for example, logs.yml) with this content: Linux example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: /var/log/test.log Copy Windows example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: 'C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log' Copy Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy For example: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /var/log/test.log Copy Search New Relic Logs for test message. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. You can add as many config files as you want, and set as many sources as you need per config file. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file with the parameters you need. Use our sample config file as reference. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart it. Log forwarding parameters The log forwarder config supports the following parameters (for examples, see the sample configuration). name Name of the log or logs. attributes List of custom attributes, as key-value pairs, that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. For example, you can enable built-in parsing rules by setting the logtype attribute. Example: ... - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 format: none separator: \\t attributes: # You can add custom attributes to any source of logs tcpFormat: none logtype: nginx # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing someOtherAttribute: associatedValue Copy file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Your file can point to a specific log file or multiple ones by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log Example: logs: - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Wildcards can also be used in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files pattern: redis # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy Once you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd (Linux only) Service name. Once the systemd input is activated, log messages are collected from the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog (Linux only) Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the Infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

Some of them are inserted for any log record, while other depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the Log Forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the Entity GUID of infrastructure as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. Troubleshoot log forwarding If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the Infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\":  first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic The infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent so that the new settings can be loaded. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get this error: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher. Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next?

      "body": "You can forward your logs to New Relic using our infrastructure monitoring agent. This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by checking what you need. Install the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Configure your log sources and other parameters in the logging.d directory. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. What you need The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x and 18.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Test log forwarding To quickly check that the log forwarding feature works, follow these steps. If you're running the infrastructure monitoring agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the user executing nri-agent has read permissions for the data sources. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file (for example, logs.yml) with this content: Linux example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: /var/log/test.log Copy Windows example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: 'C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log' Copy Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy For example: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /var/log/test.log Copy Search New Relic Logs for test message. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. You can add as many config files as you want, and set as many sources as you need per config file. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file with the parameters you need. Use our sample config file as reference. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart it. Log forwarding parameters The log forwarder config supports the following parameters (for examples, see the sample configuration). name Name of the log or logs. attributes List of custom attributes, as key-value pairs, that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. For example, you can enable built-in parsing rules by setting the logtype attribute. Example: ... - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 format: none separator: \\t attributes: # You can add custom attributes to any source of logs tcpFormat: none logtype: nginx # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing someOtherAttribute: associatedValue Copy file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Your file can point to a specific log file or multiple ones by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log Example: logs: - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Wildcards can also be used in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files pattern: redis # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy Once you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd (Linux only) Service name. Once the systemd input is activated, log messages are collected from the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog (Linux only) Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the Infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

Some of them are inserted for any log record, while other depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the Log Forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the Entity GUID of infrastructure as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. Troubleshoot log forwarding If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the Infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\":  first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic The infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent so that the new settings can be loaded. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get this error: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher. Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Configure your agent to see contextual log data, such as distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts.",

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by checking what you need. Install the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Configure your log sources and other parameters in the logging.d directory. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. What you need The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x and 18.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Test log forwarding To quickly check that the log forwarding feature works, follow these steps. If you're running the infrastructure monitoring agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the user executing nri-agent has read permissions for the data sources. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file (for example, logs.yml) with this content: Linux example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: /var/log/test.log Copy Windows example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: 'C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log' Copy Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy For example: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /var/log/test.log Copy Search New Relic Logs for test message. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. You can add as many config files as you want, and set as many sources as you need per config file. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file with the parameters you need. Use our sample config file as reference. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart it. Log forwarding parameters The log forwarder config supports the following parameters (for examples, see the sample configuration). name Name of the log or logs. attributes List of custom attributes, as key-value pairs, that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. For example, you can enable built-in parsing rules by setting the logtype attribute. Example: ... - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 format: none separator: \\t attributes: # You can add custom attributes to any source of logs tcpFormat: none logtype: nginx # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing someOtherAttribute: associatedValue Copy file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Your file can point to a specific log file or multiple ones by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log Example: logs: - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Wildcards can also be used in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files pattern: redis # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy Once you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd (Linux only) Service name. Once the systemd input is activated, log messages are collected from the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog (Linux only) Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the Infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file.

The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format.

Some of them are inserted for any log record, while other depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the Log Forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the Entity GUID of infrastructure as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. Troubleshoot log forwarding If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the Infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\":  first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic The infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent so that the new settings can be loaded. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get this error: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher. Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI.

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by checking what you need. Install the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Configure your log sources and other parameters in the logging.d directory. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. What you need The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x and 18.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Test log forwarding To quickly check that the log forwarding feature works, follow these steps. If you're running the infrastructure monitoring agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the user executing nri-agent has read permissions for the data sources. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file (for example, logs.yml) with this content: Linux example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: /var/log/test.log Copy Windows example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: 'C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log' Copy Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy For example: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /var/log/test.log Copy Search New Relic Logs for test message. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. You can add as many config files as you want, and set as many sources as you need per config file. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file with the parameters you need. Use our sample config file as reference. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart it. Log forwarding parameters The log forwarder config supports the following parameters (for examples, see the sample configuration). name Name of the log or logs. attributes List of custom attributes, as key-value pairs, that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. For example, you can enable built-in parsing rules by setting the logtype attribute. Example: ... - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 format: none separator: \\t attributes: # You can add custom attributes to any source of logs tcpFormat: none logtype: nginx # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing someOtherAttribute: associatedValue Copy file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Your file can point to a specific log file or multiple ones by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log Example: logs: - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Wildcards can also be used in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files pattern: redis # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy Once you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd (Linux only) Service name. Once the systemd input is activated, log messages are collected from the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog (Linux only) Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the Infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file.

Some of them are inserted for any log record, while other depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the Log Forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the Entity GUID of infrastructure as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. Troubleshoot log forwarding If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the Infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\":  first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic The infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent so that the new settings can be loaded. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get this error: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher. Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Configure your agent to see contextual log data, such as distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts.",

This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by checking what you need. Install the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Configure your log sources and other parameters in the logging.d directory. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. What you need The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x and 18.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Test log forwarding To quickly check that the log forwarding feature works, follow these steps. If you're running the infrastructure monitoring agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the user executing nri-agent has read permissions for the data sources. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file (for example, logs.yml) with this content: Linux example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: /var/log/test.log Copy Windows example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: 'C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log' Copy Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy For example: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /var/log/test.log Copy Search New Relic Logs for test message. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. You can add as many config files as you want, and set as many sources as you need per config file. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file with the parameters you need. Use our sample config file as reference. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart it. Log forwarding parameters The log forwarder config supports the following parameters (for examples, see the sample configuration). name Name of the log or logs. attributes List of custom attributes, as key-value pairs, that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. For example, you can enable built-in parsing rules by setting the logtype attribute. Example: ... - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 format: none separator: \\t attributes: # You can add custom attributes to any source of logs tcpFormat: none logtype: nginx # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing someOtherAttribute: associatedValue Copy file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Your file can point to a specific log file or multiple ones by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log Example: logs: - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Wildcards can also be used in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files pattern: redis # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy Once you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd (Linux only) Service name. Once the systemd input is activated, log messages are collected from the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog (Linux only) Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the Infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

Some of them are inserted for any log record, while other depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the Log Forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the Entity GUID of infrastructure as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. Troubleshoot log forwarding If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the Infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\":  first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic The infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent so that the new settings can be loaded. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get this error: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher. Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI.

This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by checking what you need. Install the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Configure your log sources and other parameters in the logging.d directory. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. What you need The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x and 18.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Test log forwarding To quickly check that the log forwarding feature works, follow these steps. If you're running the infrastructure monitoring agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the user executing nri-agent has read permissions for the data sources. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file (for example, logs.yml) with this content: Linux example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: /var/log/test.log Copy Windows example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: 'C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log' Copy Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy For example: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /var/log/test.log Copy Search New Relic Logs for test message. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. You can add as many config files as you want, and set as many sources as you need per config file. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file with the parameters you need. Use our sample config file as reference. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart it. Log forwarding parameters The log forwarder config supports the following parameters (for examples, see the sample configuration). name Name of the log or logs. attributes List of custom attributes, as key-value pairs, that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. For example, you can enable built-in parsing rules by setting the logtype attribute. Example: ... - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 format: none separator: \\t attributes: # You can add custom attributes to any source of logs tcpFormat: none logtype: nginx # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing someOtherAttribute: associatedValue Copy file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Your file can point to a specific log file or multiple ones by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log Example: logs: - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Wildcards can also be used in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files pattern: redis # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy Once you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd (Linux only) Service name. Once the systemd input is activated, log messages are collected from the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog (Linux only) Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the Infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

Some of them are inserted for any log record, while other depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the Log Forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the Entity GUID of infrastructure as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. Troubleshoot log forwarding If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the Infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\":  first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic The infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent so that the new settings can be loaded. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get this error: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher. Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next?

Compatibility and requirements To forward your logs to New Relic using Logstash, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements: New Relic license key (recommended) or Insert API key Logstash 6.6 or higher Logstash requires Java 8 or Java 11. Use the official Oracle distribution or an open-source distribution such as OpenJDK. Enable Logstash for log management To enable log management using Logstash: Install the Logstash plugin. Configure the Logstash plugin. Optional: Configure additional plugin attributes. Test the Logstash plugin. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Install the Logstash plugin To install the Logstash plugin, enter the following command into your terminal or command line interface: logstash-plugin install logstash-output-newrelic Copy Configure the Logstash plugin To configure your Logstash plugin: In your logstash.conf file, add the following block of data. Be sure to replace the placeholder text with your New Relic license key or Insights Insert key. Configure with the New Relic license key (recommended): output { newrelic { license_key => \"LICENSE_KEY\" } } Copy Or, configure with the New Relic Insert API key: output { newrelic { api_key => \"INSERT_API_KEY\" } } Copy Restart your Logstash instance. Optional configuration Once you have installed and configured the Logstash plugin, you can use the following attributes to configure how the plugin sends data to New Relic: Property Description Default value concurrent_requests The number of threads to make requests from. 1 base_uri The New Relic ingestion endpoint. US endpoint: https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 EU endpoint: https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1 max_retries Maximum number attempts to retry to send a message. If set to 0, no re-attempts will be made. 3 For more information on adding or configuring attributes, see Example Configurations for Logstash. Test the Logstash plugin To test if your Logstash plugin is receiving input from a log file: Add the following to your logstash.conf file: input { file { path => \"/PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE\" } } Copy Restart your Logstash instance. Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"test message\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy Search New Relic Logs UI for test message. View log data If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see data logs in both of these places: New Relic Logs UI New Relic tools for running NRQL queries. For example, you can execute a query like this: SELECT * FROM Log Copy What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Configure your agent to see contextual log data, such as distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts.

If you are logging to the console (stdout/stderr), look for ConsoleAppender and replace : <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy If you are logging to a file, look for FileAppender and replace <encoder>: <appender name=\"LOG_FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>logs/app-log-file.log</file> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy Update your logging configuration xml with the NewRelicAsyncAppender. To ensure that NewRelicAsyncAppender wraps any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder, add the following section. Change \"LOG_FILE\" to the name of the appender you updated in the previous step. <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"LOG_FILE\" /> </appender> Copy Make sure NewRelicAsyncAppender is the appender used in your logger. Replace your root logger’s appenders with the ASYNC appender created in the previous step. <root> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> Copy Important It's important that the NewRelicAsyncAppender be the first appender to see the log message. List any other appenders after the NewRelicAsyncAppender in the <root> list. Example configuration files You can find a working example in GitHub. Here are examples of an updated logging .xml file for the Logback extension.

Configure the Log4j 2.x extension To configure logs in context with the Log4j 2.x extension, complete the following steps: Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 2.x extension as applicable: To update with Gradle, add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j2:2.0\") } Copy To update with Maven, add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j2</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <configuration> element by adding the highlighted section: <Configuration xmlns=\"http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.0/config\" packages=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j2\" > Copy If you are using a properties file, add packages=com.newrelic.logging.log4j2. Once updated, add <NewRelicLayout/> to use a NewRelicLayout element within one of the appenders. For example: <File name=\"MyFile\" fileName=\"logs/app-log-file.log\"> <NewRelicLayout/> </File> Copy If you are using a properties file, change only the layout.type property, as shown below: appender.console.type = Console appender.console.name = STDOUT appender.console.layout.type = NewRelicLayout Copy If you only modified an existing appender, you can skip this step. Add <AppenderRef/> within <Root> to use this appender. The ref attribute refers to the name of the appender you created in the previous step. For example: <Root level=\"info\"> <AppenderRef ref=\"MyFile\"/> </Root> Copy If you are using a properties file, you will need to add a property if you added a new appender: rootLogger.level = info rootLogger.appenderRef.stdout.ref = STDOUT ​​​​​ Copy Check for logging data To verify that you have configured the extension correctly, run your application and verify that the logging you have configured contains the following: Includes trace.id and span.id fields Is properly-formatted JSON lines If everything is configured correctly and your data is being reported, you should see data logs in the New Relic Logs UI using the query operator has: span.id/trace.id.

Configure the java.util.logging extension To configure logs in context with the java.util.logging extension, complete the following steps: Update your project's dependencies to include the java.util.logging extension as applicable: To update with Gradle, add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:jul:2.0\") } Copy To update with Maven, add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>jul</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Tip Can't edit these files? You can add the jars directly to the application classpath. Use the NewRelicMemoryHandler to intercept messages destined for another handler. Your file will have a handlers property, but it might be set to something else. Your logging properties file will include a line listing the root logger's handlers, like this: handlers = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Update your logging properties file set the root logger's handler. handlers = com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler Copy Configure the NewRelicMemoryHandler by setting the target to the handler that was previously set for the handlers property. The value of this property should be the handler that was previously assigned to the root logger. com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler.target = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Tip Why? The New Relic log format includes data from the New Relic agent that must be captured on the thread the log message is coming from. This MemoryHandler implementation intercepts that data. Use a NewRelicFormatter for the final handler. Update your logging properties file to set the formatter property like the example below. Note: the handler on which you set the formatter must be the target handler from the previous step (java.util.logging.FileHandler in this example). java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter = com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicFormatter Copy Tip Why? The New Relic log format is a tailored JSON format with specific fields in specific places that our log forwarder plugins and back end rely on. At this time, we don't support any customization of that format. Tip Once complete, JSON is logged instead of text. The JSON should be formatted as single objects, one per line, and should contain fields likelog.level and thread.name. The trace.id, which is required for Logs in Context,should only have a value for log messages that occur within a transaction. Check for logging data To verify that you have configured the extension correctly, run your application and verify that the logging you have configured contains the following: Includes trace.id and span.id fields Is properly-formatted JSON lines If everything is configured correctly and your data is being reported, you should see data logs in the New Relic Logs UI using the query operator has: span.id/trace.id. What's next? Now that you've set up APM logs in context, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts.",

If you are logging to the console (stdout/stderr), look for ConsoleAppender and replace : <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy If you are logging to a file, look for FileAppender and replace <encoder>: <appender name=\"LOG_FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>logs/app-log-file.log</file> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy Update your logging configuration xml with the NewRelicAsyncAppender. To ensure that NewRelicAsyncAppender wraps any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder, add the following section. Change \"LOG_FILE\" to the name of the appender you updated in the previous step. <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"LOG_FILE\" /> </appender> Copy Make sure NewRelicAsyncAppender is the appender used in your logger.

You can add the jars directly to the application classpath. Use the NewRelicMemoryHandler to intercept messages destined for another handler. Your file will have a handlers property, but it might be set to something else. Your logging properties file will include a line listing the root logger's handlers, like this: handlers = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Update your logging properties file set the root logger's handler. handlers = com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler Copy Configure the NewRelicMemoryHandler by setting the target to the handler that was previously set for the handlers property. The value of this property should be the handler that was previously assigned to the root logger. com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler.target = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Tip Why? The New Relic log format includes data from the New Relic agent that must be captured on the thread the log message is coming from. This MemoryHandler implementation intercepts that data. Use a NewRelicFormatter for the final handler. Update your logging properties file to set the formatter property like the example below. Note: the handler on which you set the formatter must be the target handler from the previous step (java.util.logging.FileHandler in this example). java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter = com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicFormatter Copy Tip Why? The New Relic log format is a tailored JSON format with specific fields in specific places that our log forwarder plugins and back end rely on. At this time, we don't support any customization of that format. Tip Once complete, JSON is logged instead of text. The JSON should be formatted as single objects, one per line, and should contain fields likelog.level and thread.name. The trace.id, which is required for Logs in Context,should only have a value for log messages that occur within a transaction. Check for logging data To verify that you have configured the extension correctly, run your application and verify that the logging you have configured contains the following: Includes trace.id and span.id fields Is properly-formatted JSON lines If everything is configured correctly and your data is being reported, you should see data logs in the New Relic Logs UI using the query operator has: span.id/trace.id.

Add <AppenderRef/> within <Root> to use this appender. The ref attribute refers to the name of the appender you created in the previous step. For example: <Root level=\"info\"> <AppenderRef ref=\"MyFile\"/> </Root> Copy If you are using a properties file, you will need to add a property if you added a new appender: rootLogger.level = info rootLogger.appenderRef.stdout.ref = STDOUT ​​​​​ Copy Check for logging data To verify that you have configured the extension correctly, run your application and verify that the logging you have configured contains the following: Includes trace.id and span.id fields Is properly-formatted JSON lines If everything is configured correctly and your data is being reported, you should see data logs in the New Relic Logs UI using the query operator has: span.id/trace.id.

      "body": "New Relic offers a Logback extension for log management, allowing you link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. This document explains how to configure logs in context and start getting log data. The code and an example application are available on GitHub. Compatibility and requirements To use New Relic logs in context with Logback, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements: Java agent 5.6.0 or higher: Install or update Logback 1.2.0 or higher installed and working on the application. Configure logs in context with log management To configure New Relic logs in context with Logback: Enable log management with a compatible log forwarding plugin. Install or update the Java agent. Configure the Logback extension. Check for logging data. Enable log management Confirm that you have log management enabled, with a compatible log forwarding plugin installed to send your application logs to New Relic. Install or update the Java agent Install or update to the most recent Java agent version, and enable Distributed tracing. Configure the Logback extension To configure logs in context with the Logback extension, complete the following steps: Update your project's dependencies to include the Logback extension as applicable: To update with Gradle, add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:logback:2.0\") } Copy To update with Maven, add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>logback</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your logging configuration xml to replace any existing < encoder> element as shown below. If you are logging to the console (stdout/stderr), look for ConsoleAppender and replace : <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy If you are logging to a file, look for FileAppender and replace <encoder>: <appender name=\"LOG_FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>logs/app-log-file.log</file> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy Update your logging configuration xml with the NewRelicAsyncAppender. To ensure that NewRelicAsyncAppender wraps any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder, add the following section. Change \"LOG_FILE\" to the name of the appender you updated in the previous step. <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"LOG_FILE\" /> </appender> Copy Make sure NewRelicAsyncAppender is the appender used in your logger. Replace your root logger’s appenders with the ASYNC appender created in the previous step. <root> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> Copy Important It's important that the NewRelicAsyncAppender be the first appender to see the log message. List any other appenders after the NewRelicAsyncAppender in the <root> list. Example configuration files You can find a working example in GitHub. Here are examples of an updated logging .xml file for the Logback extension. Single console appender example Example configuration file after adding in the logging extension information. <configuration> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <!-- changed the encoder --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- added the ASYNC appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- changed the root logger --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Two-appender example This example sends New Relic logging to a file, but still sends standard logging to the console. <configuration> <appender name=\"FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>myApp.log</file> <!-- encoder changed --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender does normal console logging --> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder> <pattern>%msg%n</pattern> </encoder> </appender> <!-- The required New Relic ASYNC appender wraps the FILE appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"FILE\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- ASYNC is one of the main appenders --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> <!-- Send every message to normal console logging, as well. --> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Check for logging data To verify that you have configured the extension correctly, run your application and verify that the logging you have configured contains the following: Includes trace.id and span.id fields Is properly-formatted JSON lines If everything is configured correctly and your data is being reported, you should see data logs in the New Relic Logs UI using the query operator has: span.id/trace.id.

This diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Serilog. This diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Serilog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic Serilog extension. The above diagram highlights several components of the Serilog extension: New Relic Enricher: The NewRelicEnricher adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans from which they were created.

Read on to learn how to configure logs in context and enrich your log data.

NewRelicAppender enriches log messages with contextual information from the New Relic .NET agent if it is attached to your application. The appender passes enriched log messages to downstream appenders for specific use case log message handle. Log4net also provides NewRelicLayout to output log messages in the way required by the New Relic logging endpoint. A target can then be configured to write logging data to an output folder, which can be monitored by a log forwarder to incrementally send log information to New Relic. This diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through log4net: This diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through log4net, highlighting specific components of the New Relic log4net extension. The above diagram highlights the main components of the log4net logs in context solution: New Relic Appender: The NewRelicAppender adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans from which they were created. This appender will pass the enriched Log Events to downstream appenders for further processing. Since the NewRelicAppender is ForwardingAppender type, it needs to be the first appender in the chain and requires another appender that can write to an actual output destination as its child in order to work. New Relic Layout: The NewRelicLayout formats the enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. The appender, which this layout is assigned to, instructs log4net to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. New Relic Log Forwarder: The log forwarder monitors an output folder and incrementally sends New Relic formatted Log information to the New Relic Logging Endpoint. There are many log-forwarders available. For our examples, we will use Fluentd. For more information about logging with log4net, see the Apache log4net Getting started documentation. Configure logs in context with New Relic Logs To configure New Relic logs in context with Enable New Relic Logs with a compatible log forwarding plugin. Install or update the .NET agent. Configure the log4net extension. Check for logging data. Enable New Relic Logs Confirm that you have New Relic Logs enabled, with a compatible log forwarding plugin installed to send your application logs to New Relic. Install or update the .NET agent Install or update to the most recent .NET agent version, and enable Distributed tracing. Configure the log4net extension To configure logs in context with the log4net extension, complete the following steps: Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net package. In your log4net configuration file, update your logging configuration to use the NewRelicAppender as the first level appender, and reference your existing appenders as its children. You also need to replace the layout of the appender that writes log messages to an output destination with the NewRelicLayout . The following log4net configuration example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: <log4net> <root> <level value=\"ALL\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicAppender\" /> </root> <appender name=\"NewRelicAppender\" type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicAppender, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\" > <threshold value=\"ALL\"/> <appender-ref ref=\"FileAppender\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"FileAppender\" type=\"log4net.Appender.FileAppender\"> <file value=\"C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json\" /> <param name=\"AppendToFile\" value=\"true\" /> <layout type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicLayout, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\"> </layout> </appender> </log4net> Copy Once you have configured the log4net extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic Logs.

Using Enrichers, you can add additional information to the log events, while Sinks and Formatters allow you to format and output those log events for downstream consumption and viewing. This diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Serilog. This diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Serilog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic Serilog extension. The above diagram highlights several components of the Serilog extension: New Relic Enricher: The NewRelicEnricher adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans from which they were created. New Relic Formatter: The NewRelicFormattertranslates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the Log Forwarder expects. New Relic Log Forwarder: The NewRelicFormattertranslates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. The example below uses the New Relic Fluentd log forwarded, however there are many other log forwarders that can be used. For more information, see Introduction to log management. For more information about Serilog log events, see the Serilog Getting started documentation. Configure logs in context with log management To configure New Relic logs in context with Serilog: Enable log management with a compatible log forwarding plugin. Install or update the .NET agent. Configure the Serilog extension. Check for logging data. Enable log management Confirm that you have log management enabled, with a compatible log forwarding plugin installed to send your application logs to New Relic. Install or update the .NET agent Install or update to the most recent .NET agent version, and enable Distributed tracing. Configure the Serilog extension To configure logs in context with the Serilog extension, complete the following steps: Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicEnricher and NewRelicFormatter. The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json for consumption by the Log Forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggerConfiguration() loggerConfig .Enrich.WithThreadName() .Enrich.WithThreadId() .Enrich.WithNewRelicLogsInContext() .WriteTo.File( path: @\"C:\\logs\\ExistingLoggingOutput.txt\") .WriteTo.File( formatter: new NewRelicFormatter(), path: @\"C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json\"); var log = loggerConfig.CreateLogger(); Copy Caution The above configuration results in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful in managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the sink. restrictedToMinimumLevel buffered rollingInterval rollOnFileSizeLimit retainedFileCountLimit Important Though not required, using the Serilog Asynchronous Sink Wrapper may help improve the performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Once you have configured the Serilog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic Logs. See below for an example of this configuration using the Fluentd plugin for New Relic Logs: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy File-based configuration Configuration of the New Relic Logs Serilog extension may also be accomplished with file-based configuration providers. appsettings.json based configuration The example code below creates a logger based on settings contained in an appSettings.json file.

This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans from which they were created. This appender will pass the enriched Log Events to downstream appenders for further processing.

New Relic Layout: The NewRelicLayout formats the enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. The appender, which this layout is assigned to, instructs log4net to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. New Relic Log Forwarder: The log forwarder monitors an output folder and incrementally sends New Relic formatted Log information to the New Relic Logging Endpoint.

New Relic Log Forwarder: The log forwarder is configured to send the log data from the FileTarget's output to New Relic. The example below uses the New Relic Fluentd log forwarder, however there are many other log forwarders that can be used. For more information, see Introduction to log management. For more information about logging with NLog, see the NLog Getting started documentation. Configure logs in context with log management To configure logs in context with NLog: Enable log management with a compatible log forwarding plugin. Install or update the .NET agent. Configure the NLog extension. Check for logging data. Enable log management Confirm that you have log management enabled, with a compatible log forwarding plugin installed to send your application logs to New Relic. Install or update the .NET agent Install or update to the most recent .NET agent version, and enable Distributed tracing. Configure the NLog extension To configure logs in context with the NLog extension, complete the following steps: Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicJsonLayout. The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the Log Forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); newRelicFileTarget.Layout = new NewRelicJsonLayout(); newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Caution The above configuration results in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful in managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the target. archiveAboveSize maxArchiveFiles bufferSize enableArchiveFileCompression autoFlush concurrentWrites Important Though not required, using the NLog AsyncWrapper Target may help improve the performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Once you have configured the NLog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. See below for an example of this configuration using the Fluentd plugin for New Relic's log management: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy File-based configuration Configuration of the New Relic NLog extension may also be accomplished with file based configuration providers. .Config based configuration The example code below creates a logger based on settings contained in an App.config file. Instantiating Logger using .config file var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"NewRelicLog\"); logger.Info(\"Hello, New Relic!\"); Copy Sample App.config file <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?> <configuration> <configSections> <section name=\"nlog\" type=\"NLog.Config.ConfigSectionHandler, NLog\"/> </configSections> <startup> <supportedRuntime version=\"v4.0\" sku=\".NETFramework,Version=v4.5\" /> </startup> <nlog xmlns=\"http://www.nlog-project.org/schemas/NLog.xsd\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"> <extensions> <add assembly=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog\" /> </extensions> <targets> <target name=\"NewRelicLogFile\" xsi:type=\"File\" fileName=\"C:/path/to/NewRelicLog.json\"> <layout xsi:type=\"newrelic-jsonlayout\"> </layout> </target> </targets> <rules> <logger name=\"NewRelicLog\" minlevel=\"Info\" writeTo=\"newRelicLogFile\" /> </rules> </nlog> </configuration> Copy What's next?

NewRelicAppender enriches log messages with contextual information from the New Relic .NET agent if it is attached to your application. The appender passes enriched log messages to downstream appenders for specific use case log message handle. Log4net also provides NewRelicLayout to output log messages in the way required by the New Relic logging endpoint. A target can then be configured to write logging data to an output folder, which can be monitored by a log forwarder to incrementally send log information to New Relic. This diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through log4net: This diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through log4net, highlighting specific components of the New Relic log4net extension. The above diagram highlights the main components of the log4net logs in context solution: New Relic Appender: The NewRelicAppender adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans from which they were created. This appender will pass the enriched Log Events to downstream appenders for further processing. Since the NewRelicAppender is ForwardingAppender type, it needs to be the first appender in the chain and requires another appender that can write to an actual output destination as its child in order to work. New Relic Layout: The NewRelicLayout formats the enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. The appender, which this layout is assigned to, instructs log4net to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. New Relic Log Forwarder: The log forwarder monitors an output folder and incrementally sends New Relic formatted Log information to the New Relic Logging Endpoint. There are many log-forwarders available. For our examples, we will use Fluentd. For more information about logging with log4net, see the Apache log4net Getting started documentation.

In your log4net configuration file, update your logging configuration to use the NewRelicAppender as the first level appender, and reference your existing appenders as its children. You also need to replace the layout of the appender that writes log messages to an output destination with the NewRelicLayout . The following log4net configuration example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: <log4net> <root> <level value=\"ALL\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicAppender\" /> </root> <appender name=\"NewRelicAppender\" type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicAppender, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\" > <threshold value=\"ALL\"/> <appender-ref ref=\"FileAppender\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"FileAppender\" type=\"log4net.Appender.FileAppender\"> <file value=\"C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json\" /> <param name=\"AppendToFile\" value=\"true\" /> <layout type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicLayout, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\"> </layout> </appender> </log4net> Copy Once you have configured the log4net extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic Logs.

To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Test log forwarding To quickly check that the log forwarding feature works, follow these steps. If you're running the infrastructure monitoring agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the user executing nri-agent has read permissions for the data sources. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file (for example, logs.yml) with this content: Linux example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: /var/log/test.log Copy Windows example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: 'C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log' Copy Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy For example: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /var/log/test.log Copy Search New Relic Logs for test message. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. You can add as many config files as you want, and set as many sources as you need per config file. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file with the parameters you need. Use our sample config file as reference. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart it. Log forwarding parameters The log forwarder config supports the following parameters (for examples, see the sample configuration). name Name of the log or logs. attributes List of custom attributes, as key-value pairs, that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. For example, you can enable built-in parsing rules by setting the logtype attribute. Example: ... - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 format: none separator: \\t attributes: # You can add custom attributes to any source of logs tcpFormat: none logtype: nginx # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing someOtherAttribute: associatedValue Copy file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Your file can point to a specific log file or multiple ones by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log Example: logs: - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Wildcards can also be used in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files pattern: redis # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy Once you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd (Linux only) Service name. Once the systemd input is activated, log messages are collected from the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog (Linux only) Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the Infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

Some of them are inserted for any log record, while other depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the Log Forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the Entity GUID of infrastructure as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. Troubleshoot log forwarding If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the Infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\":  first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic The infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent so that the new settings can be loaded. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get this error: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher. Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next?

      "body": "You can forward your logs to New Relic using our infrastructure monitoring agent. This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by checking what you need. Install the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Configure your log sources and other parameters in the logging.d directory. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. What you need The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x and 18.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Test log forwarding To quickly check that the log forwarding feature works, follow these steps. If you're running the infrastructure monitoring agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the user executing nri-agent has read permissions for the data sources. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file (for example, logs.yml) with this content: Linux example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: /var/log/test.log Copy Windows example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: 'C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log' Copy Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy For example: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /var/log/test.log Copy Search New Relic Logs for test message. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. You can add as many config files as you want, and set as many sources as you need per config file. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file with the parameters you need. Use our sample config file as reference. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart it. Log forwarding parameters The log forwarder config supports the following parameters (for examples, see the sample configuration). name Name of the log or logs. attributes List of custom attributes, as key-value pairs, that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. For example, you can enable built-in parsing rules by setting the logtype attribute. Example: ... - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 format: none separator: \\t attributes: # You can add custom attributes to any source of logs tcpFormat: none logtype: nginx # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing someOtherAttribute: associatedValue Copy file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Your file can point to a specific log file or multiple ones by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log Example: logs: - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Wildcards can also be used in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files pattern: redis # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy Once you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd (Linux only) Service name. Once the systemd input is activated, log messages are collected from the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog (Linux only) Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the Infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

Some of them are inserted for any log record, while other depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the Log Forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the Entity GUID of infrastructure as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. Troubleshoot log forwarding If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the Infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\":  first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic The infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent so that the new settings can be loaded. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get this error: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher. Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next?

This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by checking what you need. Install the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Configure your log sources and other parameters in the logging.d directory. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. What you need The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x and 18.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Test log forwarding To quickly check that the log forwarding feature works, follow these steps. If you're running the infrastructure monitoring agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the user executing nri-agent has read permissions for the data sources. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file (for example, logs.yml) with this content: Linux example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: /var/log/test.log Copy Windows example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: 'C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log' Copy Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy For example: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /var/log/test.log Copy Search New Relic Logs for test message. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. You can add as many config files as you want, and set as many sources as you need per config file. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file with the parameters you need. Use our sample config file as reference. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart it. Log forwarding parameters The log forwarder config supports the following parameters (for examples, see the sample configuration). name Name of the log or logs. attributes List of custom attributes, as key-value pairs, that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. For example, you can enable built-in parsing rules by setting the logtype attribute. Example: ... - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 format: none separator: \\t attributes: # You can add custom attributes to any source of logs tcpFormat: none logtype: nginx # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing someOtherAttribute: associatedValue Copy file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Your file can point to a specific log file or multiple ones by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log Example: logs: - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Wildcards can also be used in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files pattern: redis # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy Once you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd (Linux only) Service name. Once the systemd input is activated, log messages are collected from the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog (Linux only) Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the Infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

Some of them are inserted for any log record, while other depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the Log Forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the Entity GUID of infrastructure as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. Troubleshoot log forwarding If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the Infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\":  first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic The infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent so that the new settings can be loaded. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get this error: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher. Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next?

This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by checking what you need. Install the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Configure your log sources and other parameters in the logging.d directory. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. What you need The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x and 18.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Test log forwarding To quickly check that the log forwarding feature works, follow these steps. If you're running the infrastructure monitoring agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the user executing nri-agent has read permissions for the data sources. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file (for example, logs.yml) with this content: Linux example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: /var/log/test.log Copy Windows example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: 'C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log' Copy Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy For example: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /var/log/test.log Copy Search New Relic Logs for test message. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. You can add as many config files as you want, and set as many sources as you need per config file. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file with the parameters you need. Use our sample config file as reference. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart it. Log forwarding parameters The log forwarder config supports the following parameters (for examples, see the sample configuration). name Name of the log or logs. attributes List of custom attributes, as key-value pairs, that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. For example, you can enable built-in parsing rules by setting the logtype attribute. Example: ... - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 format: none separator: \\t attributes: # You can add custom attributes to any source of logs tcpFormat: none logtype: nginx # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing someOtherAttribute: associatedValue Copy file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Your file can point to a specific log file or multiple ones by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log Example: logs: - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Wildcards can also be used in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files pattern: redis # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy Once you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd (Linux only) Service name. Once the systemd input is activated, log messages are collected from the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog (Linux only) Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the Infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

Some of them are inserted for any log record, while other depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the Log Forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the Entity GUID of infrastructure as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. Troubleshoot log forwarding If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the Infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\":  first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic The infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent so that the new settings can be loaded. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get this error: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher. Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next?

      "body": "You can forward your logs to New Relic using our infrastructure monitoring agent. This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by checking what you need. Install the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Configure your log sources and other parameters in the logging.d directory. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. What you need The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x and 18.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Test log forwarding To quickly check that the log forwarding feature works, follow these steps. If you're running the infrastructure monitoring agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the user executing nri-agent has read permissions for the data sources. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file (for example, logs.yml) with this content: Linux example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: /var/log/test.log Copy Windows example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: 'C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log' Copy Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy For example: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /var/log/test.log Copy Search New Relic Logs for test message. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. You can add as many config files as you want, and set as many sources as you need per config file. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file with the parameters you need. Use our sample config file as reference. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart it. Log forwarding parameters The log forwarder config supports the following parameters (for examples, see the sample configuration). name Name of the log or logs. attributes List of custom attributes, as key-value pairs, that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. For example, you can enable built-in parsing rules by setting the logtype attribute. Example: ... - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 format: none separator: \\t attributes: # You can add custom attributes to any source of logs tcpFormat: none logtype: nginx # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing someOtherAttribute: associatedValue Copy file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Your file can point to a specific log file or multiple ones by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log Example: logs: - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Wildcards can also be used in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files pattern: redis # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy Once you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd (Linux only) Service name. Once the systemd input is activated, log messages are collected from the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog (Linux only) Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the Infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

Some of them are inserted for any log record, while other depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the Log Forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the Entity GUID of infrastructure as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. Troubleshoot log forwarding If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the Infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\":  first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic The infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent so that the new settings can be loaded. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get this error: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher. Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Configure your agent to see contextual log data, such as distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts.",

Change \"LOG_FILE\" to the name of the appender you updated in the previous step. <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"LOG_FILE\" /> </appender> Copy Make sure NewRelicAsyncAppender is the appender used in your logger. Replace your root logger’s appenders with the ASYNC appender created in the previous step. <root> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> Copy Important It's important that the NewRelicAsyncAppender be the first appender to see the log message. List any other appenders after the NewRelicAsyncAppender in the <root> list. Example configuration files You can find a working example in GitHub. Here are examples of an updated logging .xml file for the Logback extension. Single console appender example Example configuration file after adding in the logging extension information. <configuration> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <!-- changed the encoder --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- added the ASYNC appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- changed the root logger --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Two-appender example This example sends New Relic logging to a file, but still sends standard logging to the console. <configuration> <appender name=\"FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>myApp.log</file> <!-- encoder changed --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender does normal console logging --> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder> <pattern>%msg%n</pattern> </encoder> </appender> <!-- The required New Relic ASYNC appender wraps the FILE appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"FILE\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- ASYNC is one of the main appenders --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> <!-- Send every message to normal console logging, as well. --> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Check for logging data To verify that you have configured the extension correctly, run your application and verify that the logging you have configured contains the following: Includes trace.id and span.id fields Is properly-formatted JSON lines If everything is configured correctly and your data is being reported, you should see data logs in the New Relic Logs UI using the query operator has: span.id/trace.id.

      "body": "You can forward your logs to New Relic using our infrastructure monitoring agent. This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by checking what you need. Install the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Configure your log sources and other parameters in the logging.d directory. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. What you need The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x and 18.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Test log forwarding To quickly check that the log forwarding feature works, follow these steps. If you're running the infrastructure monitoring agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the user executing nri-agent has read permissions for the data sources. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file (for example, logs.yml) with this content: Linux example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: /var/log/test.log Copy Windows example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: 'C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log' Copy Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy For example: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /var/log/test.log Copy Search New Relic Logs for test message. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. You can add as many config files as you want, and set as many sources as you need per config file. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file with the parameters you need. Use our sample config file as reference. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart it. Log forwarding parameters The log forwarder config supports the following parameters (for examples, see the sample configuration). name Name of the log or logs. attributes List of custom attributes, as key-value pairs, that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. For example, you can enable built-in parsing rules by setting the logtype attribute. Example: ... - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 format: none separator: \\t attributes: # You can add custom attributes to any source of logs tcpFormat: none logtype: nginx # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing someOtherAttribute: associatedValue Copy file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Your file can point to a specific log file or multiple ones by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log Example: logs: - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Wildcards can also be used in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files pattern: redis # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy Once you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd (Linux only) Service name. Once the systemd input is activated, log messages are collected from the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog (Linux only) Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the Infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

Some of them are inserted for any log record, while other depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the Log Forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the Entity GUID of infrastructure as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. Troubleshoot log forwarding If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the Infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\":  first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic The infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent so that the new settings can be loaded. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get this error: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher. Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Configure your agent to see contextual log data, such as distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts.",

      "body": "Log patterns are the fastest way to discover value in log data without searching. Log data is high volume telemetry with a low value per individual record. Searching can quickly lead to logs that provide a root cause explanation, but most data is repetitive and hard to contextualize when browsing. Patterns can make log data discoverable without spending a lot of time reading through low value data. one.newrelic.com > Logs > Patterns: Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or for configuring drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Technical overview Log patterns functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Log patterns use advanced clustering algorithms to group together similar log messages automatically. With patterns, you can: Orient more quickly through millions of logs. Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability The ability to configure this feature is dependent on role-based permissions. If you see Patterns are turned off in your Log management Patterns UI, click the Configure Patterns button and enable it. If you don't see patterns within 30 minutes of enabling the feature, there may be a lack of data with a message attribute for the system to create a pattern from. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Regional availability Availability for this feature depends on whether you have a US or EU region account: US region accounts can use log patterns. EU region accounts cannot enable log patterns at this time. Parsing limits We have a system of safety limits on memory and CPU resources when processing logs and their patterns. These parsing limits can have an impact on the data you get. For more information, see our documentation about parsing limits. Get started To start examining patterns: Go to one.newrelic.com > Log management, and use the account picker dropdown to select the target account where you want to explore patterns. In the left navigation of the Log management UI, click Patterns. The main log UI changes to show patterns that match the query in the query bar. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: The line chart shows the top 5 patterns over time. Use the time picker and query bar to adjust the results. Explore log patterns By default the log patterns UI first shows the most frequent occurrence of patterns. To sort to show the rarest patterns first, click the Count column. You can also use the query bar or attributes bar to filter your log patterns. If you want to... Do this... Understand the rate of change in patterns Look at the line chart. The color-coded patterns correspond to the plot column in the table. You can toggle individual plot patterns to narrow your focus. See the individual log messages that match each pattern Click pattern to expand the row and see a table of individual log records. To see additional records, scroll up or down. To explore an individual log in more detail, click it to open the details panel. Group and filter patterns by their attributes Use the query bar and time picker. As you apply different filters and time windows, the log patterns adjust to your new target data. Create an alert from a pattern Add the pattern to the query bar and run the query. Then click Create alert condition in the left nav. Troubleshoot log messages that haven't been clustered into a pattern Use the Logs with no pattern tab in the Log patterns UI. Clicking a specific log message will open the log message details panel you're familiar with from the Logs management page. Explore logs with no pattern The Logs with no pattern tab groups all recent log messages in your account that were not clustered into a known pattern yet. These log messages don't represent any problem or flaw in the system; they have no pattern because they are too new to have been processed by the machine learning system. This makes them valuable to explore when you want to understand what has recently changed in your environment. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: New Relic's log patterns feature automatically groups logs without a matching pattern. For example: Are any of these logs tied to a recent problem? This is a quick way to discover unique log data that is appearing for the first time in your environment. Does your log data have a new format? Sometimes the logs don't represent a problem, but a new format of log data that deviates from the data model you expect your applications to follow. Catching these logs early gives you the opportunity to ask developers to correct any deviations in their log output. The more consistent people are in the way log data is generated, the easier it becomes to use logs across a diverse set of teams. Masked attributes and wildcards Parts of the log messages in patterns are classified as variables and are substituted by masked attributes. The masking process supports and improves the clustering phase by allowing the algorithm to ignore changing details and focus on the repetitive structure. Masked attributes include: date_time ip url uuid Masked attributes are highlighted and are easy to identify, as shown in the following example. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of a pattern that has masked attributes. Log patterns extract other less trivial variables that don't belong to any masked attribute. These variables are indicated as wildcards *. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of how wildcards * group variables. Troubleshooting Here are a few reasons why you might have patterns enabled but not see any pattern data. If you're sure none of the items below are true, get help from support.newrelic.com. No data has arrived in the timeframe you're observing. Try expanding the time range you're viewing with the time picker. It's been less than 24 hours since patterns were enabled in the account. This means the ML model may not be generated for the account yet. None of the data coming in has a message field. Patterns will only be generated for values in the message field of a log record. If your logs don't contain message, there will be no data. Put the platform to work with patterns Patterns are a value that is enriched onto the existing log message as a new attribute named newrelic.logPattern. Anything you can do with logs generally can be done with log patterns, such as: Build your own dashboards with patterns, to monitor a specific pattern or group of patterns you care about. Create alerts for patterns by adding NRQL alerts. Use baseline alert conditions to detect anomalies in known log patterns.",

      "body": "Log patterns are the fastest way to discover value in log data without searching. Log data is high volume telemetry with a low value per individual record. Searching can quickly lead to logs that provide a root cause explanation, but most data is repetitive and hard to contextualize when browsing. Patterns can make log data discoverable without spending a lot of time reading through low value data. one.newrelic.com > Logs > Patterns: Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or for configuring drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Technical overview Log patterns functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Log patterns use advanced clustering algorithms to group together similar log messages automatically. With patterns, you can: Orient more quickly through millions of logs. Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability The ability to configure this feature is dependent on role-based permissions. If you see Patterns are turned off in your Log management Patterns UI, click the Configure Patterns button and enable it. If you don't see patterns within 30 minutes of enabling the feature, there may be a lack of data with a message attribute for the system to create a pattern from. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Regional availability Availability for this feature depends on whether you have a US or EU region account: US region accounts can use log patterns. EU region accounts cannot enable log patterns at this time. Parsing limits We have a system of safety limits on memory and CPU resources when processing logs and their patterns. These parsing limits can have an impact on the data you get. For more information, see our documentation about parsing limits. Get started To start examining patterns: Go to one.newrelic.com > Log management, and use the account picker dropdown to select the target account where you want to explore patterns. In the left navigation of the Log management UI, click Patterns. The main log UI changes to show patterns that match the query in the query bar. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: The line chart shows the top 5 patterns over time. Use the time picker and query bar to adjust the results. Explore log patterns By default the log patterns UI first shows the most frequent occurrence of patterns. To sort to show the rarest patterns first, click the Count column. You can also use the query bar or attributes bar to filter your log patterns. If you want to... Do this... Understand the rate of change in patterns Look at the line chart. The color-coded patterns correspond to the plot column in the table. You can toggle individual plot patterns to narrow your focus. See the individual log messages that match each pattern Click pattern to expand the row and see a table of individual log records. To see additional records, scroll up or down. To explore an individual log in more detail, click it to open the details panel. Group and filter patterns by their attributes Use the query bar and time picker. As you apply different filters and time windows, the log patterns adjust to your new target data. Create an alert from a pattern Add the pattern to the query bar and run the query. Then click Create alert condition in the left nav. Troubleshoot log messages that haven't been clustered into a pattern Use the Logs with no pattern tab in the Log patterns UI. Clicking a specific log message will open the log message details panel you're familiar with from the Logs management page. Explore logs with no pattern The Logs with no pattern tab groups all recent log messages in your account that were not clustered into a known pattern yet. These log messages don't represent any problem or flaw in the system; they have no pattern because they are too new to have been processed by the machine learning system. This makes them valuable to explore when you want to understand what has recently changed in your environment. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: New Relic's log patterns feature automatically groups logs without a matching pattern. For example: Are any of these logs tied to a recent problem? This is a quick way to discover unique log data that is appearing for the first time in your environment. Does your log data have a new format? Sometimes the logs don't represent a problem, but a new format of log data that deviates from the data model you expect your applications to follow. Catching these logs early gives you the opportunity to ask developers to correct any deviations in their log output. The more consistent people are in the way log data is generated, the easier it becomes to use logs across a diverse set of teams. Masked attributes and wildcards Parts of the log messages in patterns are classified as variables and are substituted by masked attributes. The masking process supports and improves the clustering phase by allowing the algorithm to ignore changing details and focus on the repetitive structure. Masked attributes include: date_time ip url uuid Masked attributes are highlighted and are easy to identify, as shown in the following example. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of a pattern that has masked attributes. Log patterns extract other less trivial variables that don't belong to any masked attribute. These variables are indicated as wildcards *. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of how wildcards * group variables. Troubleshooting Here are a few reasons why you might have patterns enabled but not see any pattern data. If you're sure none of the items below are true, get help from support.newrelic.com. No data has arrived in the timeframe you're observing. Try expanding the time range you're viewing with the time picker. It's been less than 24 hours since patterns were enabled in the account. This means the ML model may not be generated for the account yet. None of the data coming in has a message field. Patterns will only be generated for values in the message field of a log record. If your logs don't contain message, there will be no data. Put the platform to work with patterns Patterns are a value that is enriched onto the existing log message as a new attribute named newrelic.logPattern. Anything you can do with logs generally can be done with log patterns, such as: Build your own dashboards with patterns, to monitor a specific pattern or group of patterns you care about. Create alerts for patterns by adding NRQL alerts. Use baseline alert conditions to detect anomalies in known log patterns.",

Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why New Relic for log management? As applications move towards the cloud, microservices architecture is becoming more dispersed, making the ability to monitor logs essential. Log management provides deeper visibility into application and infrastructure performance data (events and errors) to reduce mean-time-to-resolve (MTTR) and quickly troubleshoot production incidents. It does this by providing super-fast searching capabilities, alerts, and co-location of application, infrastructure, and log data, while visualizing everything from a single pane of glass. Log management features Log management provides a way to connect your log data with the rest of your application and infrastructure data, allowing you to get to the root cause of problems quickly, without losing context switching between tools. Log management's features include: Instantly search through your logs. Visualize your log data directly from the Logs UI. Use logging data to create custom charts, dashboards, and alerts. Troubleshoot performance issues without switching between tools. Bring in your logging data You can bring your log data into New Relic using a compatible log forwarding plugin: Forward your logs using our Infrastructure agent or our Kubernetes plugin. Use our plugins for well-known log forwarders, like Fluentd, Fluent Bit, and Logstash. Stream or ship your logs from Amazon using AWS Lambda or Kinesis. Send your logs data using the Logs API. Once log management is enabled, you can also connect your logs with your APM agent, Kubernetes clusters, or distributed tracing to get additional contextual logging data with our logs in context extensions. View your logging data in New Relic Logging data can be found in these locations: In our Logs UI: Logs UI for US Logs UI for EU By querying the Log data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Log Copy For information on querying in general, see Query your data.",

      "body": "If our logging solutions don't meet your needs, you can use our Log API to send log data directly to New Relic's Log management via an HTTP endpoint. Caution Do not call our API from a customer-facing application. If you must, be sure to do it async. Compatibility and requirements Requirements include: New Relic license key (recommended) or an Insert API key. For payload details, see limits and restricted characters. Tip To use APIs and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. HTTP setup To send log data to your New Relic account: Get your New Relic license key (recommended) or register an Insert API key. Generate the JSON message using the required headers and body fields. Submit the JSON message to the HTTP endpoint in a POST request. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. HTTP headers When creating your HTTP headers, use these guidelines: Header Supported values Content-Type Required application/json json application/gzip gzip Exactly one of: Api-Key or X-License-Key Required Use either your New Relic Insert API key (with Api-Key) or license key (with X-License-Key). Gzipped JSON formatting is accepted. If sending compressed JSON, please include the Content-Type: application/json and Content-Encoding: gzip headers. JSON body You can send your JSON message using either a simplified or detailed set of attributes: Simplified JSON body message When using the simplified format to create your JSON message, send a single JSON object with the following: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Either milliseconds or seconds since epoch No If the field is not specific as millisecond or seconds since epoch, the message will be timestamped using the ingest time \"message\" String any string No This is the main log message field that is searched by default \"logtype\" String any string No Primary field for identifying logs and matching parsing rules other_fields (must not contain white space) String any string No These will become attributes of the log message Note: Log management does not support white space in attribute names Detailed JSON body message When using the detailed format to create your body, it must be a JSON array containing one or more JSON objects, each of which with the following format: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"common\" Object See common. No Any attributes that are common to all log messages \"logs\" Array See logs. Yes Array with the log entries Limits and restricted characters Restrictions on logs sent to the Log API: Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Rate limits on logs sent to the Log API: Maximum rate for HTTP requests sent to the Log API: 300,000 requests per minute Maximum rate of uncompressed Log JSON bytes sent to the Log API: 10 GB per minute Rate limit violations Exceeding rate limits affects how the Log API behaves. Follow these instructions if this happens. HTTP requests per minute When the maximum request rate limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Log API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. This response includes a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. JSON bytes per minute When the maximum Log JSON byte limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Log API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. This response includes a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, try to reduce the amount of log data you are sending, or spread it out over a larger period of time. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Log payload format We accept any valid JSON payload. The payload must encoded as UTF-8. Important Log management does not support white space in attribute names. For example, {\"Sample Attribute\": \"Value\"} would cause errors. JSON message attributes Common block attributes This is a block containing attributes that will be common to all log entries in logs: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Milliseconds or seconds since epoch No Message timestamp default to ingest time \"attributes\" Object JSON No This sub-object contains all other attributes of the message Logs block attributes This is an array containing log entries with the following format: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Milliseconds or seconds since epoch No Message timestamp default to ingest time \"attributes\" Object JSON No This sub-object contains all other attributes of the message \"message\" String (any string) Yes This is the main log message field that is searched by default \"log\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest \"LOG\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest \"MESSAGE\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest JSON message attribute parsing This will attempt to parse any message attribute as JSON. If the message attribute is JSON, it will be parsed and the resultant JSON attributes will be added to the event. If the message attribute is not JSON, it is left as is. For example, the event: { \"timestamp\": 1562767499238, \"message\": \"{\\\"service-name\\\": \\\"login-service\\\", \\\"user\\\": {\\\"id\\\": 123, \\\"name\\\": \\\"alice\\\"}}\" } Copy Will be treated as: { \"timestamp\": 1562767499238, \"message\": \"{\\\"service-name\\\": \\\"my-service\\\", \\\"user\\\": {\\\"id\\\": 123, \\\"name\\\": \\\"alice\\\"}}\", \"service-name\": \"login-service\", \"user\": { \"id\": 123, \"name\": \"alice\" } } Copy Important Log management does not support white space in attribute names. For example, {\"Sample Attribute\": \"Value\"} would cause errors. Log JSON example Attributes may be scalar JSON types like string and number, but may also be compound (or nested) objects. Compound attributes will have their leaf attributes stored with flattened names. For instance, a compound user attribute in a log entry's attributes: \"attributes\": { \"action\": \"login\", \"user\": { \"id\": 123, \"name\": \"alice\" } } Copy will result in the following attributes being stored with the log event: Attribute Value \"action\" \"login\" \"user.id\" 123 \"user.name\" \"alice\" Log POST example Log POST message example: POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Accept: */* Content-Length: 319 [{ \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } }, \"logs\": [{ \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\" },{ \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged out\", \"attributes\": { \"auditId\": 123 } }] }] Copy The above POST message would result in the following log messages being stored in Log management: Example of stored common block attributes: Attribute Value \"logtype\" \"accesslogs\" \"service\" \"login-service\" \"hostname\" \"login.example.com\" Example of stored logs block attributes example: Attribute Value \"timestamp\" 1550086450124 \"message\" \"User 'xyz' logged out\" \"auditId\" 123 HTTP endpoint Once configured, your JSON data can be sent to the following endpoint in a POST request: United States (US) endpoint: https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy European Union (EU) endpoint: https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Here's an example of a JSON POST request: POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Accept: */* Content-Length: 133 { \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\", \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } Copy Find log data For where to find data sent via the Log API (including from integrations that use that API), see Find log data.

Compatibility Make sure you've installed a compatible log forwarding plugin. Status codes Check the response status code being returned from the New Relic log collection endpoint. For example, you might see: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden. Review your license key. Copy This error means that you're using an invalid security key. New Relic requires an Insert API key or license key to enable log shipping. An HTTP 202 response is a success. Errors Run a query using the NrIntegrationErrors NRQL event to see if any errors are related to logging. For example, look for messages like: Error parsing JSON payload Copy Checking for data Try querying the Log data type.

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by checking what you need. Install the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Configure your log sources and other parameters in the logging.d directory. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. What you need The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x and 18.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Test log forwarding To quickly check that the log forwarding feature works, follow these steps. If you're running the infrastructure monitoring agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the user executing nri-agent has read permissions for the data sources. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file (for example, logs.yml) with this content: Linux example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: /var/log/test.log Copy Windows example: # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: - name: \"test_log\" file: 'C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log' Copy Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy For example: echo \"This is a test message.\" >> /var/log/test.log Copy Search New Relic Logs for test message. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. You can add as many config files as you want, and set as many sources as you need per config file. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a configuration file with the parameters you need. Use our sample config file as reference. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart it. Log forwarding parameters The log forwarder config supports the following parameters (for examples, see the sample configuration). name Name of the log or logs. attributes List of custom attributes, as key-value pairs, that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. For example, you can enable built-in parsing rules by setting the logtype attribute. Example: ... - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 format: none separator: \\t attributes: # You can add custom attributes to any source of logs tcpFormat: none logtype: nginx # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing someOtherAttribute: associatedValue Copy file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Your file can point to a specific log file or multiple ones by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log Example: logs: - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Wildcards can also be used in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files pattern: redis # Regular expression to filter log entries Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy Once you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd (Linux only) Service name. Once the systemd input is activated, log messages are collected from the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog (Linux only) Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the Infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

Some of them are inserted for any log record, while other depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the Log Forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the Entity GUID of infrastructure as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. Troubleshoot log forwarding If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the Infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\":  first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic The infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent so that the new settings can be loaded. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get this error: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher. Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next?

      "body": "Log patterns are the fastest way to discover value in log data without searching. Log data is high volume telemetry with a low value per individual record. Searching can quickly lead to logs that provide a root cause explanation, but most data is repetitive and hard to contextualize when browsing. Patterns can make log data discoverable without spending a lot of time reading through low value data. one.newrelic.com > Logs > Patterns: Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or for configuring drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Technical overview Log patterns functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Log patterns use advanced clustering algorithms to group together similar log messages automatically. With patterns, you can: Orient more quickly through millions of logs. Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability The ability to configure this feature is dependent on role-based permissions. If you see Patterns are turned off in your Log management Patterns UI, click the Configure Patterns button and enable it. If you don't see patterns within 30 minutes of enabling the feature, there may be a lack of data with a message attribute for the system to create a pattern from. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Regional availability Availability for this feature depends on whether you have a US or EU region account: US region accounts can use log patterns. EU region accounts cannot enable log patterns at this time. Parsing limits We have a system of safety limits on memory and CPU resources when processing logs and their patterns. These parsing limits can have an impact on the data you get. For more information, see our documentation about parsing limits. Get started To start examining patterns: Go to one.newrelic.com > Log management, and use the account picker dropdown to select the target account where you want to explore patterns. In the left navigation of the Log management UI, click Patterns. The main log UI changes to show patterns that match the query in the query bar. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: The line chart shows the top 5 patterns over time. Use the time picker and query bar to adjust the results. Explore log patterns By default the log patterns UI first shows the most frequent occurrence of patterns. To sort to show the rarest patterns first, click the Count column. You can also use the query bar or attributes bar to filter your log patterns. If you want to... Do this... Understand the rate of change in patterns Look at the line chart. The color-coded patterns correspond to the plot column in the table. You can toggle individual plot patterns to narrow your focus. See the individual log messages that match each pattern Click pattern to expand the row and see a table of individual log records. To see additional records, scroll up or down. To explore an individual log in more detail, click it to open the details panel. Group and filter patterns by their attributes Use the query bar and time picker. As you apply different filters and time windows, the log patterns adjust to your new target data. Create an alert from a pattern Add the pattern to the query bar and run the query. Then click Create alert condition in the left nav. Troubleshoot log messages that haven't been clustered into a pattern Use the Logs with no pattern tab in the Log patterns UI. Clicking a specific log message will open the log message details panel you're familiar with from the Logs management page. Explore logs with no pattern The Logs with no pattern tab groups all recent log messages in your account that were not clustered into a known pattern yet. These log messages don't represent any problem or flaw in the system; they have no pattern because they are too new to have been processed by the machine learning system. This makes them valuable to explore when you want to understand what has recently changed in your environment. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: New Relic's log patterns feature automatically groups logs without a matching pattern. For example: Are any of these logs tied to a recent problem? This is a quick way to discover unique log data that is appearing for the first time in your environment. Does your log data have a new format? Sometimes the logs don't represent a problem, but a new format of log data that deviates from the data model you expect your applications to follow. Catching these logs early gives you the opportunity to ask developers to correct any deviations in their log output. The more consistent people are in the way log data is generated, the easier it becomes to use logs across a diverse set of teams. Masked attributes and wildcards Parts of the log messages in patterns are classified as variables and are substituted by masked attributes. The masking process supports and improves the clustering phase by allowing the algorithm to ignore changing details and focus on the repetitive structure. Masked attributes include: date_time ip url uuid Masked attributes are highlighted and are easy to identify, as shown in the following example. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of a pattern that has masked attributes. Log patterns extract other less trivial variables that don't belong to any masked attribute. These variables are indicated as wildcards *. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of how wildcards * group variables. Troubleshooting Here are a few reasons why you might have patterns enabled but not see any pattern data. If you're sure none of the items below are true, get help from support.newrelic.com. No data has arrived in the timeframe you're observing. Try expanding the time range you're viewing with the time picker. It's been less than 24 hours since patterns were enabled in the account. This means the ML model may not be generated for the account yet. None of the data coming in has a message field. Patterns will only be generated for values in the message field of a log record. If your logs don't contain message, there will be no data. Put the platform to work with patterns Patterns are a value that is enriched onto the existing log message as a new attribute named newrelic.logPattern. Anything you can do with logs generally can be done with log patterns, such as: Build your own dashboards with patterns, to monitor a specific pattern or group of patterns you care about. Create alerts for patterns by adding NRQL alerts. Use baseline alert conditions to detect anomalies in known log patterns.",

      "body": "After log event data has been shipped to New Relic, it can either be stored in our NRDB database or dropped (discarded). We can drop both log events and event attributes via drop filter rules. You can manage drop filter rules using our Logs UI, as explained in this document. You can also use NerdGraph. Savings, security, speed Drop filter rules help you accomplish several important goals: Lower costs by storing only logs relevant to your account. Protect privacy and security by removing personal identifiable information (PII). Reduce noise by removing irrelevant events and attributes. Caution Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, review the responsibilities and considerations for dropping data. How drop filter rules work A drop filter rule matches data based on a query. When triggered, the drop filter rule removes the matching data from the ingestion pipeline before it is written to NRDB. This creates an explicit demarcation between the logs being forwarded from your domain and the data that New Relic collects. Since the data removed by the drop filter rule doesn't reach our backend, it cannot be queried: the data is gone and cannot be restored. During the ingestion process, log data can be parsed, transformed, or dropped before being stored. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic doesn't review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions can view and edit all information in the rules you create. Create drop filter rules To create and edit drop filters, you must have admin permissions in New Relic, or you must be a member of a role with create and edit permissions for Logging Parsing Rules. Once a drop filter rule is active, it's applied to all log events ingested from that point onwards. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before creating a rule are not filtered by that rule. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Filter or query the set of logs that contain the data you want to drop. Then, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. To create a new drop filter rule, you can use new or existing log queries. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Filter or query to the specific set of logs that contain the data to be dropped. Once the query is active, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. Recommendation: Change the drop rule's default name to a meaningful name. Choose to either drop the entire log event that matches the query or just a specific subset of attributes in the matching events. Review the log partitions where this drop rule applies. Save the drop filter rule. Types of drop filter rules The drop filters UI prompts you to select whether to drop logs based on the query or on specific attributes. Drop log events The default type of drop filter rule is to drop logs. This option drops the entire log events that match the filter or query. When creating a rule, try to provide a specific query that only matches log data that should be dropped. Our drop filters process won't let you create drop filter rules without values in the matching query. This prevents badly formed rules from dropping all log data. Drop attributes You can specify attributes to be dropped in a log event that matches your query. At least one or more attributes must be selected. Any attribute which is selected will be dropped; all remaining attributes will be kept and stored in NRDB.

      "body": "Log patterns are the fastest way to discover value in log data without searching. Log data is high volume telemetry with a low value per individual record. Searching can quickly lead to logs that provide a root cause explanation, but most data is repetitive and hard to contextualize when browsing. Patterns can make log data discoverable without spending a lot of time reading through low value data. one.newrelic.com > Logs > Patterns: Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or for configuring drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Technical overview Log patterns functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Log patterns use advanced clustering algorithms to group together similar log messages automatically. With patterns, you can: Orient more quickly through millions of logs. Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability The ability to configure this feature is dependent on role-based permissions. If you see Patterns are turned off in your Log management Patterns UI, click the Configure Patterns button and enable it. If you don't see patterns within 30 minutes of enabling the feature, there may be a lack of data with a message attribute for the system to create a pattern from. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Regional availability Availability for this feature depends on whether you have a US or EU region account: US region accounts can use log patterns. EU region accounts cannot enable log patterns at this time. Parsing limits We have a system of safety limits on memory and CPU resources when processing logs and their patterns. These parsing limits can have an impact on the data you get. For more information, see our documentation about parsing limits. Get started To start examining patterns: Go to one.newrelic.com > Log management, and use the account picker dropdown to select the target account where you want to explore patterns. In the left navigation of the Log management UI, click Patterns. The main log UI changes to show patterns that match the query in the query bar. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: The line chart shows the top 5 patterns over time. Use the time picker and query bar to adjust the results. Explore log patterns By default the log patterns UI first shows the most frequent occurrence of patterns. To sort to show the rarest patterns first, click the Count column. You can also use the query bar or attributes bar to filter your log patterns. If you want to... Do this... Understand the rate of change in patterns Look at the line chart. The color-coded patterns correspond to the plot column in the table. You can toggle individual plot patterns to narrow your focus. See the individual log messages that match each pattern Click pattern to expand the row and see a table of individual log records. To see additional records, scroll up or down. To explore an individual log in more detail, click it to open the details panel. Group and filter patterns by their attributes Use the query bar and time picker. As you apply different filters and time windows, the log patterns adjust to your new target data. Create an alert from a pattern Add the pattern to the query bar and run the query. Then click Create alert condition in the left nav. Troubleshoot log messages that haven't been clustered into a pattern Use the Logs with no pattern tab in the Log patterns UI. Clicking a specific log message will open the log message details panel you're familiar with from the Logs management page. Explore logs with no pattern The Logs with no pattern tab groups all recent log messages in your account that were not clustered into a known pattern yet. These log messages don't represent any problem or flaw in the system; they have no pattern because they are too new to have been processed by the machine learning system. This makes them valuable to explore when you want to understand what has recently changed in your environment. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: New Relic's log patterns feature automatically groups logs without a matching pattern. For example: Are any of these logs tied to a recent problem? This is a quick way to discover unique log data that is appearing for the first time in your environment. Does your log data have a new format? Sometimes the logs don't represent a problem, but a new format of log data that deviates from the data model you expect your applications to follow. Catching these logs early gives you the opportunity to ask developers to correct any deviations in their log output. The more consistent people are in the way log data is generated, the easier it becomes to use logs across a diverse set of teams. Masked attributes and wildcards Parts of the log messages in patterns are classified as variables and are substituted by masked attributes. The masking process supports and improves the clustering phase by allowing the algorithm to ignore changing details and focus on the repetitive structure. Masked attributes include: date_time ip url uuid Masked attributes are highlighted and are easy to identify, as shown in the following example. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of a pattern that has masked attributes. Log patterns extract other less trivial variables that don't belong to any masked attribute. These variables are indicated as wildcards *. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of how wildcards * group variables. Troubleshooting Here are a few reasons why you might have patterns enabled but not see any pattern data. If you're sure none of the items below are true, get help from support.newrelic.com. No data has arrived in the timeframe you're observing. Try expanding the time range you're viewing with the time picker. It's been less than 24 hours since patterns were enabled in the account. This means the ML model may not be generated for the account yet. None of the data coming in has a message field. Patterns will only be generated for values in the message field of a log record. If your logs don't contain message, there will be no data. Put the platform to work with patterns Patterns are a value that is enriched onto the existing log message as a new attribute named newrelic.logPattern. Anything you can do with logs generally can be done with log patterns, such as: Build your own dashboards with patterns, to monitor a specific pattern or group of patterns you care about. Create alerts for patterns by adding NRQL alerts. Use baseline alert conditions to detect anomalies in known log patterns.",

      "body": "After log event data has been shipped to New Relic, it can either be stored in our NRDB database or dropped (discarded). We can drop both log events and event attributes via drop filter rules. You can manage drop filter rules using our Logs UI, as explained in this document. You can also use NerdGraph. Savings, security, speed Drop filter rules help you accomplish several important goals: Lower costs by storing only logs relevant to your account. Protect privacy and security by removing personal identifiable information (PII). Reduce noise by removing irrelevant events and attributes. Caution Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, review the responsibilities and considerations for dropping data. How drop filter rules work A drop filter rule matches data based on a query. When triggered, the drop filter rule removes the matching data from the ingestion pipeline before it is written to NRDB. This creates an explicit demarcation between the logs being forwarded from your domain and the data that New Relic collects. Since the data removed by the drop filter rule doesn't reach our backend, it cannot be queried: the data is gone and cannot be restored. During the ingestion process, log data can be parsed, transformed, or dropped before being stored. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic doesn't review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions can view and edit all information in the rules you create. Create drop filter rules To create and edit drop filters, you must have admin permissions in New Relic, or you must be a member of a role with create and edit permissions for Logging Parsing Rules. Once a drop filter rule is active, it's applied to all log events ingested from that point onwards. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before creating a rule are not filtered by that rule. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Filter or query the set of logs that contain the data you want to drop. Then, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. To create a new drop filter rule, you can use new or existing log queries. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Filter or query to the specific set of logs that contain the data to be dropped. Once the query is active, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. Recommendation: Change the drop rule's default name to a meaningful name. Choose to either drop the entire log event that matches the query or just a specific subset of attributes in the matching events. Review the log partitions where this drop rule applies. Save the drop filter rule. Types of drop filter rules The drop filters UI prompts you to select whether to drop logs based on the query or on specific attributes. Drop log events The default type of drop filter rule is to drop logs. This option drops the entire log events that match the filter or query. When creating a rule, try to provide a specific query that only matches log data that should be dropped. Our drop filters process won't let you create drop filter rules without values in the matching query. This prevents badly formed rules from dropping all log data. Drop attributes You can specify attributes to be dropped in a log event that matches your query. At least one or more attributes must be selected. Any attribute which is selected will be dropped; all remaining attributes will be kept and stored in NRDB. Tip We recommend this method for removing fields that could contain personal identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive attributes without losing valuable monitoring data.

      "body": "Log patterns are the fastest way to discover value in log data without searching. Log data is high volume telemetry with a low value per individual record. Searching can quickly lead to logs that provide a root cause explanation, but most data is repetitive and hard to contextualize when browsing. Patterns can make log data discoverable without spending a lot of time reading through low value data. one.newrelic.com > Logs > Patterns: Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or for configuring drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Technical overview Log patterns functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Log patterns use advanced clustering algorithms to group together similar log messages automatically. With patterns, you can: Orient more quickly through millions of logs. Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability The ability to configure this feature is dependent on role-based permissions. If you see Patterns are turned off in your Log management Patterns UI, click the Configure Patterns button and enable it. If you don't see patterns within 30 minutes of enabling the feature, there may be a lack of data with a message attribute for the system to create a pattern from. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Regional availability Availability for this feature depends on whether you have a US or EU region account: US region accounts can use log patterns. EU region accounts cannot enable log patterns at this time. Parsing limits We have a system of safety limits on memory and CPU resources when processing logs and their patterns. These parsing limits can have an impact on the data you get. For more information, see our documentation about parsing limits. Get started To start examining patterns: Go to one.newrelic.com > Log management, and use the account picker dropdown to select the target account where you want to explore patterns. In the left navigation of the Log management UI, click Patterns. The main log UI changes to show patterns that match the query in the query bar. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: The line chart shows the top 5 patterns over time. Use the time picker and query bar to adjust the results. Explore log patterns By default the log patterns UI first shows the most frequent occurrence of patterns. To sort to show the rarest patterns first, click the Count column. You can also use the query bar or attributes bar to filter your log patterns. If you want to... Do this... Understand the rate of change in patterns Look at the line chart. The color-coded patterns correspond to the plot column in the table. You can toggle individual plot patterns to narrow your focus. See the individual log messages that match each pattern Click pattern to expand the row and see a table of individual log records. To see additional records, scroll up or down. To explore an individual log in more detail, click it to open the details panel. Group and filter patterns by their attributes Use the query bar and time picker. As you apply different filters and time windows, the log patterns adjust to your new target data. Create an alert from a pattern Add the pattern to the query bar and run the query. Then click Create alert condition in the left nav. Troubleshoot log messages that haven't been clustered into a pattern Use the Logs with no pattern tab in the Log patterns UI. Clicking a specific log message will open the log message details panel you're familiar with from the Logs management page. Explore logs with no pattern The Logs with no pattern tab groups all recent log messages in your account that were not clustered into a known pattern yet. These log messages don't represent any problem or flaw in the system; they have no pattern because they are too new to have been processed by the machine learning system. This makes them valuable to explore when you want to understand what has recently changed in your environment. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: New Relic's log patterns feature automatically groups logs without a matching pattern. For example: Are any of these logs tied to a recent problem? This is a quick way to discover unique log data that is appearing for the first time in your environment. Does your log data have a new format? Sometimes the logs don't represent a problem, but a new format of log data that deviates from the data model you expect your applications to follow. Catching these logs early gives you the opportunity to ask developers to correct any deviations in their log output. The more consistent people are in the way log data is generated, the easier it becomes to use logs across a diverse set of teams. Masked attributes and wildcards Parts of the log messages in patterns are classified as variables and are substituted by masked attributes. The masking process supports and improves the clustering phase by allowing the algorithm to ignore changing details and focus on the repetitive structure. Masked attributes include: date_time ip url uuid Masked attributes are highlighted and are easy to identify, as shown in the following example. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of a pattern that has masked attributes. Log patterns extract other less trivial variables that don't belong to any masked attribute. These variables are indicated as wildcards *. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of how wildcards * group variables. Troubleshooting Here are a few reasons why you might have patterns enabled but not see any pattern data. If you're sure none of the items below are true, get help from support.newrelic.com. No data has arrived in the timeframe you're observing. Try expanding the time range you're viewing with the time picker. It's been less than 24 hours since patterns were enabled in the account. This means the ML model may not be generated for the account yet. None of the data coming in has a message field. Patterns will only be generated for values in the message field of a log record. If your logs don't contain message, there will be no data. Put the platform to work with patterns Patterns are a value that is enriched onto the existing log message as a new attribute named newrelic.logPattern. Anything you can do with logs generally can be done with log patterns, such as: Build your own dashboards with patterns, to monitor a specific pattern or group of patterns you care about. Create alerts for patterns by adding NRQL alerts. Use baseline alert conditions to detect anomalies in known log patterns.",

To drill down into additional details, click any highlighted attribute. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Each log's summary provides query options to add, exclude, replace, and more. Query structure Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as new and relic, or phrases such as new relic agent, directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries. Tip Logs queries are based on the Lucene query language. For some helpful examples, check out this Lucene tutorial. General query rules: Log query rules Comments Case sensitive The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive. Exception: Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values. Special characters When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (\\). This includes special characters such as +, -, &, |, !, (, ), {, }, [, ], ^, \", ~, *, ?, :, /, or \\. Example: To query for \"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202, escape the quotes like this: \"\\\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\\\" 202\" Wildcard searches You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (*) to replace zero or more characters. Example: new*relic Search with text To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases. Text operators The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators: Condition Text operator example Matching (keyword) Search for log results containing keywords entered separately: \"new\" \"relic\" Exact matching (phrase) Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered: \"new relic agent\" Either / Or Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered: new OR relic And Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered: new AND relic * Wildcard (zero or more) Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them: new*relic Negation (keyword) Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered: -new Negation (phrase) Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered. -\"new relic\" Search with attributes Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field. General operators The following operators can be used by all types of attributes: Condition General operator example Equal : Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname equals chi: hostname:chi Does not equal - : Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname does not equal chi. -hostname:chi Contains * Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname contains chi. hostname:*chi* Does not contain - * Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname does not contain chi. -hostname:*chi* Starts with * Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname starts with chi. hostname:chi* Ends with * Search for log results where the attribute ends with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname ends with chi. hostname:*chi Has Search for log results that have the specified field. Example: Has the field user_name. has:user_name Missing Search for log results that are missing the specified field. Example: Missing the field user_name. missing:user_name Numeric operators The following operators can only be used by numeric attributes: Condition Numeric operator example Greater than Search for log results attribute matches that are greater than the given parameter.

This in turn helps you build better charts and alerts. one.newrelic.com > Logs: From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Parsing, then create a your own custom parsing rule with an attribute, value, and Grok pattern. New Relic parses log data according to rules. Learn how logs parsing works, how to use built-in rules, and how to create custom rules. Example A good example is a default NGINX access log containing unstructured text. It is useful for searching but not much else. Here's an example of a typical line: 127.180.71.3 - - [10/May/1997:08:05:32 +0000] \"GET /downloads/product_1 HTTP/1.1\" 304 0 \"-\" \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.21)\" Copy In an unparsed format, you would need to do a full text search to answer most questions. After parsing, the log is organized into attributes, like response code and request URL: { \"remote_addr\":\"93.180.71.3\", \"time\":\"1586514731\", \"method\":\"GET\", \"path\":\"/downloads/product_1\", \"version\":\"HTTP/1.1\", \"response\":\"304\", \"bytesSent\": 0, \"user_agent\": \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.21)\" } Copy Parsing makes it easier to create custom queries that facet on those values. This helps you understand the distribution of response codes per request URL and quickly find problematic pages. How log parsing works Here's an overview of how New Relic implements parsing of logs: Log parsing How it works What All parsing takes place against the message field; no other fields can be parsed. Each parsing rule has a matching criteria. We recommend using the logtype attribute name for matching parsing rules to logs. When Parsing will only be applied once to each log message. If multiple parsing rules match the log, only the first that succeeds will be applied. Parsing takes place during log ingestion, before data is written to NRDB. Once data has been written to storage, it can no longer be parsed. How Rules can be written in Grok, regex, or a mixture of the two. Grok is a collection of patterns that abstract away complicated regular expressions. If the content of the message field is JSON, it will be parsed automatically. New Relic's log ingestion pipeline can parse data by matching a log event to a rule that describes how the log should be parsed. There are two ways log events can be parsed: Use a built-in rule. Define a custom rule. Rules are a combination of matching logic and parsing logic. Matching is done by defining a query match on an attribute of the logs. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before a rule is created are not parsed by that rule. The simplest way to organize your logs and how they are parsed is to include the logtype field in your log event. This tells New Relic what built-in ruleset to apply to the logs. Important Once a parsing rule is active, data parsed by the rule is permanently changed. This cannot be reverted. Limits Parsing is computationally expensive, which introduces risk. Parsing is done for custom rules defined in an account and for matching patterns to a log. A large number of patterns or poorly defined custom rules will consume a huge amount of memory and CPU resources while also taking a very long time to complete. In order to prevent problems, we apply two parsing limits: per-message-per-rule and per-account. Limit Description Per-message-per-rule The per-message-per-rule limit prevents the time spent parsing any single message from being greater than 100 ms. If that limit is reached, the system will cease attempting to parse the log message with that rule. The ingestion pipeline will attempt to run any other applicable on that message, and the message will still be passed through the ingestion pipeline and stored in NRDB. The log message will be in its original, unparsed format. Per-account The per-account limit exists to prevent accounts from using more than their fair share of resources. The limit considers the total time spent processing all log messages for an account per-minute. The limit is not a fixed value; it scales up or down proportionally to the volume of data stored daily by the account and the environment size that is subsequently allocated to support that customer. Tip To easily check if your rate limits have been reached, go to your system Limits page in the New Relic UI. Built-in parsing rulesets Common log formats have well-established parsing rules already created for them. To get the benefit of built-in parsing rules, add the logtype attribute when forwarding logs. Set the value to something listed in the following table, and the rules for that type of log will be applied automatically. List of built-in rulesets The following logtype attribute values map to a standard parsing rulesets. See Built-in parsing rules to learn what fields are parsed for each rules. logtype Example matching query alb AWS Application Load Balancer logtype:alb apache Apache Access logtype:apache cloudfront-web CloudFront Web logtype:cloudfront-web elb Amazon Elastic Load Balancer logtype:elb iis_w3c IIS server logs - W3C format logtype:iis_w3c monit Monit logs logtype:monit mysql-error MySQL Error logtype:mysql-error nginx NGINX access logs logtype:nginx nginx-error NGINX error logs logtype:nginx-error route-53 Amazon Route 53 logs logtype:route-53 syslog-rfc5424 Syslog logtype:syslog-rfc5424 Add the logtype attribute When aggregating logs, it's important to provide metadata that makes it easy to organize, search, and parse those logs. One simple way of doing this is to add the attribute logtype to the log messages when they are shipped. Built-in parsing rules are applied by default to certain logtype values. Here are some examples of how to add logtype to logs sent by some of our supported shipping methods. New Relic infrastructure agent example Add logtype as an attribute. You must set the logtype for each named source. logs: - name: file-simple file: /path/to/file attributes: logtype: fileRaw - name: nginx-example file: /var/log/nginx.log attributes: logtype: nginx Copy Fluentd example Add a filter block to the .conf file, which uses a record_transformer to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluentd examples. <filter containers> @type record_transformer enable_ruby true <record> #Add logtype to trigger a built-in parsing rule for nginx access logs logtype nginx #Set timestamp from the value contained in the field \"time\" timestamp record[\"time\"] #Add hostname and tag fields to all records hostname \"#{Socket.gethostname}\" tag ${tag} </record> </filter> Copy Fluent Bit example Add a filter block to the .conf file that uses a record_modifier to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluent Bit examples. [FILTER] Name record_modifier Match * Record logtype nginx Record hostname ${HOSTNAME} Record service_name Sample-App-Name Copy Logstash example Add a filter block to the Logstash configuration which uses an add_field mutate filter to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Logstash examples. filter { mutate { add_field => { \"logtype\" => \"nginx\" \"service_name\" => \"myservicename\" \"hostname\" => \"%{host}\" } } } Copy Logs API example You can add attributes to the JSON request sent to New Relic. In this example we add a logtype attribute of value nginx to trigger the built-in NGINX parsing rule. Learn more about using the Logs API. POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Accept: */* Content-Length: 133 { \"timestamp\": TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\", \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } Copy Create custom parsing rules Many logs are formatted or structured in a unique way. In order to parse them, custom logic must be built and applied. one.newrelic.com > Logs: From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Parsing, then create a your own custom parsing rule with an attribute, value, and Grok pattern.

      "body": "After log event data has been shipped to New Relic, it can either be stored in our NRDB database or dropped (discarded). We can drop both log events and event attributes via drop filter rules. You can manage drop filter rules using our Logs UI, as explained in this document. You can also use NerdGraph. Savings, security, speed Drop filter rules help you accomplish several important goals: Lower costs by storing only logs relevant to your account. Protect privacy and security by removing personal identifiable information (PII). Reduce noise by removing irrelevant events and attributes. Caution Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, review the responsibilities and considerations for dropping data. How drop filter rules work A drop filter rule matches data based on a query. When triggered, the drop filter rule removes the matching data from the ingestion pipeline before it is written to NRDB. This creates an explicit demarcation between the logs being forwarded from your domain and the data that New Relic collects. Since the data removed by the drop filter rule doesn't reach our backend, it cannot be queried: the data is gone and cannot be restored. During the ingestion process, log data can be parsed, transformed, or dropped before being stored. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic doesn't review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions can view and edit all information in the rules you create. Create drop filter rules To create and edit drop filters, you must have admin permissions in New Relic, or you must be a member of a role with create and edit permissions for Logging Parsing Rules. Once a drop filter rule is active, it's applied to all log events ingested from that point onwards. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before creating a rule are not filtered by that rule. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Filter or query the set of logs that contain the data you want to drop. Then, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. To create a new drop filter rule, you can use new or existing log queries. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Filter or query to the specific set of logs that contain the data to be dropped. Once the query is active, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. Recommendation: Change the drop rule's default name to a meaningful name. Choose to either drop the entire log event that matches the query or just a specific subset of attributes in the matching events. Review the log partitions where this drop rule applies. Save the drop filter rule. Types of drop filter rules The drop filters UI prompts you to select whether to drop logs based on the query or on specific attributes. Drop log events The default type of drop filter rule is to drop logs. This option drops the entire log events that match the filter or query. When creating a rule, try to provide a specific query that only matches log data that should be dropped. Our drop filters process won't let you create drop filter rules without values in the matching query. This prevents badly formed rules from dropping all log data. Drop attributes You can specify attributes to be dropped in a log event that matches your query. At least one or more attributes must be selected. Any attribute which is selected will be dropped; all remaining attributes will be kept and stored in NRDB. Tip We recommend this method for removing fields that could contain personal identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive attributes without losing valuable monitoring data. View or delete drop filter rules To view or delete a drop filter rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Drop filters. Click the delete icon next to the drop filter rule you want to remove. Once deleted, rules no longer filter ingested log events.",

To drill down into additional details, click any highlighted attribute. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Each log's summary provides query options to add, exclude, replace, and more. Query structure Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as new and relic, or phrases such as new relic agent, directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries. Tip Logs queries are based on the Lucene query language. For some helpful examples, check out this Lucene tutorial. General query rules: Log query rules Comments Case sensitive The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive. Exception: Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values. Special characters When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (\\). This includes special characters such as +, -, &, |, !, (, ), {, }, [, ], ^, \", ~, *, ?, :, /, or \\. Example: To query for \"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202, escape the quotes like this: \"\\\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\\\" 202\" Wildcard searches You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (*) to replace zero or more characters. Example: new*relic Search with text To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases. Text operators The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators: Condition Text operator example Matching (keyword) Search for log results containing keywords entered separately: \"new\" \"relic\" Exact matching (phrase) Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered: \"new relic agent\" Either / Or Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered: new OR relic And Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered: new AND relic * Wildcard (zero or more) Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them: new*relic Negation (keyword) Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered: -new Negation (phrase) Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered. -\"new relic\" Search with attributes Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field. General operators The following operators can be used by all types of attributes: Condition General operator example Equal : Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname equals chi: hostname:chi Does not equal - : Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname does not equal chi. -hostname:chi Contains * Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname contains chi. hostname:*chi* Does not contain - * Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname does not contain chi. -hostname:*chi* Starts with * Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname starts with chi. hostname:chi* Ends with * Search for log results where the attribute ends with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname ends with chi. hostname:*chi Has Search for log results that have the specified field. Example: Has the field user_name. has:user_name Missing Search for log results that are missing the specified field. Example: Missing the field user_name. missing:user_name Numeric operators The following operators can only be used by numeric attributes: Condition Numeric operator example Greater than Search for log results attribute matches that are greater than the given parameter. Example: The field http_response_time_ms is greater than 500. http_response_time_ms:>500 Greater than or equal to Search for log results with attribute matches that are greater than or equal to the given parameter.

This in turn helps you build better charts and alerts. one.newrelic.com > Logs: From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Parsing, then create a your own custom parsing rule with an attribute, value, and Grok pattern. New Relic parses log data according to rules. Learn how logs parsing works, how to use built-in rules, and how to create custom rules. Example A good example is a default NGINX access log containing unstructured text. It is useful for searching but not much else. Here's an example of a typical line: 127.180.71.3 - - [10/May/1997:08:05:32 +0000] \"GET /downloads/product_1 HTTP/1.1\" 304 0 \"-\" \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.21)\" Copy In an unparsed format, you would need to do a full text search to answer most questions. After parsing, the log is organized into attributes, like response code and request URL: { \"remote_addr\":\"93.180.71.3\", \"time\":\"1586514731\", \"method\":\"GET\", \"path\":\"/downloads/product_1\", \"version\":\"HTTP/1.1\", \"response\":\"304\", \"bytesSent\": 0, \"user_agent\": \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.21)\" } Copy Parsing makes it easier to create custom queries that facet on those values. This helps you understand the distribution of response codes per request URL and quickly find problematic pages. How log parsing works Here's an overview of how New Relic implements parsing of logs: Log parsing How it works What All parsing takes place against the message field; no other fields can be parsed. Each parsing rule has a matching criteria. We recommend using the logtype attribute name for matching parsing rules to logs. When Parsing will only be applied once to each log message. If multiple parsing rules match the log, only the first that succeeds will be applied. Parsing takes place during log ingestion, before data is written to NRDB. Once data has been written to storage, it can no longer be parsed. How Rules can be written in Grok, regex, or a mixture of the two. Grok is a collection of patterns that abstract away complicated regular expressions. If the content of the message field is JSON, it will be parsed automatically. New Relic's log ingestion pipeline can parse data by matching a log event to a rule that describes how the log should be parsed. There are two ways log events can be parsed: Use a built-in rule. Define a custom rule. Rules are a combination of matching logic and parsing logic. Matching is done by defining a query match on an attribute of the logs. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before a rule is created are not parsed by that rule. The simplest way to organize your logs and how they are parsed is to include the logtype field in your log event. This tells New Relic what built-in ruleset to apply to the logs. Important Once a parsing rule is active, data parsed by the rule is permanently changed. This cannot be reverted. Limits Parsing is computationally expensive, which introduces risk. Parsing is done for custom rules defined in an account and for matching patterns to a log. A large number of patterns or poorly defined custom rules will consume a huge amount of memory and CPU resources while also taking a very long time to complete. In order to prevent problems, we apply two parsing limits: per-message-per-rule and per-account. Limit Description Per-message-per-rule The per-message-per-rule limit prevents the time spent parsing any single message from being greater than 100 ms. If that limit is reached, the system will cease attempting to parse the log message with that rule. The ingestion pipeline will attempt to run any other applicable on that message, and the message will still be passed through the ingestion pipeline and stored in NRDB. The log message will be in its original, unparsed format. Per-account The per-account limit exists to prevent accounts from using more than their fair share of resources. The limit considers the total time spent processing all log messages for an account per-minute. The limit is not a fixed value; it scales up or down proportionally to the volume of data stored daily by the account and the environment size that is subsequently allocated to support that customer. Tip To easily check if your rate limits have been reached, go to your system Limits page in the New Relic UI. Built-in parsing rulesets Common log formats have well-established parsing rules already created for them. To get the benefit of built-in parsing rules, add the logtype attribute when forwarding logs. Set the value to something listed in the following table, and the rules for that type of log will be applied automatically. List of built-in rulesets The following logtype attribute values map to a standard parsing rulesets. See Built-in parsing rules to learn what fields are parsed for each rules. logtype Example matching query alb AWS Application Load Balancer logtype:alb apache Apache Access logtype:apache cloudfront-web CloudFront Web logtype:cloudfront-web elb Amazon Elastic Load Balancer logtype:elb iis_w3c IIS server logs - W3C format logtype:iis_w3c monit Monit logs logtype:monit mysql-error MySQL Error logtype:mysql-error nginx NGINX access logs logtype:nginx nginx-error NGINX error logs logtype:nginx-error route-53 Amazon Route 53 logs logtype:route-53 syslog-rfc5424 Syslog logtype:syslog-rfc5424 Add the logtype attribute When aggregating logs, it's important to provide metadata that makes it easy to organize, search, and parse those logs. One simple way of doing this is to add the attribute logtype to the log messages when they are shipped. Built-in parsing rules are applied by default to certain logtype values. Here are some examples of how to add logtype to logs sent by some of our supported shipping methods. New Relic infrastructure agent example Add logtype as an attribute. You must set the logtype for each named source. logs: - name: file-simple file: /path/to/file attributes: logtype: fileRaw - name: nginx-example file: /var/log/nginx.log attributes: logtype: nginx Copy Fluentd example Add a filter block to the .conf file, which uses a record_transformer to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluentd examples. <filter containers> @type record_transformer enable_ruby true <record> #Add logtype to trigger a built-in parsing rule for nginx access logs logtype nginx #Set timestamp from the value contained in the field \"time\" timestamp record[\"time\"] #Add hostname and tag fields to all records hostname \"#{Socket.gethostname}\" tag ${tag} </record> </filter> Copy Fluent Bit example Add a filter block to the .conf file that uses a record_modifier to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluent Bit examples. [FILTER] Name record_modifier Match * Record logtype nginx Record hostname ${HOSTNAME} Record service_name Sample-App-Name Copy Logstash example Add a filter block to the Logstash configuration which uses an add_field mutate filter to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Logstash examples. filter { mutate { add_field => { \"logtype\" => \"nginx\" \"service_name\" => \"myservicename\" \"hostname\" => \"%{host}\" } } } Copy Logs API example You can add attributes to the JSON request sent to New Relic. In this example we add a logtype attribute of value nginx to trigger the built-in NGINX parsing rule. Learn more about using the Logs API. POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Accept: */* Content-Length: 133 { \"timestamp\": TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\", \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } Copy Create custom parsing rules Many logs are formatted or structured in a unique way. In order to parse them, custom logic must be built and applied. one.newrelic.com > Logs: From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Parsing, then create a your own custom parsing rule with an attribute, value, and Grok pattern.

      "body": "Log patterns are the fastest way to discover value in log data without searching. Log data is high volume telemetry with a low value per individual record. Searching can quickly lead to logs that provide a root cause explanation, but most data is repetitive and hard to contextualize when browsing. Patterns can make log data discoverable without spending a lot of time reading through low value data. one.newrelic.com > Logs > Patterns: Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or for configuring drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Technical overview Log patterns functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Log patterns use advanced clustering algorithms to group together similar log messages automatically. With patterns, you can: Orient more quickly through millions of logs. Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability The ability to configure this feature is dependent on role-based permissions. If you see Patterns are turned off in your Log management Patterns UI, click the Configure Patterns button and enable it. If you don't see patterns within 30 minutes of enabling the feature, there may be a lack of data with a message attribute for the system to create a pattern from. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Regional availability Availability for this feature depends on whether you have a US or EU region account: US region accounts can use log patterns. EU region accounts cannot enable log patterns at this time. Parsing limits We have a system of safety limits on memory and CPU resources when processing logs and their patterns. These parsing limits can have an impact on the data you get. For more information, see our documentation about parsing limits. Get started To start examining patterns: Go to one.newrelic.com > Log management, and use the account picker dropdown to select the target account where you want to explore patterns. In the left navigation of the Log management UI, click Patterns. The main log UI changes to show patterns that match the query in the query bar. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: The line chart shows the top 5 patterns over time.

      "body": "After log event data has been shipped to New Relic, it can either be stored in our NRDB database or dropped (discarded). We can drop both log events and event attributes via drop filter rules. You can manage drop filter rules using our Logs UI, as explained in this document. You can also use NerdGraph. Savings, security, speed Drop filter rules help you accomplish several important goals: Lower costs by storing only logs relevant to your account. Protect privacy and security by removing personal identifiable information (PII). Reduce noise by removing irrelevant events and attributes. Caution Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, review the responsibilities and considerations for dropping data. How drop filter rules work A drop filter rule matches data based on a query. When triggered, the drop filter rule removes the matching data from the ingestion pipeline before it is written to NRDB. This creates an explicit demarcation between the logs being forwarded from your domain and the data that New Relic collects. Since the data removed by the drop filter rule doesn't reach our backend, it cannot be queried: the data is gone and cannot be restored. During the ingestion process, log data can be parsed, transformed, or dropped before being stored. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic doesn't review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions can view and edit all information in the rules you create. Create drop filter rules To create and edit drop filters, you must have admin permissions in New Relic, or you must be a member of a role with create and edit permissions for Logging Parsing Rules. Once a drop filter rule is active, it's applied to all log events ingested from that point onwards. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before creating a rule are not filtered by that rule. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Filter or query the set of logs that contain the data you want to drop. Then, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. To create a new drop filter rule, you can use new or existing log queries. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Filter or query to the specific set of logs that contain the data to be dropped. Once the query is active, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. Recommendation: Change the drop rule's default name to a meaningful name. Choose to either drop the entire log event that matches the query or just a specific subset of attributes in the matching events. Review the log partitions where this drop rule applies. Save the drop filter rule. Types of drop filter rules The drop filters UI prompts you to select whether to drop logs based on the query or on specific attributes. Drop log events The default type of drop filter rule is to drop logs. This option drops the entire log events that match the filter or query. When creating a rule, try to provide a specific query that only matches log data that should be dropped. Our drop filters process won't let you create drop filter rules without values in the matching query. This prevents badly formed rules from dropping all log data. Drop attributes You can specify attributes to be dropped in a log event that matches your query. At least one or more attributes must be selected. Any attribute which is selected will be dropped; all remaining attributes will be kept and stored in NRDB. Tip We recommend this method for removing fields that could contain personal identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive attributes without losing valuable monitoring data. View or delete drop filter rules To view or delete a drop filter rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Drop filters. Click the delete icon next to the drop filter rule you want to remove. Once deleted, rules no longer filter ingested log events.",

To drill down into additional details, click any highlighted attribute. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Each log's summary provides query options to add, exclude, replace, and more. Query structure Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as new and relic, or phrases such as new relic agent, directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries. Tip Logs queries are based on the Lucene query language. For some helpful examples, check out this Lucene tutorial. General query rules: Log query rules Comments Case sensitive The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive. Exception: Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values. Special characters When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (\\). This includes special characters such as +, -, &, |, !, (, ), {, }, [, ], ^, \", ~, *, ?, :, /, or \\. Example: To query for \"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202, escape the quotes like this: \"\\\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\\\" 202\" Wildcard searches You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (*) to replace zero or more characters. Example: new*relic Search with text To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases. Text operators The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators: Condition Text operator example Matching (keyword) Search for log results containing keywords entered separately: \"new\" \"relic\" Exact matching (phrase) Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered: \"new relic agent\" Either / Or Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered: new OR relic And Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered: new AND relic * Wildcard (zero or more) Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them: new*relic Negation (keyword) Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered: -new Negation (phrase) Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered. -\"new relic\" Search with attributes Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field. General operators The following operators can be used by all types of attributes: Condition General operator example Equal : Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname equals chi: hostname:chi Does not equal - : Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname does not equal chi. -hostname:chi Contains * Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname contains chi. hostname:*chi* Does not contain - * Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname does not contain chi. -hostname:*chi* Starts with * Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname starts with chi. hostname:chi* Ends with * Search for log results where the attribute ends with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname ends with chi. hostname:*chi Has Search for log results that have the specified field. Example: Has the field user_name. has:user_name Missing Search for log results that are missing the specified field. Example: Missing the field user_name. missing:user_name Numeric operators The following operators can only be used by numeric attributes: Condition Numeric operator example Greater than Search for log results attribute matches that are greater than the given parameter. Example: The field http_response_time_ms is greater than 500. http_response_time_ms:>500 Greater than or equal to Search for log results with attribute matches that are greater than or equal to the given parameter.

      "body": "Log patterns are the fastest way to discover value in log data without searching. Log data is high volume telemetry with a low value per individual record. Searching can quickly lead to logs that provide a root cause explanation, but most data is repetitive and hard to contextualize when browsing. Patterns can make log data discoverable without spending a lot of time reading through low value data. one.newrelic.com > Logs > Patterns: Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or for configuring drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Technical overview Log patterns functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Log patterns use advanced clustering algorithms to group together similar log messages automatically. With patterns, you can: Orient more quickly through millions of logs. Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability The ability to configure this feature is dependent on role-based permissions. If you see Patterns are turned off in your Log management Patterns UI, click the Configure Patterns button and enable it. If you don't see patterns within 30 minutes of enabling the feature, there may be a lack of data with a message attribute for the system to create a pattern from. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Regional availability Availability for this feature depends on whether you have a US or EU region account: US region accounts can use log patterns. EU region accounts cannot enable log patterns at this time. Parsing limits We have a system of safety limits on memory and CPU resources when processing logs and their patterns. These parsing limits can have an impact on the data you get. For more information, see our documentation about parsing limits. Get started To start examining patterns: Go to one.newrelic.com > Log management, and use the account picker dropdown to select the target account where you want to explore patterns.

Savings, security, speed Drop filter rules help you accomplish several important goals: Lower costs by storing only logs relevant to your account. Protect privacy and security by removing personal identifiable information (PII). Reduce noise by removing irrelevant events and attributes. Caution Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, review the responsibilities and considerations for dropping data. How drop filter rules work A drop filter rule matches data based on a query. When triggered, the drop filter rule removes the matching data from the ingestion pipeline before it is written to NRDB. This creates an explicit demarcation between the logs being forwarded from your domain and the data that New Relic collects. Since the data removed by the drop filter rule doesn't reach our backend, it cannot be queried: the data is gone and cannot be restored. During the ingestion process, log data can be parsed, transformed, or dropped before being stored. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic doesn't review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions can view and edit all information in the rules you create. Create drop filter rules To create and edit drop filters, you must have admin permissions in New Relic, or you must be a member of a role with create and edit permissions for Logging Parsing Rules. Once a drop filter rule is active, it's applied to all log events ingested from that point onwards. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before creating a rule are not filtered by that rule. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Filter or query the set of logs that contain the data you want to drop. Then, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. To create a new drop filter rule, you can use new or existing log queries. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Filter or query to the specific set of logs that contain the data to be dropped. Once the query is active, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. Recommendation: Change the drop rule's default name to a meaningful name. Choose to either drop the entire log event that matches the query or just a specific subset of attributes in the matching events. Review the log partitions where this drop rule applies. Save the drop filter rule. Types of drop filter rules The drop filters UI prompts you to select whether to drop logs based on the query or on specific attributes. Drop log events The default type of drop filter rule is to drop logs. This option drops the entire log events that match the filter or query. When creating a rule, try to provide a specific query that only matches log data that should be dropped. Our drop filters process won't let you create drop filter rules without values in the matching query. This prevents badly formed rules from dropping all log data. Drop attributes You can specify attributes to be dropped in a log event that matches your query. At least one or more attributes must be selected. Any attribute which is selected will be dropped; all remaining attributes will be kept and stored in NRDB. Tip We recommend this method for removing fields that could contain personal identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive attributes without losing valuable monitoring data. View or delete drop filter rules To view or delete a drop filter rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Drop filters. Click the delete icon next to the drop filter rule you want to remove. Once deleted, rules no longer filter ingested log events.",

      "body": "Parsing is the process of splitting unstructured log data into attribute/value pairs. You can use these attributes to facet or filter logs in useful ways. This in turn helps you build better charts and alerts. one.newrelic.com > Logs: From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Parsing, then create a your own custom parsing rule with an attribute, value, and Grok pattern. New Relic parses log data according to rules. Learn how logs parsing works, how to use built-in rules, and how to create custom rules. Example A good example is a default NGINX access log containing unstructured text. It is useful for searching but not much else. Here's an example of a typical line: 127.180.71.3 - - [10/May/1997:08:05:32 +0000] \"GET /downloads/product_1 HTTP/1.1\" 304 0 \"-\" \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.21)\" Copy In an unparsed format, you would need to do a full text search to answer most questions. After parsing, the log is organized into attributes, like response code and request URL: { \"remote_addr\":\"93.180.71.3\", \"time\":\"1586514731\", \"method\":\"GET\", \"path\":\"/downloads/product_1\", \"version\":\"HTTP/1.1\", \"response\":\"304\", \"bytesSent\": 0, \"user_agent\": \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.21)\" } Copy Parsing makes it easier to create custom queries that facet on those values. This helps you understand the distribution of response codes per request URL and quickly find problematic pages. How log parsing works Here's an overview of how New Relic implements parsing of logs: Log parsing How it works What All parsing takes place against the message field; no other fields can be parsed. Each parsing rule has a matching criteria. We recommend using the logtype attribute name for matching parsing rules to logs. When Parsing will only be applied once to each log message. If multiple parsing rules match the log, only the first that succeeds will be applied. Parsing takes place during log ingestion, before data is written to NRDB. Once data has been written to storage, it can no longer be parsed. How Rules can be written in Grok, regex, or a mixture of the two. Grok is a collection of patterns that abstract away complicated regular expressions. If the content of the message field is JSON, it will be parsed automatically. New Relic's log ingestion pipeline can parse data by matching a log event to a rule that describes how the log should be parsed. There are two ways log events can be parsed: Use a built-in rule. Define a custom rule. Rules are a combination of matching logic and parsing logic. Matching is done by defining a query match on an attribute of the logs. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before a rule is created are not parsed by that rule. The simplest way to organize your logs and how they are parsed is to include the logtype field in your log event. This tells New Relic what built-in ruleset to apply to the logs. Important Once a parsing rule is active, data parsed by the rule is permanently changed. This cannot be reverted. Limits Parsing is computationally expensive, which introduces risk. Parsing is done for custom rules defined in an account and for matching patterns to a log. A large number of patterns or poorly defined custom rules will consume a huge amount of memory and CPU resources while also taking a very long time to complete. In order to prevent problems, we apply two parsing limits: per-message-per-rule and per-account. Limit Description Per-message-per-rule The per-message-per-rule limit prevents the time spent parsing any single message from being greater than 100 ms. If that limit is reached, the system will cease attempting to parse the log message with that rule. The ingestion pipeline will attempt to run any other applicable on that message, and the message will still be passed through the ingestion pipeline and stored in NRDB. The log message will be in its original, unparsed format. Per-account The per-account limit exists to prevent accounts from using more than their fair share of resources. The limit considers the total time spent processing all log messages for an account per-minute. The limit is not a fixed value; it scales up or down proportionally to the volume of data stored daily by the account and the environment size that is subsequently allocated to support that customer. Tip To easily check if your rate limits have been reached, go to your system Limits page in the New Relic UI. Built-in parsing rulesets Common log formats have well-established parsing rules already created for them. To get the benefit of built-in parsing rules, add the logtype attribute when forwarding logs. Set the value to something listed in the following table, and the rules for that type of log will be applied automatically. List of built-in rulesets The following logtype attribute values map to a standard parsing rulesets. See Built-in parsing rules to learn what fields are parsed for each rules. logtype Example matching query alb AWS Application Load Balancer logtype:alb apache Apache Access logtype:apache cloudfront-web CloudFront Web logtype:cloudfront-web elb Amazon Elastic Load Balancer logtype:elb iis_w3c IIS server logs - W3C format logtype:iis_w3c monit Monit logs logtype:monit mysql-error MySQL Error logtype:mysql-error nginx NGINX access logs logtype:nginx nginx-error NGINX error logs logtype:nginx-error route-53 Amazon Route 53 logs logtype:route-53 syslog-rfc5424 Syslog logtype:syslog-rfc5424 Add the logtype attribute When aggregating logs, it's important to provide metadata that makes it easy to organize, search, and parse those logs. One simple way of doing this is to add the attribute logtype to the log messages when they are shipped. Built-in parsing rules are applied by default to certain logtype values. Here are some examples of how to add logtype to logs sent by some of our supported shipping methods. New Relic infrastructure agent example Add logtype as an attribute. You must set the logtype for each named source. logs: - name: file-simple file: /path/to/file attributes: logtype: fileRaw - name: nginx-example file: /var/log/nginx.log attributes: logtype: nginx Copy Fluentd example Add a filter block to the .conf file, which uses a record_transformer to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluentd examples. <filter containers> @type record_transformer enable_ruby true <record> #Add logtype to trigger a built-in parsing rule for nginx access logs logtype nginx #Set timestamp from the value contained in the field \"time\" timestamp record[\"time\"] #Add hostname and tag fields to all records hostname \"#{Socket.gethostname}\" tag ${tag} </record> </filter> Copy Fluent Bit example Add a filter block to the .conf file that uses a record_modifier to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluent Bit examples. [FILTER] Name record_modifier Match * Record logtype nginx Record hostname ${HOSTNAME} Record service_name Sample-App-Name Copy Logstash example Add a filter block to the Logstash configuration which uses an add_field mutate filter to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Logstash examples. filter { mutate { add_field => { \"logtype\" => \"nginx\" \"service_name\" => \"myservicename\" \"hostname\" => \"%{host}\" } } } Copy Logs API example You can add attributes to the JSON request sent to New Relic. In this example we add a logtype attribute of value nginx to trigger the built-in NGINX parsing rule. Learn more about using the Logs API. POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Accept: */* Content-Length: 133 { \"timestamp\": TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\", \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } Copy Create custom parsing rules Many logs are formatted or structured in a unique way. In order to parse them, custom logic must be built and applied. one.newrelic.com > Logs: From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Parsing, then create a your own custom parsing rule with an attribute, value, and Grok pattern.

      "body": "Log patterns are the fastest way to discover value in log data without searching. Log data is high volume telemetry with a low value per individual record. Searching can quickly lead to logs that provide a root cause explanation, but most data is repetitive and hard to contextualize when browsing. Patterns can make log data discoverable without spending a lot of time reading through low value data. one.newrelic.com > Logs > Patterns: Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or for configuring drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Technical overview Log patterns functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Log patterns use advanced clustering algorithms to group together similar log messages automatically. With patterns, you can: Orient more quickly through millions of logs. Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability The ability to configure this feature is dependent on role-based permissions. If you see Patterns are turned off in your Log management Patterns UI, click the Configure Patterns button and enable it. If you don't see patterns within 30 minutes of enabling the feature, there may be a lack of data with a message attribute for the system to create a pattern from. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Regional availability Availability for this feature depends on whether you have a US or EU region account: US region accounts can use log patterns. EU region accounts cannot enable log patterns at this time. Parsing limits We have a system of safety limits on memory and CPU resources when processing logs and their patterns. These parsing limits can have an impact on the data you get. For more information, see our documentation about parsing limits. Get started To start examining patterns: Go to one.newrelic.com > Log management, and use the account picker dropdown to select the target account where you want to explore patterns. In the left navigation of the Log management UI, click Patterns. The main log UI changes to show patterns that match the query in the query bar. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: The line chart shows the top 5 patterns over time. Use the time picker and query bar to adjust the results. Explore log patterns By default the log patterns UI first shows the most frequent occurrence of patterns. To sort to show the rarest patterns first, click the Count column. You can also use the query bar or attributes bar to filter your log patterns. If you want to... Do this... Understand the rate of change in patterns Look at the line chart. The color-coded patterns correspond to the plot column in the table. You can toggle individual plot patterns to narrow your focus. See the individual log messages that match each pattern Click pattern to expand the row and see a table of individual log records. To see additional records, scroll up or down. To explore an individual log in more detail, click it to open the details panel. Group and filter patterns by their attributes Use the query bar and time picker. As you apply different filters and time windows, the log patterns adjust to your new target data. Create an alert from a pattern Add the pattern to the query bar and run the query. Then click Create alert condition in the left nav. Troubleshoot log messages that haven't been clustered into a pattern Use the Logs with no pattern tab in the Log patterns UI. Clicking a specific log message will open the log message details panel you're familiar with from the Logs management page. Explore logs with no pattern The Logs with no pattern tab groups all recent log messages in your account that were not clustered into a known pattern yet. These log messages don't represent any problem or flaw in the system; they have no pattern because they are too new to have been processed by the machine learning system. This makes them valuable to explore when you want to understand what has recently changed in your environment. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: New Relic's log patterns feature automatically groups logs without a matching pattern. For example: Are any of these logs tied to a recent problem? This is a quick way to discover unique log data that is appearing for the first time in your environment. Does your log data have a new format? Sometimes the logs don't represent a problem, but a new format of log data that deviates from the data model you expect your applications to follow. Catching these logs early gives you the opportunity to ask developers to correct any deviations in their log output. The more consistent people are in the way log data is generated, the easier it becomes to use logs across a diverse set of teams. Masked attributes and wildcards Parts of the log messages in patterns are classified as variables and are substituted by masked attributes. The masking process supports and improves the clustering phase by allowing the algorithm to ignore changing details and focus on the repetitive structure. Masked attributes include: date_time ip url uuid Masked attributes are highlighted and are easy to identify, as shown in the following example. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of a pattern that has masked attributes. Log patterns extract other less trivial variables that don't belong to any masked attribute. These variables are indicated as wildcards *. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of how wildcards * group variables. Troubleshooting Here are a few reasons why you might have patterns enabled but not see any pattern data. If you're sure none of the items below are true, get help from support.newrelic.com. No data has arrived in the timeframe you're observing. Try expanding the time range you're viewing with the time picker. It's been less than 24 hours since patterns were enabled in the account. This means the ML model may not be generated for the account yet. None of the data coming in has a message field. Patterns will only be generated for values in the message field of a log record. If your logs don't contain message, there will be no data. Put the platform to work with patterns Patterns are a value that is enriched onto the existing log message as a new attribute named newrelic.logPattern. Anything you can do with logs generally can be done with log patterns, such as: Build your own dashboards with patterns, to monitor a specific pattern or group of patterns you care about. Create alerts for patterns by adding NRQL alerts. Use baseline alert conditions to detect anomalies in known log patterns.",

Recommendation: Change the drop rule's default name to a meaningful name. Choose to either drop the entire log event that matches the query or just a specific subset of attributes in the matching events. Review the log partitions where this drop rule applies. Save the drop filter rule. Types of drop filter rules The drop filters UI prompts you to select whether to drop logs based on the query or on specific attributes. Drop log events The default type of drop filter rule is to drop logs. This option drops the entire log events that match the filter or query. When creating a rule, try to provide a specific query that only matches log data that should be dropped. Our drop filters process won't let you create drop filter rules without values in the matching query. This prevents badly formed rules from dropping all log data. Drop attributes You can specify attributes to be dropped in a log event that matches your query. At least one or more attributes must be selected. Any attribute which is selected will be dropped; all remaining attributes will be kept and stored in NRDB. Tip We recommend this method for removing fields that could contain personal identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive attributes without losing valuable monitoring data. View or delete drop filter rules To view or delete a drop filter rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Drop filters. Click the delete icon next to the drop filter rule you want to remove. Once deleted, rules no longer filter ingested log events.",

      "body": "Use our Logs UI in New Relic One to quickly search through your log data in seconds. Each log lists available attributes in the log_summary column. To drill down into additional details, click any highlighted attribute. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Each log's summary provides query options to add, exclude, replace, and more. Query structure Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as new and relic, or phrases such as new relic agent, directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries. Tip Logs queries are based on the Lucene query language. For some helpful examples, check out this Lucene tutorial. General query rules: Log query rules Comments Case sensitive The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive. Exception: Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values. Special characters When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (\\). This includes special characters such as +, -, &, |, !, (, ), {, }, [, ], ^, \", ~, *, ?, :, /, or \\. Example: To query for \"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202, escape the quotes like this: \"\\\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\\\" 202\" Wildcard searches You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (*) to replace zero or more characters. Example: new*relic Search with text To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases. Text operators The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators: Condition Text operator example Matching (keyword) Search for log results containing keywords entered separately: \"new\" \"relic\" Exact matching (phrase) Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered: \"new relic agent\" Either / Or Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered: new OR relic And Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered: new AND relic * Wildcard (zero or more) Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them: new*relic Negation (keyword) Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered: -new Negation (phrase) Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered. -\"new relic\" Search with attributes Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field. General operators The following operators can be used by all types of attributes: Condition General operator example Equal : Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname equals chi: hostname:chi Does not equal - : Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname does not equal chi. -hostname:chi Contains * Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname contains chi. hostname:*chi* Does not contain - * Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname does not contain chi. -hostname:*chi* Starts with * Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname starts with chi. hostname:chi* Ends with * Search for log results where the attribute ends with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname ends with chi. hostname:*chi Has Search for log results that have the specified field. Example: Has the field user_name. has:user_name Missing Search for log results that are missing the specified field. Example: Missing the field user_name. missing:user_name Numeric operators The following operators can only be used by numeric attributes: Condition Numeric operator example Greater than Search for log results attribute matches that are greater than the given parameter. Example: The field http_response_time_ms is greater than 500. http_response_time_ms:>500 Greater than or equal to Search for log results with attribute matches that are greater than or equal to the given parameter. Example: The field http_response_time_ms is greater than or equal to 500. http_response_time_ms:>=500 Less than Search for log results with attribute matches that are less than the given parameter. Example: The field http_response_time_ms is less than 500. http_response_time_ms:<500 Less than or equal to Search for log results with attribute matches that are less than or equal to the given parameter.

Tip tvOS apps using Cocoapods have separate installation procedures. Installing your tvOS application As part of the installation process, New Relic Mobile automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic Mobile. For Admins with existing New Relic accounts, follow these steps to install and configure your application. (If you do not have a New Relic account, see New Relic Mobile.) Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. If applicable: From the Mobile Apps list, select Add a new app From the Get Started page, select tvOS as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Continue with the steps to configure New Relic Mobile. To complete the configuration process for a new mobile app later: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile, then select See Instructions next to your mobile app name. To upgrade an existing tvOS installation: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (selected app) > Settings > Installation. Configuring your tvOS application These procedures to configure your tvOS app also appear on the Get Started page in New Relic. Download and unzip the tvOS SDK for New Relic Mobile. To add the New Relic tvOS Mobile Framework to your Xcode project: Use Finder to drag the NewRelicAgentTVOS.framework folder into your Xcode project, and drop it onto your Project in the Project Navigator window. Follow the prompts to copy items into destination and to create folder references. Add the SystemConfiguration.framework, libc++.tbd, and libz.tbd libraries to your Linker settings. To start the agent: Import the New Relic Mobile Agent header at the top of your prefix.pch. Add + [ NewRelic startWithApplicationToken: < appToken>] to the top of -application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: in your AppDelegate.m using the unique application token that is automatically generated. Add a build script to your target's Build Phases and paste the following, replacing PUT_NEW_RELIC_APP_TOKEN_HERE with your application token: SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find \"${SRCROOT}\" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1` /bin/sh \"${SCRIPT}\" \"PUT_NEW_RELIC_APP_TOKEN_HERE\" Copy Clean and build your app, and then run it in the simulator or other device.

      "body": "Tip Owner or Admins Follow these instructions to install and configure New Relic Mobile functionality with your tvOS applications. Tip tvOS apps using Cocoapods have separate installation procedures. Installing your tvOS application As part of the installation process, New Relic Mobile automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic Mobile. For Admins with existing New Relic accounts, follow these steps to install and configure your application. (If you do not have a New Relic account, see New Relic Mobile.) Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. If applicable: From the Mobile Apps list, select Add a new app From the Get Started page, select tvOS as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Continue with the steps to configure New Relic Mobile. To complete the configuration process for a new mobile app later: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile, then select See Instructions next to your mobile app name. To upgrade an existing tvOS installation: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (selected app) > Settings > Installation. Configuring your tvOS application These procedures to configure your tvOS app also appear on the Get Started page in New Relic. Download and unzip the tvOS SDK for New Relic Mobile. To add the New Relic tvOS Mobile Framework to your Xcode project: Use Finder to drag the NewRelicAgentTVOS.framework folder into your Xcode project, and drop it onto your Project in the Project Navigator window. Follow the prompts to copy items into destination and to create folder references. Add the SystemConfiguration.framework, libc++.tbd, and libz.tbd libraries to your Linker settings. To start the agent: Import the New Relic Mobile Agent header at the top of your prefix.pch. Add + [ NewRelic startWithApplicationToken: < appToken>] to the top of -application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: in your AppDelegate.m using the unique application token that is automatically generated. Add a build script to your target's Build Phases and paste the following, replacing PUT_NEW_RELIC_APP_TOKEN_HERE with your application token: SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find \"${SRCROOT}\" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1` /bin/sh \"${SCRIPT}\" \"PUT_NEW_RELIC_APP_TOKEN_HERE\" Copy Clean and build your app, and then run it in the simulator or other device. Within a few minutes you will begin to see data for your iOS app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (selected app). If you don't, see No data appears. Executing a demo crash (optional) If you have trouble getting your app to crash, the New Relic agent provides an API to execute a demo crash. Recommendation: Add one of these lines of code to a button click event handler as applicable: [NewRelic crashNow]; Copy OR [NewRelic crashNow:@\"<reason>\"]; Copy Changing the logging level (optional) Six log levels are available for mobile apps monitoring: none error warning info verbose ALL To increase your logging level in the app, add this method call before calling startWithApplicationToken: [NRLogger setLogLevels:NRLogLevelALL]; Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Mobile Apps index (standard menu functions available from your list of mobile applications in New Relic Mobile) Mobile Apps Overview page (a summary of your mobile app's performance) Customizing your mobile app settings (Settings tab options to view your mobile app's application token, rename it, change its alert thresholds, or install New Relic Mobile updates) Upgrading New Relic Mobile for tvOS apps (standard upgrade procedures) No data appears (basic troubleshooting steps)",

This document introduces you to the REST API Explorer, which allows admin users and those with the API Key to: Browse the available REST API endpoints. Interact with the REST API within a user interface (the API Explorer). View a live source of documentation. Obtain curl commands for API actions. Share configured API calls with colleagues by copy and pasting API Explorer's URLs. This helps you to quickly search for solutions and test your API calls before adding them to your own software components. Features New Relic's API Explorer includes an interactive user interface for your selected account. The API Explorer UI lists the types of API calls (Applications, Users, etc.) and their available functions, such as GET metric data, PUT (update) applications, DELETE applications, etc. As you type values for Parameters, they automatically appear in the Request so that you can test and verify your syntax before sending the request. The UI indicates required fields, field descriptions, their type (integer, float, Boolean, etc.), and their location (path, query, etc.). For information on API keys, see REST API keys. rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore: The New Relic API Explorer makes it easy to test and send requests for any API endpoint. After you select your account and your choice of functions for the type of API call (applications, browsers, users, etc.), the UI provides an interactive form to view requirements and test your parameter values. Differences from API version 1 This API Explorer applies only to the New Relic REST API version 2, which focuses on data in and data out of New Relic. Version 2 replaces New Relic's deprecated REST API version 1. Be aware there are some differences between version 2 and 1: Names for data may be different.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to New Relic Full-Stack Observability Enterprise or New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and error_beacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. Currently Infinite Tracing is not FedRAMP compliant.",

This may lead to users deleting your app, which in turn may affect your organization's profitability. With New Relic Mobile's Handled exceptions user interface, mobile development managers and their developer teams can identify significant factors affecting poor mobile app experience, and use filterable data to find a resolution more quickly. Features Handling exceptions as they occur can help improve your mobile app users' experience, but it's not enough to catch exceptions. You also need to know how to prevent them. For example: How many different types of handled exceptions are occurring? A high occurrence rate may necessitate changes to the back-end systems. Why does the user's app usage result in a try/catch? What is the context for the exceptions? When can a test environment's responses to handled exceptions indicate additional, more serious problems? What would have caused a crash if the exception had not been caught in production? What else (in the code or back-end API) is still affecting the users' experience? By using handled exceptions with New Relic Mobile, you can identify and resolve these kinds of issues more quickly. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: As you explore the wealth of data in the charts and table, use groups and filters to discover patterns that help you determine the root cause of mobile app exceptions. Handled exception features Comments Slice and dice your exception data. New Relic Mobile offers both an API and a user interface to explore the data most important to your business. Use the recordHandledException() method within a try{...} catch(){...} block to help understand how often your application is throwing exceptions, and under what conditions. Use groups and filters to analyze trends leading to the exception. For example, you can group by OS Build, then filter a specific appVersion. Understand a particular user's experience. Examine the percentage charts to see overall trends with users and sessions at a glance. Then, use custom attributes to focus on exceptions related to paid accounts than free accounts. Pinpoint when most exceptions occur. For example, group on Last Interaction to get an overall view of problems. To drill down further, use filters, such as: To examine exceptions caused by network problems, filter by carrier and then select wifi. To examine exceptions caused by app releases, filter by appVersion. Align issues with common characteristics. For example: Use groups and filters to determine whether handled exception trends appear in networks (ASN, carrier, location, etc.) or in devices (device model, manufacturer, operating system build, version, etc.). Explore recurring patterns in stack traces with the top five exception locations table. Query data and share your findings via New Relic Insights. Explore the event trail before and after a crash. With New Relic Mobile you get a more complete picture of events before and after crashes occur, so you can analyze and resolve problems from multiple angles: Use the handled exception's Occurrences page for expected exceptions. Use the Crash analysis UI and event trail for unanticipated exceptions. Requirements Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level and mobile data retention. Additional requirements include: Android: New Relic Mobile's Android agent version 5.15.0 or higher iOS: New Relic Mobile's iOS agent version 5.15.0 or higher Handled exceptions API and event type New Relic Mobile automatically includes default attributes that you can use to explore your handled exceptions data in New Relic Insights and get specific details: Use the recordHandledExceptions() method for the Android or iOS SDK API. Query the MobileHandledException event type in Insights. For more information, see the Insights examples for New Relic Mobile. You can also create your own custom attributes and events. Then, select attributes in Mobile's Handled exceptions page, and query or share them in Insights.",

      "body": "With New Relic Mobile's Handled exceptions user interface, you can identify significant factors contributing to poor mobile application experience, and use filterable data to find a resolution more quickly. You can also use the handled exceptions API to customize the data you send to New Relic Mobile, and use New Relic Insights to query and share the data. Handled exceptions workflow To get the most out of New Relic Mobile's Handled exceptions UI, use this basic workflow: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions. Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information; for example, zoom into any area of a chart. Look for obvious or general trends in the Users affected and Sessions affected percentage charts. Adjust the types of exceptions shown by using groups and filters. Optional: Query or share the chart data via New Relic Insights. Look for similar patterns where exceptions appear in stack traces with the Top 5 exception locations table. To view stack trace thread details for each occurrence of the exception, select a record from the Top 5 exceptions location table. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: As you explore the wealth of data in the charts and table, use groups and filters to discover patterns that help you determine the root cause of mobile app exceptions. Exception percentage charts Start with the Users affected and Sessions affected percentage charts to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with exceptions in general. (If the Users affected chart is empty, there were no user sessions during the selected time period.) For example: Are there any spikes near a recent version release? Is there a time period when the percentage of users has been affected significantly by the exception? Are there uneventful periods? To examine data in greater detail: Below any chart, select Expand chart. Exception percentage charts example one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: The percentage charts help you quickly see any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with exceptions in general. Groups and filters Use the groups and filters to examine attributes for crashes, devices, locations, or other custom attributes in more detail. You can select a group, then filter to specific data. For example: Group the list by exception location (default), cause, app build or version, devices, connections, or other custom attributes. This lets you discover patterns in your exceptions to determine the root cause. Use the time picker to adjust the currently selected time period. Filter by a specific Version or by one or more attribute Filter, such as appVersion, exceptionLocationMethod, lastInteraction, or any of the longer list of standard and custom attributes. The currently selected filters appear at the top of the UI page. You can close them, add other filters, or select other groups and filters. Groups and filters example one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: Group the data by attributes that matter to the most to you, then select one or more filters to help pinpoint specific causes behind the exceptions. Top five exception locations Use the Top 5 exception locations table to find or sort patterns in the type of exception you selected from the groups and filters. This includes: Recurring locations in the stack trace Mobile app version Number of occurrences Number of users affected during the selected time period For example, you can group by Exception Message, filter to timeout message, then select individual timeout locations from the table to review the stack trace thread and details about each occurrence. To filter or group by other attributes, use the table's search window, or select any of the available filters. For example, filter by type of occurrence, device, a specific location, or any custom attributes. To look for other historical patterns, change the selected time period. Top five exception locations example one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: This example shows the Expand chart button and links to New Relic Insights, where you can query, create dashboards, and share the handled exceptions data. Insights links New Relic Mobile's Handled exceptions charts use New Relic Insights default attributes for mobile events (including MobileHandledException), along with any custom attributes you have added to this event type. When you mouse over the charts, direct links appear below them. These links to New Relic Insights allow you to analyze your mobile app data even deeper. View query link: View the Insights NRQL query used to calculate the chart data. View in Insights link: View the chart in Insights, and share it with others. Exception locations table The Exception locations table supplements the charts. It lists where the top five handled exceptions appear in their stack trace thread, and links them to relevant details. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this exception occurred within the selected time period? Does a specific app version have a higher (or lower) number of users affected? Which exception has the fewest number of occurrences? You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of exceptions that matter the most to you and your teams. To view additional thread details for each occurrence of the exception, select a record from the Top 5 exceptions location table. Exception locations table example one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: To continue to the handled exception's Occurrences page, select any row on the table.",

With New Relic Mobile's Handled exceptions user interface, mobile development managers and their developer teams can identify significant factors affecting poor mobile app experience, and use filterable data to find a resolution more quickly. Features Handling exceptions as they occur can help improve your mobile app users' experience, but it's not enough to catch exceptions. You also need to know how to prevent them. For example: How many different types of handled exceptions are occurring? A high occurrence rate may necessitate changes to the back-end systems. Why does the user's app usage result in a try/catch? What is the context for the exceptions? When can a test environment's responses to handled exceptions indicate additional, more serious problems?

These can be events New Relic monitors by default, or custom events you created in New Relic Insights. This document explains what the crash event trail is and how to use it. Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level. View events before mobile app crashes When a mobile app crashes and you don't know why, you can study what happened right before the crash. New Relic Mobile's crash event trail shows you these events so that you can follow the \"breadcrumbs\" leading up to the crash and diagnose the cause of the failure. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select a mobile app) > Crash analysis > (selected crash type) > Event trail: The crash event trail shows the activity leading up to a mobile app crash. The crash event trail shows all New Relic Mobile event types leading up to a crash. You can use New Relic Mobile's iOS SDK or Android SDK to create custom MobileBreadcrumb events that track whatever app activity you think would help you diagnose a crash. You can also use MobileHandledException events in the crash event trail to aid in debugging. Use the iOS and Android recordHandledException APIs for iOS or Android to annotate where exceptions are handled in your application. These events will automatically appear in the crash event trail. For more about annotating crash event trails with custom data, see Add custom data to New Relic Mobile. Use the event trail To use the New Relic Mobile crash event trail: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select a mobile app) > Crash analysis. On the lower right side of the Crash analysis page, select a crash type. On the Crash details page, beside the stack trace, select Event trail. Study the events leading up to a crash type for clues to the reasons for the crash. To expand details about an event's attributes, select it. To view the event trail results in New Relic Insights, select Open session in Insights. To scroll through occurrences of the same crash type, use the event trail's left and right arrows. For optimal use of New Relic's crash analysis tools, use: New Relic Mobile's Android SDK API or iOS SDK API to create custom MobileBreadcrumb or MobileHandledException events Enable MobileRequest events New Relic Mobile's Crash analysis page New Relic Mobile's Interaction trail New Relic Insights queries of your crash event data New Relic Insights dashboards Difference between event trail and interaction trail The crash event trail is different from the interaction trail. The crash event trail shows all New Relic Mobile event types leading up to a crash, whereas the interaction trail only shows interaction event types (Mobile events with the category interaction). The interaction trail has additional features, including stack traces and links to the associated interaction charts.",

Groups and filters Use the groups and filters to examine attributes for crashes, devices, locations, or other custom attributes in more detail. You can select a group, then filter to specific data. For example: Group the list by exception location (default), cause, app build or version, devices, connections, or other custom attributes. This lets you discover patterns in your exceptions to determine the root cause. Use the time picker to adjust the currently selected time period. Filter by a specific Version or by one or more attribute Filter, such as appVersion, exceptionLocationMethod, lastInteraction, or any of the longer list of standard and custom attributes. The currently selected filters appear at the top of the UI page. You can close them, add other filters, or select other groups and filters. Groups and filters example one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: Group the data by attributes that matter to the most to you, then select one or more filters to help pinpoint specific causes behind the exceptions. Top five exception locations Use the Top 5 exception locations table to find or sort patterns in the type of exception you selected from the groups and filters. This includes: Recurring locations in the stack trace Mobile app version Number of occurrences Number of users affected during the selected time period For example, you can group by Exception Message, filter to timeout message, then select individual timeout locations from the table to review the stack trace thread and details about each occurrence. To filter or group by other attributes, use the table's search window, or select any of the available filters. For example, filter by type of occurrence, device, a specific location, or any custom attributes. To look for other historical patterns, change the selected time period. Top five exception locations example one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: This example shows the Expand chart button and links to New Relic Insights, where you can query, create dashboards, and share the handled exceptions data. Insights links New Relic Mobile's Handled exceptions charts use New Relic Insights default attributes for mobile events (including MobileHandledException), along with any custom attributes you have added to this event type. When you mouse over the charts, direct links appear below them. These links to New Relic Insights allow you to analyze your mobile app data even deeper. View query link: View the Insights NRQL query used to calculate the chart data. View in Insights link: View the chart in Insights, and share it with others. Exception locations table The Exception locations table supplements the charts. It lists where the top five handled exceptions appear in their stack trace thread, and links them to relevant details. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this exception occurred within the selected time period? Does a specific app version have a higher (or lower) number of users affected? Which exception has the fewest number of occurrences? You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of exceptions that matter the most to you and your teams. To view additional thread details for each occurrence of the exception, select a record from the Top 5 exceptions location table. Exception locations table example one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: To continue to the handled exception's Occurrences page, select any row on the table.",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring provides an engine that instruments your application code for Android and iOS apps and monitors your code as it services your user interactions. This is useful for analyzing time-consuming user activities. After you set up the SDK API for your Android or iOS app, you can view detailed information from New Relic Mobile's Interactions page. Instrumentation We offer SDK APIs to instrument interactions for Android and iOS apps. This includes: Android: Activities, AsyncTask threading, and the performance of database, image loading, JSON parsing, and other common APIs iOS: UIViewControllers, GCD dispatch_async, and the performance of CoreData, UIImage, NSJSON, and other common APIs For more information, see Working with the Android SDK API and Working with the iOS SDK API. Viewing the Interactions page The Interactions page includes breakdown charts of the five most expensive interactions (including code executing on the main thread and code executing on worker threads), plus a list of the slowest traces. To view the Interactions page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > App > Interactions. To drill down into detailed information, select any interaction, or use any of our standard user interface functions and page functions. Tip To go directly to Interactions from the Mobile Apps Overview page, select the Slowest interactions chart's title, or select any interaction to view detailed information. Viewing breakdown table details To show the full list of all instrumented methods: From the selected interaction, select the Breakdown table link. If you use custom instrumentation for any of the metrics, the category for the class and method name will indicate custom. For each traced method, the Interactions breakdown table shows: Thread type (foreground or background) Class and method name Percentage of total execution time spent in this method Average number of calls to this method per interaction Overall average execution time of each call to this method Viewing the Interactions timeline Each interaction trace period records traces until a new interaction begins. To view the Interactions timeline for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > App > Interactions. From the Slowest traces table, select the Activity or Duration link for the trace. OR: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > App > Interactions > (select an interaction). From the Slowest traces table, select the Duration link for the trace. As you mouse over the timeline, information appears for the method underneath, memory used by your application, and any active network requests. The row labels indicate which thread each method is running on. To view a waterfall of execution flow within a method, select a method block. The Interactions timeline also provides on-device metrics to help you gain insight into your app's device level data. The usage metrics show how your app is interacting with your end users's devices.

This is useful for analyzing time-consuming user activities. After you set up the SDK API for your Android or iOS app, you can view detailed information from New Relic Mobile's Interactions page. Instrumentation We offer SDK APIs to instrument interactions for Android and iOS apps. This includes: Android: Activities, AsyncTask threading, and the performance of database, image loading, JSON parsing, and other common APIs iOS: UIViewControllers, GCD dispatch_async, and the performance of CoreData, UIImage, NSJSON, and other common APIs For more information, see Working with the Android SDK API and Working with the iOS SDK API.

Viewing breakdown table details To show the full list of all instrumented methods: From the selected interaction, select the Breakdown table link. If you use custom instrumentation for any of the metrics, the category for the class and method name will indicate custom. For each traced method, the Interactions breakdown table shows: Thread type (foreground or background) Class and method name Percentage of total execution time spent in this method Average number of calls to this method per interaction Overall average execution time of each call to this method Viewing the Interactions timeline Each interaction trace period records traces until a new interaction begins. To view the Interactions timeline for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > App > Interactions. From the Slowest traces table, select the Activity or Duration link for the trace. OR: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > App > Interactions > (select an interaction). From the Slowest traces table, select the Duration link for the trace. As you mouse over the timeline, information appears for the method underneath, memory used by your application, and any active network requests. The row labels indicate which thread each method is running on. To view a waterfall of execution flow within a method, select a method block.

      "body": "Mobile monitoring provides an engine that instruments your application code for Android and iOS apps and monitors your code as it services your user interactions. This is useful for analyzing time-consuming user activities. After you set up the SDK API for your Android or iOS app, you can view detailed information from New Relic Mobile's Interactions page. Instrumentation We offer SDK APIs to instrument interactions for Android and iOS apps. This includes: Android: Activities, AsyncTask threading, and the performance of database, image loading, JSON parsing, and other common APIs iOS: UIViewControllers, GCD dispatch_async, and the performance of CoreData, UIImage, NSJSON, and other common APIs For more information, see Working with the Android SDK API and Working with the iOS SDK API. Viewing the Interactions page The Interactions page includes breakdown charts of the five most expensive interactions (including code executing on the main thread and code executing on worker threads), plus a list of the slowest traces. To view the Interactions page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > App > Interactions. To drill down into detailed information, select any interaction, or use any of our standard user interface functions and page functions. Tip To go directly to Interactions from the Mobile Apps Overview page, select the Slowest interactions chart's title, or select any interaction to view detailed information. Viewing breakdown table details To show the full list of all instrumented methods: From the selected interaction, select the Breakdown table link. If you use custom instrumentation for any of the metrics, the category for the class and method name will indicate custom. For each traced method, the Interactions breakdown table shows: Thread type (foreground or background) Class and method name Percentage of total execution time spent in this method Average number of calls to this method per interaction Overall average execution time of each call to this method Viewing the Interactions timeline Each interaction trace period records traces until a new interaction begins. To view the Interactions timeline for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > App > Interactions. From the Slowest traces table, select the Activity or Duration link for the trace. OR: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > App > Interactions > (select an interaction). From the Slowest traces table, select the Duration link for the trace. As you mouse over the timeline, information appears for the method underneath, memory used by your application, and any active network requests. The row labels indicate which thread each method is running on. To view a waterfall of execution flow within a method, select a method block. The Interactions timeline also provides on-device metrics to help you gain insight into your app's device level data. The usage metrics show how your app is interacting with your end users's devices. In addition to operating system metrics, the usage metrics include database, CPU, and memory. To view the on-device usage metrics, mouse over the timeline. To drill down into detailed information, select any location on the timeline. To help provide context for the data, select the Previous interaction link.

QA engineer Make sure that a new version of your app does not cause a spike in errors compared to a previous version. DevOps engineer See a list of domains and URLs associated with HTTP errors and network failures, so you can focus on the ones that are causing errors and filter out status codes that are too noisy for your alerts. Mobile developer Find out if there are frontend or backend problems affecting your mobile app (even without an error alert going off) so that you can address them in a new version. Support engineer View the errors and session attributes (geography, connection type, device, app version) associated with an error so that you can help customers with their issues. Find and use the HTTP errors page There are two ways to get to the HTTP errors page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > Network errors. From a mobile app's Overview page in Mobile monitoring, select the HTTP errors/network failures chart title link. From the HTTP errors page, investigate HTTP request and network failures: Use any standard page functions to look for trends in Errors and failures charts. Target specific types of errors and failures by grouping, sorting, and filtering the data. Find anomalies in your request errors with HTTP error profiles. Select an error or failure to view details for it. You can also define NRQL alerts that are focused on error types for your critical services or query your app data. Group, sort, and filter errors and failures If you want to do this... Do this... Change how the page groups and sorts errors and network failures Make selections from the Group by and Sort by dropdowns. By default, the Network errors page is grouped by request domain and sorted by errors and failures. Filter for specific errors and network failures Select an error or failure from the Errors and failures list and/or select multiple filters from the Filter dropdown. See which filters you applied or remove filters The filters you select display next to the filter dropdown. To clear filters, select the X next to the filter you want to clear. Change the time window Select a new time period from the Time picker dropdown. View information for one specific app version Select the version that you want to see charts and lists for in the Versions dropdown. HTTP error profiles Error profiles provide visual details about significant differences in the frequency of different values for HTTP error events. For each attribute, the error profile includes: A pie chart showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most A table comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of other errors This helps you take more of the guesswork out of resolving your mobile application's HTTP errors. You can more easily determine if you safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code change, customer communication or other actions. View more details about a specific error To view details about an error or failure, select the Request URL link to be directed to the Error summary page. From the Error summary page, you can view the version information, request attributes, and Response body, as well as get a breakdown of error types for the request URL. View and share error data in Insights To view any of the charts or lists on the HTTP errors/requests page in Insights: Select for any chart. Select View query and then View in Insights. From Insights, you can add the error data to a dashboard and share it via a permalink. To dig deeper into the error data, query your data for the following events and attributes: MobileRequestError events and attributes MobileRequest events and attributes View legacy HTTP errors UI page Accounts that do not have an Enterprise-level subscription see a different HTTP Errors UI page: The Errors page includes details about HTTP errors (403, 404, 422, 500, 502, etc.) and network failures for your hosts; for example: Secure connection failed Timed out Cannot find host Not connected to Internet Cannot connect to host View the Errors page To view HTTP errors or network failures for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > Errors. To change the view to errors or failures, select the Sort by option. To hide low-usage hosts, select the Hide < 1% throughput option. To limit information to a specific version of your app, or to change the time period, select your choice from the Versions menu or the time picker below the menu bar. To view details for a specific host, HTTP status error, or network failure, select its name. Use any of our standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. Error trace details Mobile monitoring will capture the response details from HTTP requests that return a 400 or 500 level status code. In addition, error messages generated from Android apps will include a stack trace. To view details about an error trace on the Errors page, select its request URL link. From here you can: View the response body. Share the error details with others by email. File a ticket about it through a ticketing system integrated with New Relic. Delete or hide the error. The errors chart also appears on the selected mobile app's Overview page. If the chart shows errors, you can select its HTTP errors/network failures title or select anywhere on the Overview page's chart to go directly to this Errors page. View error data in Insights To dig deeper into your request data, use New Relic Insights to query and chart the MobileRequest events and attributes. Unknown errors or URL errors The Mobile agents maintain a list of exception types. In some cases, custom exceptions thrown by applications fall outside of this list. When this happens, Unknown may appear in the Mobile Errors page. If you find Unknown in your list of errors and need assistance in researching which exception types are being missed, get support at support.newrelic.com.",

If the chart shows errors, you can select its HTTP errors/network failures title or select anywhere on the Overview page's chart to go directly to this Errors page. View error data in Insights To dig deeper into your request data, use New Relic Insights to query and chart the MobileRequest events and attributes. Unknown errors or URL errors The Mobile agents maintain a list of exception types. In some cases, custom exceptions thrown by applications fall outside of this list. When this happens, Unknown may appear in the Mobile Errors page. If you find Unknown in your list of errors and need assistance in researching which exception types are being missed, get support at support.newrelic.com.",

      "body": "Important The mobile Maps UI will be deprecated on December 22, 2020. Service maps are available in New Relic One's left navigation for each mobile entity, and they are a better way to visualize and customize representations of your architecture. For more information, see our Explorers Hub post. Maps help you find performance problems for a mobile app or its services. This gives you a clear picture of your app's relationships to other services and the influence of each service on the others. If one service fails, you can see at a glance which other services are affected. View a map of your mobile app services To view your mobile app and its related services as an architectural map, go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select a mobile app) > Monitor > Service map. For more information, see the service maps documentation. If you need to use the deprecated mobile Map page, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > Map. To view HTTP request details for a service, select its name. To view details for an app monitored by APM that is related to the service, select the service's name below the associated hostname. To view throughput details as a chart, select the icon or the cpm bar below the service's name. To view detailed metrics for a service, mouse over the throughput chart.
