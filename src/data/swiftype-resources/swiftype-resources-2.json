From the account dropdown in the New Relic UI, select Account settings. In the right sidebar under Most recent, select the Java agent, and save the newrelic-java.zip to a temporary directory. Unzip newrelic-java.zip. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report on any data in your New Relic Account. To copy your license key: Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings. Under Account information, copy the license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

      "body": "APM for Java allows you to use an Ansible role for installation and configuration. Compatibility and requirements New Relic's Ansible role for the Java agent is open source and community-supported. It supports setting up our Java agent to instrument applications running under Tomcat, Jetty, and Wildfly (formerly JBoss) on Linux servers. The most common agent parameters can be configured through Ansible variables. You'll need to install Ansible to run this role. Ansible is run from a central server to configure target hosts; these hosts must be running Linux and have unzip installed. The role should be compatible with most popular Linux distributions. Overview of process There are several steps that may be involved for installation and configuration: Install the role Incorporate role in your playbook Configure the role Configure the agent Enable custom instrumentation (optional) Step 1. Install the role To install this role, use the ansible-galaxy command on the system where you run Ansible: $ ansible-galaxy install newrelic.newrelic_java_agent Copy This will download the role from Ansible Galaxy and make it available for use in Ansible playbooks. Step 2. Incorporate the role into playbook You'll need to call the role from your playbook using the include_role module. The role's GitHub repository contains an example playbook for you to start from, which looks like this: - hosts: YOUR_HOST_GROUP vars: nr_java_agent_config: license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY app_name: YOUR_APP_NAME log_file_path: /tmp/newrelic server_type: tomcat server_root: /var/lib/tomcat8 jvm_conf_file: /usr/share/tomcat8/bin/setenv.sh server_user: tomcat8 server_group: tomcat8 service_name: tomcat8 restart_web_server: true tasks: - include_role: name: newrelic.newrelic_java_agent Copy The vars section contains a dictionary called nr_java_agent_config, which holds settings for the agent itself, and a number of variables for configuring the role's installation process. See the sections on agent configuration and role configuration for details. Step 3. Configure the role These variables are used to configure the install process. Most are required. For more information, see the examples on GitHub. Variable Description server_type Required. Web server used by your application. Possible values are: tomcat, jetty, and wildfly (standalone mode only). server_root Required. Location of the web server on the host. The agent's JAR, configuration, and (by default) log files will live in a subdirectory of this directory. jvm_conf_file Required. Path to the web server configuration file to reference the New Relic Java agent. For Tomcat, for instance, it's typically the setenv.sh file. If the file doesn't exist, it may be created, depending on the server_type. server_user server_group Required. User and group under which the web server runs. Used to set the ownership of the newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml files. restart_web_server Optional. Default: true. If set to false, the role does not restart the web server after installing the agent. Note that the agent is not activated until the web server is restarted. service_name Required (unless restart_web_server is set to false). Service name under which the web server runs. Used by Ansible to restart the web server after the agent is installed. nr_java_agent_version Optional; default: currentSpecifies the version of the Java agent to install. current will install the latest version. You can also install a specific version, like 5.9.0. For available versions, see Java agent downloads directory. Step 4. Configure the agent The following variables are used to configure the Java agent itself. These are just a few of the available options. For a full list of supported variables, see the README file on GitHub. For more about how to configure the agent, see Java agent configuration. Variable Description license_key Required. Your New Relic license key. app_name Required. Name of the application being instrumented. For more details, see App naming. proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_password proxy_scheme Optional. If you connect to the New Relic collector via a proxy, you can configure your proxy settings with these values. labels Optional. User-configurable custom labels for the agent. Labels are name-value pairs. Names and values are limited to 255 characters and cannot contain colons (:) nor semicolons (;). Value should be a semicolon-separated list of key-value pairs, for example Server:One;Data Center:Primary. Step 5. Enable custom instrumentation (optional) If you want to enable custom instrumentation, you can provide a list of XML files using the custom_instrumentation_files variable. For instance, you can specify that all Java agents being installed should use a file called my_instrumentation.xml by adding something like the following to your playbook: vars: custom_instrumentation_files: - /path/to/my_instrumentation.xml Copy See the README and examples on GitHub for more information.

Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

      "body": "APM for Java allows you to use an Ansible role for installation and configuration. Compatibility and requirements New Relic's Ansible role for the Java agent is open source and community-supported. It supports setting up our Java agent to instrument applications running under Tomcat, Jetty, and Wildfly (formerly JBoss) on Linux servers. The most common agent parameters can be configured through Ansible variables. You'll need to install Ansible to run this role. Ansible is run from a central server to configure target hosts; these hosts must be running Linux and have unzip installed. The role should be compatible with most popular Linux distributions. Overview of process There are several steps that may be involved for installation and configuration: Install the role Incorporate role in your playbook Configure the role Configure the agent Enable custom instrumentation (optional) Step 1. Install the role To install this role, use the ansible-galaxy command on the system where you run Ansible: $ ansible-galaxy install newrelic.newrelic_java_agent Copy This will download the role from Ansible Galaxy and make it available for use in Ansible playbooks. Step 2. Incorporate the role into playbook You'll need to call the role from your playbook using the include_role module. The role's GitHub repository contains an example playbook for you to start from, which looks like this: - hosts: YOUR_HOST_GROUP vars: nr_java_agent_config: license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY app_name: YOUR_APP_NAME log_file_path: /tmp/newrelic server_type: tomcat server_root: /var/lib/tomcat8 jvm_conf_file: /usr/share/tomcat8/bin/setenv.sh server_user: tomcat8 server_group: tomcat8 service_name: tomcat8 restart_web_server: true tasks: - include_role: name: newrelic.newrelic_java_agent Copy The vars section contains a dictionary called nr_java_agent_config, which holds settings for the agent itself, and a number of variables for configuring the role's installation process. See the sections on agent configuration and role configuration for details. Step 3. Configure the role These variables are used to configure the install process. Most are required. For more information, see the examples on GitHub. Variable Description server_type Required. Web server used by your application. Possible values are: tomcat, jetty, and wildfly (standalone mode only). server_root Required. Location of the web server on the host. The agent's JAR, configuration, and (by default) log files will live in a subdirectory of this directory. jvm_conf_file Required. Path to the web server configuration file to reference the New Relic Java agent. For Tomcat, for instance, it's typically the setenv.sh file. If the file doesn't exist, it may be created, depending on the server_type. server_user server_group Required. User and group under which the web server runs. Used to set the ownership of the newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml files. restart_web_server Optional. Default: true. If set to false, the role does not restart the web server after installing the agent. Note that the agent is not activated until the web server is restarted. service_name Required (unless restart_web_server is set to false). Service name under which the web server runs. Used by Ansible to restart the web server after the agent is installed. nr_java_agent_version Optional; default: currentSpecifies the version of the Java agent to install. current will install the latest version. You can also install a specific version, like 5.9.0. For available versions, see Java agent downloads directory. Step 4. Configure the agent The following variables are used to configure the Java agent itself. These are just a few of the available options. For a full list of supported variables, see the README file on GitHub. For more about how to configure the agent, see Java agent configuration. Variable Description license_key Required. Your New Relic license key. app_name Required. Name of the application being instrumented. For more details, see App naming. proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_password proxy_scheme Optional. If you connect to the New Relic collector via a proxy, you can configure your proxy settings with these values. labels Optional. User-configurable custom labels for the agent. Labels are name-value pairs. Names and values are limited to 255 characters and cannot contain colons (:) nor semicolons (;). Value should be a semicolon-separated list of key-value pairs, for example Server:One;Data Center:Primary. Step 5. Enable custom instrumentation (optional) If you want to enable custom instrumentation, you can provide a list of XML files using the custom_instrumentation_files variable. For instance, you can specify that all Java agents being installed should use a file called my_instrumentation.xml by adding something like the following to your playbook: vars: custom_instrumentation_files: - /path/to/my_instrumentation.xml Copy See the README and examples on GitHub for more information.

We discuss required configurations and also explore some optional configurations, including: How to use identical New Relic configuration files for each container, regardless of the environment where the containers are used How to use the Docker layer when every agent in every environment needs slightly different configuration data How to disable the New Relic agent in some environments and enable it in others Although we don't discuss advanced options here, you can install the Java agent in Docker volumes and use your Docker container image in other software such as Swarm, ECS, AKS, EKS, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. Our Docker examples refer to Tomcat, so if you are using another application server, refer to your vendor’s documentation. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Get the Java agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this PowerShell command: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip -OutFile newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip: Expand-Archive -Path newrelic-java.zip -DestinationPath DESTINATION_PATH Copy Download from the New Relic UI Complete the following: Log in to New Relic. From the account dropdown in the New Relic UI, select Account settings. In the right sidebar under Most recent, select the Java agent, and save the newrelic-java.zip to a temporary directory. Unzip newrelic-java.zip. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report on any data in your New Relic Account. To copy your license key: Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings. Under Account information, copy the license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count.

      "body": "APM for Java allows you to use an Ansible role for installation and configuration. Compatibility and requirements New Relic's Ansible role for the Java agent is open source and community-supported. It supports setting up our Java agent to instrument applications running under Tomcat, Jetty, and Wildfly (formerly JBoss) on Linux servers. The most common agent parameters can be configured through Ansible variables. You'll need to install Ansible to run this role. Ansible is run from a central server to configure target hosts; these hosts must be running Linux and have unzip installed. The role should be compatible with most popular Linux distributions. Overview of process There are several steps that may be involved for installation and configuration: Install the role Incorporate role in your playbook Configure the role Configure the agent Enable custom instrumentation (optional) Step 1. Install the role To install this role, use the ansible-galaxy command on the system where you run Ansible: $ ansible-galaxy install newrelic.newrelic_java_agent Copy This will download the role from Ansible Galaxy and make it available for use in Ansible playbooks. Step 2. Incorporate the role into playbook You'll need to call the role from your playbook using the include_role module. The role's GitHub repository contains an example playbook for you to start from, which looks like this: - hosts: YOUR_HOST_GROUP vars: nr_java_agent_config: license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY app_name: YOUR_APP_NAME log_file_path: /tmp/newrelic server_type: tomcat server_root: /var/lib/tomcat8 jvm_conf_file: /usr/share/tomcat8/bin/setenv.sh server_user: tomcat8 server_group: tomcat8 service_name: tomcat8 restart_web_server: true tasks: - include_role: name: newrelic.newrelic_java_agent Copy The vars section contains a dictionary called nr_java_agent_config, which holds settings for the agent itself, and a number of variables for configuring the role's installation process. See the sections on agent configuration and role configuration for details. Step 3. Configure the role These variables are used to configure the install process. Most are required. For more information, see the examples on GitHub. Variable Description server_type Required. Web server used by your application. Possible values are: tomcat, jetty, and wildfly (standalone mode only). server_root Required. Location of the web server on the host. The agent's JAR, configuration, and (by default) log files will live in a subdirectory of this directory. jvm_conf_file Required. Path to the web server configuration file to reference the New Relic Java agent. For Tomcat, for instance, it's typically the setenv.sh file. If the file doesn't exist, it may be created, depending on the server_type. server_user server_group Required. User and group under which the web server runs. Used to set the ownership of the newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml files. restart_web_server Optional. Default: true. If set to false, the role does not restart the web server after installing the agent. Note that the agent is not activated until the web server is restarted. service_name Required (unless restart_web_server is set to false). Service name under which the web server runs. Used by Ansible to restart the web server after the agent is installed. nr_java_agent_version Optional; default: currentSpecifies the version of the Java agent to install. current will install the latest version. You can also install a specific version, like 5.9.0. For available versions, see Java agent downloads directory. Step 4. Configure the agent The following variables are used to configure the Java agent itself. These are just a few of the available options. For a full list of supported variables, see the README file on GitHub. For more about how to configure the agent, see Java agent configuration. Variable Description license_key Required. Your New Relic license key. app_name Required. Name of the application being instrumented. For more details, see App naming. proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_password proxy_scheme Optional. If you connect to the New Relic collector via a proxy, you can configure your proxy settings with these values. labels Optional. User-configurable custom labels for the agent. Labels are name-value pairs. Names and values are limited to 255 characters and cannot contain colons (:) nor semicolons (;). Value should be a semicolon-separated list of key-value pairs, for example Server:One;Data Center:Primary. Step 5. Enable custom instrumentation (optional) If you want to enable custom instrumentation, you can provide a list of XML files using the custom_instrumentation_files variable. For instance, you can specify that all Java agents being installed should use a file called my_instrumentation.xml by adding something like the following to your playbook: vars: custom_instrumentation_files: - /path/to/my_instrumentation.xml Copy See the README and examples on GitHub for more information.

From the account dropdown in the New Relic UI, select Account settings. In the right sidebar under Most recent, select the Java agent, and save the newrelic-java.zip to a temporary directory. Unzip newrelic-java.zip. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report on any data in your New Relic Account. To copy your license key: Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings. Under Account information, copy the license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

      "body": "APM for Java allows you to use an Ansible role for installation and configuration. Compatibility and requirements New Relic's Ansible role for the Java agent is open source and community-supported. It supports setting up our Java agent to instrument applications running under Tomcat, Jetty, and Wildfly (formerly JBoss) on Linux servers. The most common agent parameters can be configured through Ansible variables. You'll need to install Ansible to run this role. Ansible is run from a central server to configure target hosts; these hosts must be running Linux and have unzip installed. The role should be compatible with most popular Linux distributions. Overview of process There are several steps that may be involved for installation and configuration: Install the role Incorporate role in your playbook Configure the role Configure the agent Enable custom instrumentation (optional) Step 1. Install the role To install this role, use the ansible-galaxy command on the system where you run Ansible: $ ansible-galaxy install newrelic.newrelic_java_agent Copy This will download the role from Ansible Galaxy and make it available for use in Ansible playbooks. Step 2. Incorporate the role into playbook You'll need to call the role from your playbook using the include_role module. The role's GitHub repository contains an example playbook for you to start from, which looks like this: - hosts: YOUR_HOST_GROUP vars: nr_java_agent_config: license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY app_name: YOUR_APP_NAME log_file_path: /tmp/newrelic server_type: tomcat server_root: /var/lib/tomcat8 jvm_conf_file: /usr/share/tomcat8/bin/setenv.sh server_user: tomcat8 server_group: tomcat8 service_name: tomcat8 restart_web_server: true tasks: - include_role: name: newrelic.newrelic_java_agent Copy The vars section contains a dictionary called nr_java_agent_config, which holds settings for the agent itself, and a number of variables for configuring the role's installation process. See the sections on agent configuration and role configuration for details. Step 3. Configure the role These variables are used to configure the install process. Most are required. For more information, see the examples on GitHub. Variable Description server_type Required. Web server used by your application. Possible values are: tomcat, jetty, and wildfly (standalone mode only). server_root Required. Location of the web server on the host. The agent's JAR, configuration, and (by default) log files will live in a subdirectory of this directory. jvm_conf_file Required. Path to the web server configuration file to reference the New Relic Java agent. For Tomcat, for instance, it's typically the setenv.sh file. If the file doesn't exist, it may be created, depending on the server_type. server_user server_group Required. User and group under which the web server runs. Used to set the ownership of the newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml files. restart_web_server Optional. Default: true. If set to false, the role does not restart the web server after installing the agent. Note that the agent is not activated until the web server is restarted. service_name Required (unless restart_web_server is set to false). Service name under which the web server runs. Used by Ansible to restart the web server after the agent is installed. nr_java_agent_version Optional; default: currentSpecifies the version of the Java agent to install. current will install the latest version. You can also install a specific version, like 5.9.0. For available versions, see Java agent downloads directory. Step 4. Configure the agent The following variables are used to configure the Java agent itself. These are just a few of the available options. For a full list of supported variables, see the README file on GitHub. For more about how to configure the agent, see Java agent configuration. Variable Description license_key Required. Your New Relic license key. app_name Required. Name of the application being instrumented. For more details, see App naming. proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_password proxy_scheme Optional. If you connect to the New Relic collector via a proxy, you can configure your proxy settings with these values. labels Optional. User-configurable custom labels for the agent. Labels are name-value pairs. Names and values are limited to 255 characters and cannot contain colons (:) nor semicolons (;). Value should be a semicolon-separated list of key-value pairs, for example Server:One;Data Center:Primary. Step 5. Enable custom instrumentation (optional) If you want to enable custom instrumentation, you can provide a list of XML files using the custom_instrumentation_files variable. For instance, you can specify that all Java agents being installed should use a file called my_instrumentation.xml by adding something like the following to your playbook: vars: custom_instrumentation_files: - /path/to/my_instrumentation.xml Copy See the README and examples on GitHub for more information.

      "body": "APM for Java allows you to use an Ansible role for installation and configuration. Compatibility and requirements New Relic's Ansible role for the Java agent is open source and community-supported. It supports setting up our Java agent to instrument applications running under Tomcat, Jetty, and Wildfly (formerly JBoss) on Linux servers. The most common agent parameters can be configured through Ansible variables. You'll need to install Ansible to run this role. Ansible is run from a central server to configure target hosts; these hosts must be running Linux and have unzip installed. The role should be compatible with most popular Linux distributions. Overview of process There are several steps that may be involved for installation and configuration: Install the role Incorporate role in your playbook Configure the role Configure the agent Enable custom instrumentation (optional) Step 1. Install the role To install this role, use the ansible-galaxy command on the system where you run Ansible: $ ansible-galaxy install newrelic.newrelic_java_agent Copy This will download the role from Ansible Galaxy and make it available for use in Ansible playbooks. Step 2. Incorporate the role into playbook You'll need to call the role from your playbook using the include_role module. The role's GitHub repository contains an example playbook for you to start from, which looks like this: - hosts: YOUR_HOST_GROUP vars: nr_java_agent_config: license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY app_name: YOUR_APP_NAME log_file_path: /tmp/newrelic server_type: tomcat server_root: /var/lib/tomcat8 jvm_conf_file: /usr/share/tomcat8/bin/setenv.sh server_user: tomcat8 server_group: tomcat8 service_name: tomcat8 restart_web_server: true tasks: - include_role: name: newrelic.newrelic_java_agent Copy The vars section contains a dictionary called nr_java_agent_config, which holds settings for the agent itself, and a number of variables for configuring the role's installation process. See the sections on agent configuration and role configuration for details. Step 3. Configure the role These variables are used to configure the install process. Most are required. For more information, see the examples on GitHub. Variable Description server_type Required. Web server used by your application. Possible values are: tomcat, jetty, and wildfly (standalone mode only). server_root Required. Location of the web server on the host. The agent's JAR, configuration, and (by default) log files will live in a subdirectory of this directory. jvm_conf_file Required. Path to the web server configuration file to reference the New Relic Java agent. For Tomcat, for instance, it's typically the setenv.sh file. If the file doesn't exist, it may be created, depending on the server_type. server_user server_group Required. User and group under which the web server runs. Used to set the ownership of the newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml files. restart_web_server Optional. Default: true. If set to false, the role does not restart the web server after installing the agent. Note that the agent is not activated until the web server is restarted. service_name Required (unless restart_web_server is set to false). Service name under which the web server runs. Used by Ansible to restart the web server after the agent is installed. nr_java_agent_version Optional; default: currentSpecifies the version of the Java agent to install. current will install the latest version. You can also install a specific version, like 5.9.0. For available versions, see Java agent downloads directory. Step 4. Configure the agent The following variables are used to configure the Java agent itself. These are just a few of the available options. For a full list of supported variables, see the README file on GitHub. For more about how to configure the agent, see Java agent configuration. Variable Description license_key Required. Your New Relic license key. app_name Required. Name of the application being instrumented. For more details, see App naming. proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_password proxy_scheme Optional. If you connect to the New Relic collector via a proxy, you can configure your proxy settings with these values. labels Optional. User-configurable custom labels for the agent. Labels are name-value pairs. Names and values are limited to 255 characters and cannot contain colons (:) nor semicolons (;). Value should be a semicolon-separated list of key-value pairs, for example Server:One;Data Center:Primary. Step 5. Enable custom instrumentation (optional) If you want to enable custom instrumentation, you can provide a list of XML files using the custom_instrumentation_files variable. For instance, you can specify that all Java agents being installed should use a file called my_instrumentation.xml by adding something like the following to your playbook: vars: custom_instrumentation_files: - /path/to/my_instrumentation.xml Copy See the README and examples on GitHub for more information. For more help If you need additional help, file an issue at newrelic/newrelic-java-agent-ansible-role on GitHub.",

Locate the newrelic.yml file you received when creating your New Relic account or download one for the version of the agent that you are using. Here is an example build.gradle for working with the individual components (Java agent and API jars). plugins { id 'java' } group 'example_group' version '1.0-SNAPSHOT' sourceCompatibility = 1.8 repositories { mavenCentral() } dependencies { compile group: 'com.newrelic.agent.java', name: 'newrelic-agent', version: '4.11.0' compile group: 'com.newrelic.agent.java', name: 'newrelic-api', version: '4.11.0' } Copy Place newrelic.yml in the same folder as newrelic.jar, unless you specify otherwise in the JVM arg Dnewrelic.config.file. Configure the newrelic.yml file (or JVM system properties) with your license_key and app_name. Pass -javaagent:/path/to/newrelic.jar to the JVM running your application server.

It also records the userId as a custom parameter on the transaction so that it appears in the parameter details of a transaction trace. (Page load timing sometimes is referred to as real user monitoring or RUM.) String userId = req.getParameter(\"userId\"); if (userId != null) { // set the user name to associate with the RUM JavaScript footer // for the current web transaction NewRelic.setUserName(userId); // add a key/value pair to the current transaction NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); } Copy Collect promotion data This part of the API call records the number of times a promotion was viewed so that the metrics can appear on a custom dashboard.

This setting is not included in the newrelic.yml by default. The only time you need to incorporate this setting into your configuration file is if you want to disable @Trace annotations altogether. To do this, set enable_custom_tracing: false (prefaced with two spaces) in the common stanza of your newrelic.yml. To detect custom traces: Make sure that newrelic-api.jar appears in your classpath. Add @Trace annotations to your code. In each class containing a method you want to instrument, call: import com.newrelic.api.agent.Trace; Copy Place the @Trace annotation on each target method. Tip The annotation com.newrelic.api.agent.Trace is located in the newrelic-api.jar. Create a new transaction If transactions do not appear and you want to start a new transaction, include dispatcher=true with the @Trace annotation: @Trace (dispatcher=true) public void run() { // background task } Copy Add detail to your transactions If your transaction traces show large blocks of uninstrumented time and you want to include some more methods within the trace, you can use the @Trace annotation without parameters: @Trace protected void methodWithinTransaction() { // work } Copy Convert a transaction to a web request To make a background task report as a web browser transaction with a Java agent API call: In the method annotated with @Trace(dispatcher=true), call: NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(Request request, Response response) Copy The arguments are implementations of the Request and Response interfaces in newrelic-api.jar. Important Even if your Request and Response objects already are present, you still need to add this API call. Define your own @Trace annotation class If you define your own @Trace annotation class, there is no dependency on the newrelic-api.jar. To define the class: package com.test; @Target(ElementType.METHOD) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) public @interface Trace { public static final String NULL = \"\"; String metricName() default NULL; boolean dispatcher() default false; String tracerFactoryName() default NULL; } Copy Then, configure the agent to use this annotation in the common section of the newrelic.yml: class_transformer: trace_annotation_class_name: com.test.Trace Copy Properties for @Trace The @Trace annotation supports the following properties. dispatcher Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent will start a transaction when it reaches a method with this @Trace annotation if a transaction is not already in progress. If a transaction is already in progress, the method with this annotation will be included in the ongoing transaction, rather than starting a new one. If false (default), no metrics will be recorded if the agent has not started a transaction before the @Trace annotation is reached. For example: @Trace(dispatcher=true) Copy async Type: Boolean Default: false If true, this method is marked as asynchronous and the agent will trace this method if it linked to an existing transaction. For example: @Trace(async=true) Copy If false (default), the method is not marked as asynchronous. If other @Trace annotations are present and the method is not executing asynchronously, it will still be traced. metricName Type: String Default: (none) This property affects transaction traces and error reporting. By default, the metric name will include the class name followed by the method name. If you do not want class followed by method, then you can use this property to change the metric name. If you set the metricName, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\"), then the time spent in this method will appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. If you set the metricName in addition to the dispatcher, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\", dispatcher=true), then the transaction name will appear as YourMessageHere in the APM Transactions page but the time spent in this method will not appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. Here is an example: @Trace(metricName=\"YourMetricName\") Copy Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. excludeFromTransactionTrace Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the method will be excluded from the transaction trace. The agent will still collect metrics for the method. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true) Copy leaf Type: Boolean Default: false A leaf tracer has no child tracers. This is useful when you want all time attributed to the tracer, even if other trace points are encountered the tracer's execution. Database tracers often act as a leaf so that all time is attributed to database activity, even if instrumented external calls are made. Here is an example: @Trace(leaf=true) Copy If a leaf tracer does not participate in transaction traces, the agent can create a tracer with lower overhead. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true, leaf=true) Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction.",

      "body": "New Relic's Java agent collects and reports information on web transactions and non-web transactions, such as background tasks. The agent should instrument supported frameworks automatically, without any need to modify your application code. However, in addition to custom code and frameworks or technology not listed in the Compatibility and requirements for the Java agent documentation, some implementations of supported frameworks may require custom instrumentation. This document describes how to use the Java agent API to instrument external calls, messaging frameworks, cross application tracing (CAT), datastores, and web frameworks. For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 3.36.0 or higher. External API The External API enables applications to report external service calls to New Relic. This information appears on the External services page in APM. To report HTTP external activity, simply create an instance of ExternalParameters using the HttpParameters builder, and call reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters parameters) on the traced method you want to report. External API String library = \"HttpClient\"; // a user-recognizable name for the library that is being used URI uri = request.getURI(); // the URI that is being requested String procedure = \"execute\"; // these are typically named after the method in the library that's being instrumented // construct external parameters ExternalParameters params = HttpParameters .library(library) .uri(uri) .procedure(procedure) .inboundHeaders(inboundHeaders) .build(); // report the current method as doing external activity NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().reportAsExternal(params); Copy External parameters builders There are several builders to create ExternalParameters: DatastoreParameters HttpParameters GenericParameters MessageConsumeParameters MessageProduceParameters These builders create the input parameter object for TracedMethod's reportAsExternal API call. These parameter objects are used for things like linking HTTP external calls via cross application tracing, tracing external calls to a datastore, tracing external calls to a datastore with additional slow query processing, as well as tracing calls between message producers and consumers. Important All of the methods of this class have the potential to expose sensitive private information. Use caution when creating the arguments, paying particular attention to URIs and string values. Cross application tracing API The cross application tracing (CAT) API allows the New Relic Java agent to link transactions across applications monitored by New Relic. The API uses client and server wrappers that allow the agent to read headers from requests, and add headers to responses. Client wrappers For the agent to write outbound request headers in the client initiating the request, use the OutboundHeaders interface. For example: OutbounderHeaders implementation class OutboundWrapper implements OutboundHeaders { private final HttpUriRequest delegate; // OutboundHeaders is implemented by delegating to the library's request object public OutboundWrapper(HttpUriRequest request) { this.delegate = request; } // This allows the agent to add the correct headers to the HTTP request @Override public void setHeader(String name, String value) { delegate.addHeader(name, value); } // New Relic CAT specifies different header names for HTTP and MESSAGE @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } } Copy For the agent to read inbound response headers in the client receiving the response, implement the InboundHeaders. For example: InboundHeaders implementation class InboundWrapper implements InboundHeaders { private final CloseableHttpResponse responseHeaders; // OutboundHeaders is implemented by delegating to the library's response object public InboundWrapper(CloseableHttpResponse responseHeaders) { this.responseHeaders = responseHeaders; } // New Relic CAT specifies different header names for HTTP and MESSAGE @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } // this allows the agent to read the correct headers from the HTTP response @Override public String getHeader(String name) { return responseHeaders.getFirstHeader(name).getValue(); } } Copy Server wrappers For the agent to get web request headers, you must extend the ExtendedRequest class: Extend ExtendedRequest class // Extend ExtendedRequest class to create a wrapper for the Request object class RequestWrapper extends ExtendedRequest { private IHTTPSession session; public RequestWrapper(IHTTPSession session) { super(); this.session = session; } @Override public String getRequestURI() { return session.getUri(); } @Override public String getHeader(String name) { return session.getHeaders().get(name); } @Override public String getRemoteUser() { return null; } @SuppressWarnings(\"rawtypes\") @Override public Enumeration getParameterNames() { return Collections.enumeration(session.getParms().keySet()); } @Override public String[] getParameterValues(String name) { return new String[]{session.getParms().get(name)}; } @Override public Object getAttribute(String name) { return null; } @Override public String getCookieValue(String name) { return null; } @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } @Override public String getMethod() { return session.getMethod().toString(); } } Copy For the agent to set the web response headers, implement the Response interface: Response interface implementation // Implement Response interface to create a wrapper for the outgoing Response object public class ResponseWrapper implements com.newrelic.api.agent.Response { private final Response httpResponse; public ResponseWrapper(Response httpResponse) { this.httpResponse = httpResponse; } @Override public int getStatus() throws Exception { return 200; } @Override public String getStatusMessage() throws Exception { return null; } @Override public void setHeader(String name, String value) { httpResponse.addHeader(name, value); } @Override public String getContentType() { return \"\"; } @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } } Copy CAT implementation using wrappers Using the wrapper objects described in the previous sections, you can enable the Java agent to do cross application tracing (CAT) on the client and server side. For example: Cross application tracing: Client-side @Trace public int makeExternalCall(URI uri) throws IOException { String library = \"HTTPClient\"; String procedure = \"Execute\"; HttpUriRequest request = RequestBuilder.get().setUri(uri).build(); // Wrap the outbound Request object OutboundWrapper outboundHeaders = new OutboundWrapper(request); // Obtain a reference to the method currently being traced TracedMethod tracedMethod = NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod(); // Add headers for outbound external request tracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(outboundHeaders); CloseableHttpClient connection = HttpClientBuilder.create().build(); CloseableHttpResponse response = connection.execute(request); // Wrap the incoming Response object InboundWrapper inboundHeaders = new InboundWrapper(response); // Create an input parameter object for a call to an external HTTP service ExternalParameters params = HttpParameters .library(library) .uri(uri) .procedure(procedure) .inboundHeaders(inboundHeaders) .build(); // Report a call to an external HTTP service tracedMethod.reportAsExternal(params); return response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode(); } Copy In this sample code, the agent is configured to report an external call using CAT on the client that is initiating the request. These steps can be summarized as follows: Implement OutboundHeaders and InboundHeaders using framework classes on the client. Use addOutboundRequestHeaders(OutboundHeaders outboundHeaders) to have the agent add appropriate headers to the outbound request. Create ExternalParameters object using HttpParameters builder and provide inbound response headers. Report as an external request using reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters params). Cross application tracing: Server-side @Trace(dispatcher = true) @Override public Response serve(IHTTPSession session) { // Obtain a reference to the current Transaction Transaction tx = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(); // Set the name of the current transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(\"Custom\", \"ExternalHTTPServer\"); // Wrap the Request object ExtendedRequest req = new RequestWrapper(session); // Set the request for the current transaction and convert it into a web transaction tx.setWebRequest(req); queryDB(); Response res = newFixedLengthResponse(\"<html><body><h1>SuccessfulResponse</h1>\\n</body></html>\\n\"); // Set the response for the current transaction and convert it into a web transaction tx.setWebResponse(new ResponseWrapper(res)); // Instruct the transaction to write the outbound response headers tx.addOutboundResponseHeaders(); // Mark the time when the response left the server tx.markResponseSent(); return res; } Copy In this sample code, the agent is configured to report an external call using CAT on the server that is responding to the request. These steps can be summarized as follows: Implement Response and extend the ExtendedRequest class using framework classes on the server. Use setWebRequest(ExtendedRequest request) and setWebResponse(Response response) to convert the transaction into a web transaction and together provide the agent with the inbound request headers and a place to record the outbound headers. It's important to use both setWebRequest(ExtendedRequest request) and setWebResponse(Response response) together, because the transaction name depends on the request object, and the response code depends on the response object. Use addOutboundResponseHeaders() to have the agent add appropriate headers to the outbound response. Mark the end of the response with a call to markResponseSent(). Messaging API The messaging API allows applications to report interactions with message queue brokers. It builds on top of the External API by providing the MessageConsumerParametersMessage and MessageConsumerParameters. This API generates the necessary metrics to identify message broker interactions. The UI will use these metrics to display messaging data including segments in transactions with the appropriate action and count (message put, or message take), a dedicated messages tab in transaction traces, and more. Providing inbound and outbound headers to the API also allows the agent to add CAT headers, and record CAT metrics, which enables the UI to draw service maps that show connections between applications. Important The messaging API relies on two-way communication between producers and consumers. If your producer does not receive an acknowledgment from a consumer, like in a fire-and-forget pattern, the messaging API will not accurately reflect the interactions with message queue brokers. The following example demonstrates how to instrument a fictional JMS library. Messaging API implementation public class MessageProducer { // instrument the method that puts messages on a queue @Trace public void sendMessageToQueue(Message message) { ExternalParameters messageProduceParameters = MessageProduceParameters.library(\"JMS\") .destinationType(DestinationType.NAMED_QUEUE) .destinationName(message.getJMSDestination()) .outboundHeaders(new OutboundWrapper(message)) .build(); NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().reportAsExternal(messageProduceParameters); } } Copy To simplify things, the agent assumes that sendMessageToQueue always puts a message in a named queue. In reality, a message can be sent to different destination types, including named queues, temporary queues, topics, and temporary topics. The API provides an enum to report messages to different destination types: NAMED_QUEUE, TEMP_QUEUE, NAMED_TOPIC, TEMP_TOPIC. It's important to specify the appropriate destination type because the UI will display the names of named queues and named topics and will omit the names of temporary queues and temporary topics. If the library is capable of transmitting CAT headers, an OutboundHeaders object will be provided to the API so that the agent can add CAT headers. Message with CAT headers implementation public class MessageConsumer { @Trace public Message messageReceive() { ExternalParameters messageConsumeParameters = MessageConsumeParameters.library(\"JMS\") .destinationType(DestinationType.NAMED_QUEUE) .destinationName(message.getJMSDestination()) .inboundHeaders(new InboundWrapper(message)) .build(); NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().reportAsExternal(messageConsumeParameters); return message; } } Copy Datastore API When a traced method is reported as an external datastore call, the call is shown in the APM Databases page. Because datastores are external to the running application, the method is reported as datastore activity using the reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters params) method. The only difference is that a different builder, DatastoreParameters, is used to create the appropriate ExternalParameters object. Datastore API implementation TracedMethod tracedMethod = NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod(); tracedMethod.reportAsExternal( DatastoreParameters .product(\"sqlite\") // the datastore vendor .collection(\"test.db\") // the name of the collection (or table for SQL databases) .operation(\"select\") // the operation being performed, e.g. \"SELECT\" or \"UPDATE\" for SQL databases .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) // the datastore instance information - generally can be found as part of the connection .databaseName(\"test.db\") // may be null, indicating no keyspace for the command .build()); Copy Datastore API: Slow query This API call provides the same behavior as the Datastore API call and extends it to allow slow query information to be tracked. The same reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters params) method and builder are used, but with an additional builder method. Datastore with slow query implementation Creating the appropriate ExternalParameters object is illustrated below: //Reporting a method as doing datastore activity TracedMethod tracedMethod = NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod(); tracedMethod.reportAsExternal( DatastoreParameters .product(\"sqlite\") // the datastore vendor .collection(\"test.db\") // the name of the collection (or table for SQL databases) .operation(\"select\") // the operation being performed, e.g. \"SELECT\" or \"UPDATE\" for SQL databases .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) // the datastore instance information - generally can be found as part of the connection .databaseName(\"test.db\") // may be null, indicating no keyspace for the command .slowQuery(rawQuery,QUERY_CONVERTER) .build()); private static QueryConverter<String> QUERY_CONVERTER = new QueryConverter<String>() { @Override public String toRawQueryString(String statement) { // Do work to transform raw query object to string return statement; } @Override public String toObfuscatedQueryString(String statement) { // Do work to remove any sensitive information here return obfuscateQuery(statement); } }; Copy WebFrameworks API The WebFrameworks API allows the agent to report additional identifying information about the application. // Set the dispatcher name and version which is reported to APM. // The dispatcherName is intended to represent the type of server that this // application is running on such as: Tomcat, Jetty, Netty, etc. NewRelic.setServerInfo(String dispatcherName, String version) // Set the app server port which is reported to APM. NewRelic.setAppServerPort(int port) // Set the instance name in the environment. // A single host:port may support multiple JVM instances. // The instance name is intended to help identify a specific JVM instance. NewRelic.setInstanceName(String instanceName) Copy Tip These values can be set only once. Subsequent calls will have no effect. WebFrameworks API implementation public NewRelicApiClient() throws IOException, URISyntaxException { super(8080); // Set Dispatcher name and version. NewRelic.setServerInfo(\"NanoHttp\", \"2.3.1\"); // Set Appserver port for jvm identification NewRelic.setAppServerPort(8080); // Set JVM instance name NewRelic.setInstanceName(\"Client:8080\"); start(NanoHTTPD.SOCKET_READ_TIMEOUT, false); System.out.println(\"\\nRunning on http://localhost:8080/ \\n\"); } Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: New Relic Java agent API Javadoc (detailed API documentation on GitHub) Java agent API example (example application using custom instrumentation for cross application tracing and external datastore calls) Java agent API guide (goal-driven guide to using the Java agent API) Java instrumentation by annotation (how to use annotations to instrument your application code)",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction.

See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references.

      "body": "New Relic's Java agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. One of those options is adding the Java agent API's @Trace annotations to your application code. This document describes how to use annotations. Important To use annotations, you must modify the source code. If you can't or don't want to modify your source code, see Custom instrumentation for other instrumentation options. Configure your agent for annotations By default, the configuration setting enable_custom_tracing is set to true in the Java agent, which is the setting required for @Trace annotations to function. This setting is not included in the newrelic.yml by default. The only time you need to incorporate this setting into your configuration file is if you want to disable @Trace annotations altogether. To do this, set enable_custom_tracing: false (prefaced with two spaces) in the common stanza of your newrelic.yml. To detect custom traces: Make sure that newrelic-api.jar appears in your classpath. Add @Trace annotations to your code. In each class containing a method you want to instrument, call: import com.newrelic.api.agent.Trace; Copy Place the @Trace annotation on each target method. Tip The annotation com.newrelic.api.agent.Trace is located in the newrelic-api.jar. Create a new transaction If transactions do not appear and you want to start a new transaction, include dispatcher=true with the @Trace annotation: @Trace (dispatcher=true) public void run() { // background task } Copy Add detail to your transactions If your transaction traces show large blocks of uninstrumented time and you want to include some more methods within the trace, you can use the @Trace annotation without parameters: @Trace protected void methodWithinTransaction() { // work } Copy Convert a transaction to a web request To make a background task report as a web browser transaction with a Java agent API call: In the method annotated with @Trace(dispatcher=true), call: NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(Request request, Response response) Copy The arguments are implementations of the Request and Response interfaces in newrelic-api.jar. Important Even if your Request and Response objects already are present, you still need to add this API call. Define your own @Trace annotation class If you define your own @Trace annotation class, there is no dependency on the newrelic-api.jar. To define the class: package com.test; @Target(ElementType.METHOD) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) public @interface Trace { public static final String NULL = \"\"; String metricName() default NULL; boolean dispatcher() default false; String tracerFactoryName() default NULL; } Copy Then, configure the agent to use this annotation in the common section of the newrelic.yml: class_transformer: trace_annotation_class_name: com.test.Trace Copy Properties for @Trace The @Trace annotation supports the following properties. dispatcher Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent will start a transaction when it reaches a method with this @Trace annotation if a transaction is not already in progress. If a transaction is already in progress, the method with this annotation will be included in the ongoing transaction, rather than starting a new one. If false (default), no metrics will be recorded if the agent has not started a transaction before the @Trace annotation is reached. For example: @Trace(dispatcher=true) Copy async Type: Boolean Default: false If true, this method is marked as asynchronous and the agent will trace this method if it linked to an existing transaction. For example: @Trace(async=true) Copy If false (default), the method is not marked as asynchronous. If other @Trace annotations are present and the method is not executing asynchronously, it will still be traced. metricName Type: String Default: (none) This property affects transaction traces and error reporting. By default, the metric name will include the class name followed by the method name. If you do not want class followed by method, then you can use this property to change the metric name. If you set the metricName, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\"), then the time spent in this method will appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. If you set the metricName in addition to the dispatcher, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\", dispatcher=true), then the transaction name will appear as YourMessageHere in the APM Transactions page but the time spent in this method will not appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. Here is an example: @Trace(metricName=\"YourMetricName\") Copy Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. excludeFromTransactionTrace Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the method will be excluded from the transaction trace. The agent will still collect metrics for the method. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true) Copy leaf Type: Boolean Default: false A leaf tracer has no child tracers. This is useful when you want all time attributed to the tracer, even if other trace points are encountered the tracer's execution. Database tracers often act as a leaf so that all time is attributed to database activity, even if instrumented external calls are made. Here is an example: @Trace(leaf=true) Copy If a leaf tracer does not participate in transaction traces, the agent can create a tracer with lower overhead. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true, leaf=true) Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction.",

      "body": "New Relic's Java agent collects and reports information on web transactions and non-web transactions, such as background tasks. The agent should instrument supported frameworks automatically, without any need to modify your application code. However, in addition to custom code and frameworks or technology not listed in the Compatibility and requirements for the Java agent documentation, some implementations of supported frameworks may require custom instrumentation. This document describes how to use the Java agent API to instrument external calls, messaging frameworks, cross application tracing (CAT), datastores, and web frameworks. For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 3.36.0 or higher. External API The External API enables applications to report external service calls to New Relic. This information appears on the External services page in APM. To report HTTP external activity, simply create an instance of ExternalParameters using the HttpParameters builder, and call reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters parameters) on the traced method you want to report. External API String library = \"HttpClient\"; // a user-recognizable name for the library that is being used URI uri = request.getURI(); // the URI that is being requested String procedure = \"execute\"; // these are typically named after the method in the library that's being instrumented // construct external parameters ExternalParameters params = HttpParameters .library(library) .uri(uri) .procedure(procedure) .inboundHeaders(inboundHeaders) .build(); // report the current method as doing external activity NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().reportAsExternal(params); Copy External parameters builders There are several builders to create ExternalParameters: DatastoreParameters HttpParameters GenericParameters MessageConsumeParameters MessageProduceParameters These builders create the input parameter object for TracedMethod's reportAsExternal API call. These parameter objects are used for things like linking HTTP external calls via cross application tracing, tracing external calls to a datastore, tracing external calls to a datastore with additional slow query processing, as well as tracing calls between message producers and consumers. Important All of the methods of this class have the potential to expose sensitive private information. Use caution when creating the arguments, paying particular attention to URIs and string values. Cross application tracing API The cross application tracing (CAT) API allows the New Relic Java agent to link transactions across applications monitored by New Relic. The API uses client and server wrappers that allow the agent to read headers from requests, and add headers to responses. Client wrappers For the agent to write outbound request headers in the client initiating the request, use the OutboundHeaders interface. For example: OutbounderHeaders implementation class OutboundWrapper implements OutboundHeaders { private final HttpUriRequest delegate; // OutboundHeaders is implemented by delegating to the library's request object public OutboundWrapper(HttpUriRequest request) { this.delegate = request; } // This allows the agent to add the correct headers to the HTTP request @Override public void setHeader(String name, String value) { delegate.addHeader(name, value); } // New Relic CAT specifies different header names for HTTP and MESSAGE @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } } Copy For the agent to read inbound response headers in the client receiving the response, implement the InboundHeaders. For example: InboundHeaders implementation class InboundWrapper implements InboundHeaders { private final CloseableHttpResponse responseHeaders; // OutboundHeaders is implemented by delegating to the library's response object public InboundWrapper(CloseableHttpResponse responseHeaders) { this.responseHeaders = responseHeaders; } // New Relic CAT specifies different header names for HTTP and MESSAGE @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } // this allows the agent to read the correct headers from the HTTP response @Override public String getHeader(String name) { return responseHeaders.getFirstHeader(name).getValue(); } } Copy Server wrappers For the agent to get web request headers, you must extend the ExtendedRequest class: Extend ExtendedRequest class // Extend ExtendedRequest class to create a wrapper for the Request object class RequestWrapper extends ExtendedRequest { private IHTTPSession session; public RequestWrapper(IHTTPSession session) { super(); this.session = session; } @Override public String getRequestURI() { return session.getUri(); } @Override public String getHeader(String name) { return session.getHeaders().get(name); } @Override public String getRemoteUser() { return null; } @SuppressWarnings(\"rawtypes\") @Override public Enumeration getParameterNames() { return Collections.enumeration(session.getParms().keySet()); } @Override public String[] getParameterValues(String name) { return new String[]{session.getParms().get(name)}; } @Override public Object getAttribute(String name) { return null; } @Override public String getCookieValue(String name) { return null; } @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } @Override public String getMethod() { return session.getMethod().toString(); } } Copy For the agent to set the web response headers, implement the Response interface: Response interface implementation // Implement Response interface to create a wrapper for the outgoing Response object public class ResponseWrapper implements com.newrelic.api.agent.Response { private final Response httpResponse; public ResponseWrapper(Response httpResponse) { this.httpResponse = httpResponse; } @Override public int getStatus() throws Exception { return 200; } @Override public String getStatusMessage() throws Exception { return null; } @Override public void setHeader(String name, String value) { httpResponse.addHeader(name, value); } @Override public String getContentType() { return \"\"; } @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } } Copy CAT implementation using wrappers Using the wrapper objects described in the previous sections, you can enable the Java agent to do cross application tracing (CAT) on the client and server side. For example: Cross application tracing: Client-side @Trace public int makeExternalCall(URI uri) throws IOException { String library = \"HTTPClient\"; String procedure = \"Execute\"; HttpUriRequest request = RequestBuilder.get().setUri(uri).build(); // Wrap the outbound Request object OutboundWrapper outboundHeaders = new OutboundWrapper(request); // Obtain a reference to the method currently being traced TracedMethod tracedMethod = NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod(); // Add headers for outbound external request tracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(outboundHeaders); CloseableHttpClient connection = HttpClientBuilder.create().build(); CloseableHttpResponse response = connection.execute(request); // Wrap the incoming Response object InboundWrapper inboundHeaders = new InboundWrapper(response); // Create an input parameter object for a call to an external HTTP service ExternalParameters params = HttpParameters .library(library) .uri(uri) .procedure(procedure) .inboundHeaders(inboundHeaders) .build(); // Report a call to an external HTTP service tracedMethod.reportAsExternal(params); return response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode(); } Copy In this sample code, the agent is configured to report an external call using CAT on the client that is initiating the request. These steps can be summarized as follows: Implement OutboundHeaders and InboundHeaders using framework classes on the client. Use addOutboundRequestHeaders(OutboundHeaders outboundHeaders) to have the agent add appropriate headers to the outbound request. Create ExternalParameters object using HttpParameters builder and provide inbound response headers. Report as an external request using reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters params). Cross application tracing: Server-side @Trace(dispatcher = true) @Override public Response serve(IHTTPSession session) { // Obtain a reference to the current Transaction Transaction tx = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(); // Set the name of the current transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(\"Custom\", \"ExternalHTTPServer\"); // Wrap the Request object ExtendedRequest req = new RequestWrapper(session); // Set the request for the current transaction and convert it into a web transaction tx.setWebRequest(req); queryDB(); Response res = newFixedLengthResponse(\"<html><body><h1>SuccessfulResponse</h1>\\n</body></html>\\n\"); // Set the response for the current transaction and convert it into a web transaction tx.setWebResponse(new ResponseWrapper(res)); // Instruct the transaction to write the outbound response headers tx.addOutboundResponseHeaders(); // Mark the time when the response left the server tx.markResponseSent(); return res; } Copy In this sample code, the agent is configured to report an external call using CAT on the server that is responding to the request. These steps can be summarized as follows: Implement Response and extend the ExtendedRequest class using framework classes on the server. Use setWebRequest(ExtendedRequest request) and setWebResponse(Response response) to convert the transaction into a web transaction and together provide the agent with the inbound request headers and a place to record the outbound headers. It's important to use both setWebRequest(ExtendedRequest request) and setWebResponse(Response response) together, because the transaction name depends on the request object, and the response code depends on the response object. Use addOutboundResponseHeaders() to have the agent add appropriate headers to the outbound response. Mark the end of the response with a call to markResponseSent(). Messaging API The messaging API allows applications to report interactions with message queue brokers. It builds on top of the External API by providing the MessageConsumerParametersMessage and MessageConsumerParameters. This API generates the necessary metrics to identify message broker interactions. The UI will use these metrics to display messaging data including segments in transactions with the appropriate action and count (message put, or message take), a dedicated messages tab in transaction traces, and more. Providing inbound and outbound headers to the API also allows the agent to add CAT headers, and record CAT metrics, which enables the UI to draw service maps that show connections between applications. Important The messaging API relies on two-way communication between producers and consumers. If your producer does not receive an acknowledgment from a consumer, like in a fire-and-forget pattern, the messaging API will not accurately reflect the interactions with message queue brokers. The following example demonstrates how to instrument a fictional JMS library. Messaging API implementation public class MessageProducer { // instrument the method that puts messages on a queue @Trace public void sendMessageToQueue(Message message) { ExternalParameters messageProduceParameters = MessageProduceParameters.library(\"JMS\") .destinationType(DestinationType.NAMED_QUEUE) .destinationName(message.getJMSDestination()) .outboundHeaders(new OutboundWrapper(message)) .build(); NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().reportAsExternal(messageProduceParameters); } } Copy To simplify things, the agent assumes that sendMessageToQueue always puts a message in a named queue. In reality, a message can be sent to different destination types, including named queues, temporary queues, topics, and temporary topics. The API provides an enum to report messages to different destination types: NAMED_QUEUE, TEMP_QUEUE, NAMED_TOPIC, TEMP_TOPIC. It's important to specify the appropriate destination type because the UI will display the names of named queues and named topics and will omit the names of temporary queues and temporary topics. If the library is capable of transmitting CAT headers, an OutboundHeaders object will be provided to the API so that the agent can add CAT headers. Message with CAT headers implementation public class MessageConsumer { @Trace public Message messageReceive() { ExternalParameters messageConsumeParameters = MessageConsumeParameters.library(\"JMS\") .destinationType(DestinationType.NAMED_QUEUE) .destinationName(message.getJMSDestination()) .inboundHeaders(new InboundWrapper(message)) .build(); NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().reportAsExternal(messageConsumeParameters); return message; } } Copy Datastore API When a traced method is reported as an external datastore call, the call is shown in the APM Databases page. Because datastores are external to the running application, the method is reported as datastore activity using the reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters params) method. The only difference is that a different builder, DatastoreParameters, is used to create the appropriate ExternalParameters object. Datastore API implementation TracedMethod tracedMethod = NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod(); tracedMethod.reportAsExternal( DatastoreParameters .product(\"sqlite\") // the datastore vendor .collection(\"test.db\") // the name of the collection (or table for SQL databases) .operation(\"select\") // the operation being performed, e.g. \"SELECT\" or \"UPDATE\" for SQL databases .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) // the datastore instance information - generally can be found as part of the connection .databaseName(\"test.db\") // may be null, indicating no keyspace for the command .build()); Copy Datastore API: Slow query This API call provides the same behavior as the Datastore API call and extends it to allow slow query information to be tracked. The same reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters params) method and builder are used, but with an additional builder method. Datastore with slow query implementation Creating the appropriate ExternalParameters object is illustrated below: //Reporting a method as doing datastore activity TracedMethod tracedMethod = NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod(); tracedMethod.reportAsExternal( DatastoreParameters .product(\"sqlite\") // the datastore vendor .collection(\"test.db\") // the name of the collection (or table for SQL databases) .operation(\"select\") // the operation being performed, e.g. \"SELECT\" or \"UPDATE\" for SQL databases .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) // the datastore instance information - generally can be found as part of the connection .databaseName(\"test.db\") // may be null, indicating no keyspace for the command .slowQuery(rawQuery,QUERY_CONVERTER) .build()); private static QueryConverter<String> QUERY_CONVERTER = new QueryConverter<String>() { @Override public String toRawQueryString(String statement) { // Do work to transform raw query object to string return statement; } @Override public String toObfuscatedQueryString(String statement) { // Do work to remove any sensitive information here return obfuscateQuery(statement); } }; Copy WebFrameworks API The WebFrameworks API allows the agent to report additional identifying information about the application. // Set the dispatcher name and version which is reported to APM. // The dispatcherName is intended to represent the type of server that this // application is running on such as: Tomcat, Jetty, Netty, etc. NewRelic.setServerInfo(String dispatcherName, String version) // Set the app server port which is reported to APM. NewRelic.setAppServerPort(int port) // Set the instance name in the environment. // A single host:port may support multiple JVM instances. // The instance name is intended to help identify a specific JVM instance. NewRelic.setInstanceName(String instanceName) Copy Tip These values can be set only once. Subsequent calls will have no effect. WebFrameworks API implementation public NewRelicApiClient() throws IOException, URISyntaxException { super(8080); // Set Dispatcher name and version. NewRelic.setServerInfo(\"NanoHttp\", \"2.3.1\"); // Set Appserver port for jvm identification NewRelic.setAppServerPort(8080); // Set JVM instance name NewRelic.setInstanceName(\"Client:8080\"); start(NanoHTTPD.SOCKET_READ_TIMEOUT, false); System.out.println(\"\\nRunning on http://localhost:8080/ \\n\"); } Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: New Relic Java agent API Javadoc (detailed API documentation on GitHub) Java agent API example (example application using custom instrumentation for cross application tracing and external datastore calls) Java agent API guide (goal-driven guide to using the Java agent API) Java instrumentation by annotation (how to use annotations to instrument your application code)",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

It also records the userId as a custom parameter on the transaction so that it appears in the parameter details of a transaction trace. (Page load timing sometimes is referred to as real user monitoring or RUM.) String userId = req.getParameter(\"userId\"); if (userId != null) { // set the user name to associate with the RUM JavaScript footer // for the current web transaction NewRelic.setUserName(userId); // add a key/value pair to the current transaction NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); } Copy Collect promotion data This part of the API call records the number of times a promotion was viewed so that the metrics can appear on a custom dashboard. Important For metrics you want to graph in custom dashboards, be sure to prepend Custom/ to the metric name; for example, Custom/Promotion. String promotionId = req.getParameter(\"promotionId\"); if (promotionId != null) { // increment the metric counter for the given name NewRelic.incrementCounter(\"Custom/Promotion\"); } Copy Send instructions to the handler This part of the API call sends a set of instructions to the handler for processing requests and handling exceptions. protected void doRequestWork(HttpServletRequest req) { try { long millisToSleep = new Random().nextInt(5000); Thread.sleep(millisToSleep); // record a response time in milliseconds for the given metric name NewRelic.recordResponseTimeMetric(\"Custom/RandomSleep\", millisToSleep); } catch (InterruptedException e) { // report a handled exception NewRelic.noticeError(e, false); } } protected void writeResponse(HttpServletResponse resp) throws IOException { Copy Include page load timing code in the HTTP response This part of the API call defines what to include in the HttpServletResponse.

      "body": "New Relic's Java agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. One of those options is adding the Java agent API's @Trace annotations to your application code. This document describes how to use annotations. Important To use annotations, you must modify the source code. If you can't or don't want to modify your source code, see Custom instrumentation for other instrumentation options. Configure your agent for annotations By default, the configuration setting enable_custom_tracing is set to true in the Java agent, which is the setting required for @Trace annotations to function. This setting is not included in the newrelic.yml by default. The only time you need to incorporate this setting into your configuration file is if you want to disable @Trace annotations altogether. To do this, set enable_custom_tracing: false (prefaced with two spaces) in the common stanza of your newrelic.yml. To detect custom traces: Make sure that newrelic-api.jar appears in your classpath. Add @Trace annotations to your code. In each class containing a method you want to instrument, call: import com.newrelic.api.agent.Trace; Copy Place the @Trace annotation on each target method. Tip The annotation com.newrelic.api.agent.Trace is located in the newrelic-api.jar. Create a new transaction If transactions do not appear and you want to start a new transaction, include dispatcher=true with the @Trace annotation: @Trace (dispatcher=true) public void run() { // background task } Copy Add detail to your transactions If your transaction traces show large blocks of uninstrumented time and you want to include some more methods within the trace, you can use the @Trace annotation without parameters: @Trace protected void methodWithinTransaction() { // work } Copy Convert a transaction to a web request To make a background task report as a web browser transaction with a Java agent API call: In the method annotated with @Trace(dispatcher=true), call: NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(Request request, Response response) Copy The arguments are implementations of the Request and Response interfaces in newrelic-api.jar. Important Even if your Request and Response objects already are present, you still need to add this API call. Define your own @Trace annotation class If you define your own @Trace annotation class, there is no dependency on the newrelic-api.jar. To define the class: package com.test; @Target(ElementType.METHOD) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) public @interface Trace { public static final String NULL = \"\"; String metricName() default NULL; boolean dispatcher() default false; String tracerFactoryName() default NULL; } Copy Then, configure the agent to use this annotation in the common section of the newrelic.yml: class_transformer: trace_annotation_class_name: com.test.Trace Copy Properties for @Trace The @Trace annotation supports the following properties. dispatcher Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent will start a transaction when it reaches a method with this @Trace annotation if a transaction is not already in progress. If a transaction is already in progress, the method with this annotation will be included in the ongoing transaction, rather than starting a new one. If false (default), no metrics will be recorded if the agent has not started a transaction before the @Trace annotation is reached. For example: @Trace(dispatcher=true) Copy async Type: Boolean Default: false If true, this method is marked as asynchronous and the agent will trace this method if it linked to an existing transaction. For example: @Trace(async=true) Copy If false (default), the method is not marked as asynchronous. If other @Trace annotations are present and the method is not executing asynchronously, it will still be traced. metricName Type: String Default: (none) This property affects transaction traces and error reporting. By default, the metric name will include the class name followed by the method name. If you do not want class followed by method, then you can use this property to change the metric name. If you set the metricName, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\"), then the time spent in this method will appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. If you set the metricName in addition to the dispatcher, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\", dispatcher=true), then the transaction name will appear as YourMessageHere in the APM Transactions page but the time spent in this method will not appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. Here is an example: @Trace(metricName=\"YourMetricName\") Copy Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. excludeFromTransactionTrace Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the method will be excluded from the transaction trace. The agent will still collect metrics for the method. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true) Copy leaf Type: Boolean Default: false A leaf tracer has no child tracers. This is useful when you want all time attributed to the tracer, even if other trace points are encountered the tracer's execution. Database tracers often act as a leaf so that all time is attributed to database activity, even if instrumented external calls are made. Here is an example: @Trace(leaf=true) Copy If a leaf tracer does not participate in transaction traces, the agent can create a tracer with lower overhead. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true, leaf=true) Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

It also records the userId as a custom parameter on the transaction so that it appears in the parameter details of a transaction trace. (Page load timing sometimes is referred to as real user monitoring or RUM.) String userId = req.getParameter(\"userId\"); if (userId != null) { // set the user name to associate with the RUM JavaScript footer // for the current web transaction NewRelic.setUserName(userId); // add a key/value pair to the current transaction NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); } Copy Collect promotion data This part of the API call records the number of times a promotion was viewed so that the metrics can appear on a custom dashboard.

      "body": "New Relic's Java agent collects and reports information on web transactions and non-web transactions, such as background tasks. The agent should instrument supported frameworks automatically, without any need to modify your application code. However, in addition to custom code and frameworks or technology not listed in the Compatibility and requirements for the Java agent documentation, some implementations of supported frameworks may require custom instrumentation. This document describes how to use the Java agent API to instrument external calls, messaging frameworks, cross application tracing (CAT), datastores, and web frameworks. For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 3.36.0 or higher. External API The External API enables applications to report external service calls to New Relic. This information appears on the External services page in APM. To report HTTP external activity, simply create an instance of ExternalParameters using the HttpParameters builder, and call reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters parameters) on the traced method you want to report. External API String library = \"HttpClient\"; // a user-recognizable name for the library that is being used URI uri = request.getURI(); // the URI that is being requested String procedure = \"execute\"; // these are typically named after the method in the library that's being instrumented // construct external parameters ExternalParameters params = HttpParameters .library(library) .uri(uri) .procedure(procedure) .inboundHeaders(inboundHeaders) .build(); // report the current method as doing external activity NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().reportAsExternal(params); Copy External parameters builders There are several builders to create ExternalParameters: DatastoreParameters HttpParameters GenericParameters MessageConsumeParameters MessageProduceParameters These builders create the input parameter object for TracedMethod's reportAsExternal API call. These parameter objects are used for things like linking HTTP external calls via cross application tracing, tracing external calls to a datastore, tracing external calls to a datastore with additional slow query processing, as well as tracing calls between message producers and consumers. Important All of the methods of this class have the potential to expose sensitive private information. Use caution when creating the arguments, paying particular attention to URIs and string values. Cross application tracing API The cross application tracing (CAT) API allows the New Relic Java agent to link transactions across applications monitored by New Relic. The API uses client and server wrappers that allow the agent to read headers from requests, and add headers to responses. Client wrappers For the agent to write outbound request headers in the client initiating the request, use the OutboundHeaders interface. For example: OutbounderHeaders implementation class OutboundWrapper implements OutboundHeaders { private final HttpUriRequest delegate; // OutboundHeaders is implemented by delegating to the library's request object public OutboundWrapper(HttpUriRequest request) { this.delegate = request; } // This allows the agent to add the correct headers to the HTTP request @Override public void setHeader(String name, String value) { delegate.addHeader(name, value); } // New Relic CAT specifies different header names for HTTP and MESSAGE @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } } Copy For the agent to read inbound response headers in the client receiving the response, implement the InboundHeaders. For example: InboundHeaders implementation class InboundWrapper implements InboundHeaders { private final CloseableHttpResponse responseHeaders; // OutboundHeaders is implemented by delegating to the library's response object public InboundWrapper(CloseableHttpResponse responseHeaders) { this.responseHeaders = responseHeaders; } // New Relic CAT specifies different header names for HTTP and MESSAGE @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } // this allows the agent to read the correct headers from the HTTP response @Override public String getHeader(String name) { return responseHeaders.getFirstHeader(name).getValue(); } } Copy Server wrappers For the agent to get web request headers, you must extend the ExtendedRequest class: Extend ExtendedRequest class // Extend ExtendedRequest class to create a wrapper for the Request object class RequestWrapper extends ExtendedRequest { private IHTTPSession session; public RequestWrapper(IHTTPSession session) { super(); this.session = session; } @Override public String getRequestURI() { return session.getUri(); } @Override public String getHeader(String name) { return session.getHeaders().get(name); } @Override public String getRemoteUser() { return null; } @SuppressWarnings(\"rawtypes\") @Override public Enumeration getParameterNames() { return Collections.enumeration(session.getParms().keySet()); } @Override public String[] getParameterValues(String name) { return new String[]{session.getParms().get(name)}; } @Override public Object getAttribute(String name) { return null; } @Override public String getCookieValue(String name) { return null; } @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } @Override public String getMethod() { return session.getMethod().toString(); } } Copy For the agent to set the web response headers, implement the Response interface: Response interface implementation // Implement Response interface to create a wrapper for the outgoing Response object public class ResponseWrapper implements com.newrelic.api.agent.Response { private final Response httpResponse; public ResponseWrapper(Response httpResponse) { this.httpResponse = httpResponse; } @Override public int getStatus() throws Exception { return 200; } @Override public String getStatusMessage() throws Exception { return null; } @Override public void setHeader(String name, String value) { httpResponse.addHeader(name, value); } @Override public String getContentType() { return \"\"; } @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } } Copy CAT implementation using wrappers Using the wrapper objects described in the previous sections, you can enable the Java agent to do cross application tracing (CAT) on the client and server side. For example: Cross application tracing: Client-side @Trace public int makeExternalCall(URI uri) throws IOException { String library = \"HTTPClient\"; String procedure = \"Execute\"; HttpUriRequest request = RequestBuilder.get().setUri(uri).build(); // Wrap the outbound Request object OutboundWrapper outboundHeaders = new OutboundWrapper(request); // Obtain a reference to the method currently being traced TracedMethod tracedMethod = NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod(); // Add headers for outbound external request tracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(outboundHeaders); CloseableHttpClient connection = HttpClientBuilder.create().build(); CloseableHttpResponse response = connection.execute(request); // Wrap the incoming Response object InboundWrapper inboundHeaders = new InboundWrapper(response); // Create an input parameter object for a call to an external HTTP service ExternalParameters params = HttpParameters .library(library) .uri(uri) .procedure(procedure) .inboundHeaders(inboundHeaders) .build(); // Report a call to an external HTTP service tracedMethod.reportAsExternal(params); return response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode(); } Copy In this sample code, the agent is configured to report an external call using CAT on the client that is initiating the request. These steps can be summarized as follows: Implement OutboundHeaders and InboundHeaders using framework classes on the client. Use addOutboundRequestHeaders(OutboundHeaders outboundHeaders) to have the agent add appropriate headers to the outbound request. Create ExternalParameters object using HttpParameters builder and provide inbound response headers. Report as an external request using reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters params). Cross application tracing: Server-side @Trace(dispatcher = true) @Override public Response serve(IHTTPSession session) { // Obtain a reference to the current Transaction Transaction tx = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(); // Set the name of the current transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(\"Custom\", \"ExternalHTTPServer\"); // Wrap the Request object ExtendedRequest req = new RequestWrapper(session); // Set the request for the current transaction and convert it into a web transaction tx.setWebRequest(req); queryDB(); Response res = newFixedLengthResponse(\"<html><body><h1>SuccessfulResponse</h1>\\n</body></html>\\n\"); // Set the response for the current transaction and convert it into a web transaction tx.setWebResponse(new ResponseWrapper(res)); // Instruct the transaction to write the outbound response headers tx.addOutboundResponseHeaders(); // Mark the time when the response left the server tx.markResponseSent(); return res; } Copy In this sample code, the agent is configured to report an external call using CAT on the server that is responding to the request. These steps can be summarized as follows: Implement Response and extend the ExtendedRequest class using framework classes on the server. Use setWebRequest(ExtendedRequest request) and setWebResponse(Response response) to convert the transaction into a web transaction and together provide the agent with the inbound request headers and a place to record the outbound headers. It's important to use both setWebRequest(ExtendedRequest request) and setWebResponse(Response response) together, because the transaction name depends on the request object, and the response code depends on the response object. Use addOutboundResponseHeaders() to have the agent add appropriate headers to the outbound response. Mark the end of the response with a call to markResponseSent(). Messaging API The messaging API allows applications to report interactions with message queue brokers. It builds on top of the External API by providing the MessageConsumerParametersMessage and MessageConsumerParameters. This API generates the necessary metrics to identify message broker interactions. The UI will use these metrics to display messaging data including segments in transactions with the appropriate action and count (message put, or message take), a dedicated messages tab in transaction traces, and more. Providing inbound and outbound headers to the API also allows the agent to add CAT headers, and record CAT metrics, which enables the UI to draw service maps that show connections between applications. Important The messaging API relies on two-way communication between producers and consumers. If your producer does not receive an acknowledgment from a consumer, like in a fire-and-forget pattern, the messaging API will not accurately reflect the interactions with message queue brokers. The following example demonstrates how to instrument a fictional JMS library. Messaging API implementation public class MessageProducer { // instrument the method that puts messages on a queue @Trace public void sendMessageToQueue(Message message) { ExternalParameters messageProduceParameters = MessageProduceParameters.library(\"JMS\") .destinationType(DestinationType.NAMED_QUEUE) .destinationName(message.getJMSDestination()) .outboundHeaders(new OutboundWrapper(message)) .build(); NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().reportAsExternal(messageProduceParameters); } } Copy To simplify things, the agent assumes that sendMessageToQueue always puts a message in a named queue. In reality, a message can be sent to different destination types, including named queues, temporary queues, topics, and temporary topics. The API provides an enum to report messages to different destination types: NAMED_QUEUE, TEMP_QUEUE, NAMED_TOPIC, TEMP_TOPIC. It's important to specify the appropriate destination type because the UI will display the names of named queues and named topics and will omit the names of temporary queues and temporary topics. If the library is capable of transmitting CAT headers, an OutboundHeaders object will be provided to the API so that the agent can add CAT headers. Message with CAT headers implementation public class MessageConsumer { @Trace public Message messageReceive() { ExternalParameters messageConsumeParameters = MessageConsumeParameters.library(\"JMS\") .destinationType(DestinationType.NAMED_QUEUE) .destinationName(message.getJMSDestination()) .inboundHeaders(new InboundWrapper(message)) .build(); NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().reportAsExternal(messageConsumeParameters); return message; } } Copy Datastore API When a traced method is reported as an external datastore call, the call is shown in the APM Databases page. Because datastores are external to the running application, the method is reported as datastore activity using the reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters params) method. The only difference is that a different builder, DatastoreParameters, is used to create the appropriate ExternalParameters object. Datastore API implementation TracedMethod tracedMethod = NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod(); tracedMethod.reportAsExternal( DatastoreParameters .product(\"sqlite\") // the datastore vendor .collection(\"test.db\") // the name of the collection (or table for SQL databases) .operation(\"select\") // the operation being performed, e.g. \"SELECT\" or \"UPDATE\" for SQL databases .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) // the datastore instance information - generally can be found as part of the connection .databaseName(\"test.db\") // may be null, indicating no keyspace for the command .build()); Copy Datastore API: Slow query This API call provides the same behavior as the Datastore API call and extends it to allow slow query information to be tracked. The same reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters params) method and builder are used, but with an additional builder method. Datastore with slow query implementation Creating the appropriate ExternalParameters object is illustrated below: //Reporting a method as doing datastore activity TracedMethod tracedMethod = NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod(); tracedMethod.reportAsExternal( DatastoreParameters .product(\"sqlite\") // the datastore vendor .collection(\"test.db\") // the name of the collection (or table for SQL databases) .operation(\"select\") // the operation being performed, e.g. \"SELECT\" or \"UPDATE\" for SQL databases .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) // the datastore instance information - generally can be found as part of the connection .databaseName(\"test.db\") // may be null, indicating no keyspace for the command .slowQuery(rawQuery,QUERY_CONVERTER) .build()); private static QueryConverter<String> QUERY_CONVERTER = new QueryConverter<String>() { @Override public String toRawQueryString(String statement) { // Do work to transform raw query object to string return statement; } @Override public String toObfuscatedQueryString(String statement) { // Do work to remove any sensitive information here return obfuscateQuery(statement); } }; Copy WebFrameworks API The WebFrameworks API allows the agent to report additional identifying information about the application. // Set the dispatcher name and version which is reported to APM. // The dispatcherName is intended to represent the type of server that this // application is running on such as: Tomcat, Jetty, Netty, etc. NewRelic.setServerInfo(String dispatcherName, String version) // Set the app server port which is reported to APM. NewRelic.setAppServerPort(int port) // Set the instance name in the environment. // A single host:port may support multiple JVM instances. // The instance name is intended to help identify a specific JVM instance. NewRelic.setInstanceName(String instanceName) Copy Tip These values can be set only once. Subsequent calls will have no effect. WebFrameworks API implementation public NewRelicApiClient() throws IOException, URISyntaxException { super(8080); // Set Dispatcher name and version. NewRelic.setServerInfo(\"NanoHttp\", \"2.3.1\"); // Set Appserver port for jvm identification NewRelic.setAppServerPort(8080); // Set JVM instance name NewRelic.setInstanceName(\"Client:8080\"); start(NanoHTTPD.SOCKET_READ_TIMEOUT, false); System.out.println(\"\\nRunning on http://localhost:8080/ \\n\"); } Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: New Relic Java agent API Javadoc (detailed API documentation on GitHub) Java agent API example (example application using custom instrumentation for cross application tracing and external datastore calls) Java agent API guide (goal-driven guide to using the Java agent API) Java instrumentation by annotation (how to use annotations to instrument your application code)",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

It also records the userId as a custom parameter on the transaction so that it appears in the parameter details of a transaction trace. (Page load timing sometimes is referred to as real user monitoring or RUM.) String userId = req.getParameter(\"userId\"); if (userId != null) { // set the user name to associate with the RUM JavaScript footer // for the current web transaction NewRelic.setUserName(userId); // add a key/value pair to the current transaction NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); } Copy Collect promotion data This part of the API call records the number of times a promotion was viewed so that the metrics can appear on a custom dashboard.

      "body": "New Relic's Java agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. One of those options is adding the Java agent API's @Trace annotations to your application code. This document describes how to use annotations. Important To use annotations, you must modify the source code. If you can't or don't want to modify your source code, see Custom instrumentation for other instrumentation options. Configure your agent for annotations By default, the configuration setting enable_custom_tracing is set to true in the Java agent, which is the setting required for @Trace annotations to function. This setting is not included in the newrelic.yml by default. The only time you need to incorporate this setting into your configuration file is if you want to disable @Trace annotations altogether. To do this, set enable_custom_tracing: false (prefaced with two spaces) in the common stanza of your newrelic.yml. To detect custom traces: Make sure that newrelic-api.jar appears in your classpath. Add @Trace annotations to your code. In each class containing a method you want to instrument, call: import com.newrelic.api.agent.Trace; Copy Place the @Trace annotation on each target method. Tip The annotation com.newrelic.api.agent.Trace is located in the newrelic-api.jar. Create a new transaction If transactions do not appear and you want to start a new transaction, include dispatcher=true with the @Trace annotation: @Trace (dispatcher=true) public void run() { // background task } Copy Add detail to your transactions If your transaction traces show large blocks of uninstrumented time and you want to include some more methods within the trace, you can use the @Trace annotation without parameters: @Trace protected void methodWithinTransaction() { // work } Copy Convert a transaction to a web request To make a background task report as a web browser transaction with a Java agent API call: In the method annotated with @Trace(dispatcher=true), call: NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(Request request, Response response) Copy The arguments are implementations of the Request and Response interfaces in newrelic-api.jar. Important Even if your Request and Response objects already are present, you still need to add this API call. Define your own @Trace annotation class If you define your own @Trace annotation class, there is no dependency on the newrelic-api.jar. To define the class: package com.test; @Target(ElementType.METHOD) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) public @interface Trace { public static final String NULL = \"\"; String metricName() default NULL; boolean dispatcher() default false; String tracerFactoryName() default NULL; } Copy Then, configure the agent to use this annotation in the common section of the newrelic.yml: class_transformer: trace_annotation_class_name: com.test.Trace Copy Properties for @Trace The @Trace annotation supports the following properties. dispatcher Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent will start a transaction when it reaches a method with this @Trace annotation if a transaction is not already in progress. If a transaction is already in progress, the method with this annotation will be included in the ongoing transaction, rather than starting a new one. If false (default), no metrics will be recorded if the agent has not started a transaction before the @Trace annotation is reached. For example: @Trace(dispatcher=true) Copy async Type: Boolean Default: false If true, this method is marked as asynchronous and the agent will trace this method if it linked to an existing transaction. For example: @Trace(async=true) Copy If false (default), the method is not marked as asynchronous. If other @Trace annotations are present and the method is not executing asynchronously, it will still be traced. metricName Type: String Default: (none) This property affects transaction traces and error reporting. By default, the metric name will include the class name followed by the method name. If you do not want class followed by method, then you can use this property to change the metric name. If you set the metricName, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\"), then the time spent in this method will appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. If you set the metricName in addition to the dispatcher, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\", dispatcher=true), then the transaction name will appear as YourMessageHere in the APM Transactions page but the time spent in this method will not appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. Here is an example: @Trace(metricName=\"YourMetricName\") Copy Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. excludeFromTransactionTrace Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the method will be excluded from the transaction trace. The agent will still collect metrics for the method. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true) Copy leaf Type: Boolean Default: false A leaf tracer has no child tracers. This is useful when you want all time attributed to the tracer, even if other trace points are encountered the tracer's execution. Database tracers often act as a leaf so that all time is attributed to database activity, even if instrumented external calls are made. Here is an example: @Trace(leaf=true) Copy If a leaf tracer does not participate in transaction traces, the agent can create a tracer with lower overhead. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true, leaf=true) Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction.",

Verify your instrumentation The API has a number of built-in safety mechanisms to prevent issues caused by incorrect API usage, but you can use these techniques to verify that your application’s instrumentation is correct: After instrumenting your code, verify that the logs show that an equal number of tokens have been created and expired. For more information on which log messages to look for, see Use logs to troubleshoot. Check the garbage collection statistics under APM's JVMs page to determine whether or not your changes have significantly altered garbage collection patterns. Check if any segments or tokens are timing out by reviewing your transaction traces for a timed_out attribute. If so, you can change the limit with token_timeout and segment_timeout. Use logs to troubleshoot To customize your Java agent logging, see Generating logs. Then, you can examine your logs for these common messages: To view created tokens, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: created active token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view expired tokens and the time that they expired, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: expired token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view created segments, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04: startSegment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 created and started with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy To view ended segments and the time that they ended, check logs at FINEST for: com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04--finish segment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 async finish with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy Problem: Transaction times are too long Make sure to expire tokens and end or ignore segments; otherwise transactions may take longer to report to New Relic. The Java agent has a timeout mechanism for tokens and segments that are not ended correctly. For more information, see token_timeout and segment_timeout. Problem: No transaction trace data Inspect transaction traces to make sure expected asynchronous work is reported. If you do not see any transaction traces, make sure your transaction duration exceeds the transaction trace threshold set in transaction_threshold. Problem: Too few async calls If too few calls are being reported: Ensure that each activity you monitor is appropriately linked In the faulty example below, a parallel stream is being used, which means that the work done inside the lambda in the call to map() can be scheduled on a different thread than the thread handling the request. Without creating a token to link all this work together, you will not see any of the work that gets scheduled on a different thread inside of your transaction. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(i -> requestItem(i)) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad\", results); } Copy Check if you are missing required annotations The example below will report only a subset of the calls to requestItem() because it is impossible to put @Trace(async = true) around blocks of anonymous work inside the call to map(). Instead, you should pass the token into requestItem() and link it, and then add @Trace(async=true) around it. Or use a helper function like requestItemAsync() to do this without changing your existing methods. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad2\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad2(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> { token.link(); return requestItem(id); }) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad2\", results); } Copy Compare this to the correct example below, in which the lambda expression is wrapped by the wrapper class InstrumentedCallable. This class accepts a token and a lambda, then wraps asynchronous work in @Trace(async = true) and uses a token to link the work to the request thread. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_wrap\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamWrap(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> InstrumentedCallable.instrumentCallable(token, () -> requestItem(id))) .map(c -> c.call()) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire(); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_wrap\", results); } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic for Java (agent version 3.37 or higher) includes an API to instrument asynchronous activity. For supported frameworks, the agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, the async API can still be useful to add detail. This document provides examples of using tokens and segments to instrument your app. For more information about how New Relic instruments and displays async work in the APM UI, see Monitoring considerations for asynchronous applications. For details on the actual classes and methods, see the Javadoc. For general information on the Java agent API, see the Java agent API guide. For troubleshooting common problems, see Troubleshooting Java asynchronous applications. Async tracking tools: Tokens and segments The Java agent API provides two ways to trace asynchronous activity: Tokens: Tokens are passed between threads to link asynchronous units of work to a specific transaction. They do not perform any timing directly. Segments: Segments are used to measure an arbitrary piece of asynchronous application code, not necessarily associated with a method or thread. Segments are typically used to track external calls that are completed by a callback mechanism. Tokens: Connect async threads Use tokens to link arbitrary units of work that are on separate threads. This section describes how to use the token-related calls together to instrument async work. For detailed information on classes and methods, see the Javadoc. To use tokens, you first need to create the token, then link another call to the originating transaction. You should link the token as soon as possible within the other call. If you do not link the token immediately, you risk losing any methods that contain an @Trace below the call you are trying to link. You can also expire the token in the original call. The Java agent will then link the work in the New Relic UI. These examples illustrate how to use the token-related calls together: 1. Start a transaction, then create and expire a token Consider the method parallelStream() in the code snippet below. Because some of the calls to requestItemAsync() will occur on a separate thread, a token is created and passed to link that asynchronous work back to the requesting thread. /** * Example showing multi-threaded implementation of requesting data using a parallel {@link Stream}. */ @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) // starts a transaction public ResponseEntity<String> parallelStream(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<Long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). getToken() ; List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> requestItemAsync\\(id, token)) // note we're calling a different method than parallelStreamBad .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire() ; return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream\", results); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: @Trace(dispatcher = true): Tells the agent to start a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. getToken(): Creates the token which will link the work together. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. token.expire(): Expires the token. This allows the transaction to end. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 2. Mark a transaction as async and link to request thread The following code example shows requestItemAsync, which might execute on a separate thread from the requesting thread. For this reason, the token that was created in the previous code example is linked to the Transaction in requestItemAsync. Note that requestItemAsync() has the @Trace(async=true) annotation, which tells the agent to trace this method if it's linked to an existing transaction. After parallelStream() collects all results, the token is expired. This is important because it makes sure the transaction doesn't stay open after parallelStream() completes. @Trace(async = true) private Item requestItemAsync(long id, Token token) { token.link() ; return requestItem(id); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: @Trace(async = true): Starts a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. token.link(): Links the work being done in requestItemAsync() (which is executing on a different thread) to the requesting thread. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 3. View your async trace in the New Relic UI Here's an example of a transaction trace in the APM UI for this endpoint: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: All asynchronous method calls linked with a token are indicated with an Async icon. All asynchronous method calls linked with a token are indicated with an Async icon in the Drilldown column. It's not necessary to link methods that are on the same thread, but doing so will have no negative effect. It's often the case that a single token can be shared, like in the parallelStream() example. Tip By default, a transaction can create a maximum of 3000 tokens and each token has a default timeout of 180s. You can change the former limit with the token_limit config option and the latter with the token_timeout config option. Traces for transactions that exceed the token_limit will contain a token_clamp attribute. Increasing either config option may increase agent memory usage. Segments: Time arbitrary async activity Segments are used to measure an arbitrary piece of asynchronous application code, not necessarily associated with a method or thread. This is most commonly used to time connections to external services. Use segments if you want to: Time code that completes via a callback Time an asynchronous call that spans many methods Measure the time between when work is created and when it executed (for example, in a thread pool) 1. Create a transaction and call an external service The method below makes a call to an external service (in this case a database) using the method storeItem(): /** * Example showing single threaded implementation of inserting data into a datasource. */ @RequestMapping(\"insert\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) //starts a transaction public ResponseEntity insert(@RequestParam(\"id\") Long id) { if (id != null) { storeItem(id); return new ResponseEntity<>(\"insert\", HttpStatus.OK); } else { return new ResponseEntity<>(\"insert\", HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); } } Copy The goal in this case it to find out how long the Callable in the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool before executing, rather than determining how long storeItem() runs. For this reason, a segment is used instead of a token, and @Trace(async = true) is not necessary like it was for a token. The agent API call in this sample is: @Trace(dispatcher = true): Starts a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 2. Start a segment, report externals, and end the segment The following code example shows a segment starting in the storeItem method to measure how long the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool. To stop timing the segment, you must call either .end() or .ignore(). If you don't want to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .ignore(). Otherwise, to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .end(). private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal (DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()); // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end(); insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 3. View your async trace in the New Relic UI When the method completes, APM displays a transaction trace with one external call: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: A single asynchronous segment is called out in the Drilldown column. Tip By default, the agent can track a maximum of 1000 segments during a given transaction. You can change this limit with the segment_timeout config option. Traces of transactions that exceed this limit will contain a segment_clamp attribute. Increasing this limit may increase agent memory usage.",

      "body": "New Relic for Java includes a set of API methods for custom instrumentation of asynchronous activity. This is most useful to instrument asynchronous activity in unsupported frameworks, but you can also use the API to add additional instrumentation to supported frameworks. This document explains how asynchronous activity occurs, and how New Relic monitors async work. Asynchronous operations With a synchronous programming model, programming tasks are usually executed in a specific order. One task must complete before the next task begins, and each task blocks the next task from completing. Asynchronous programming uses a non-blocking model, so that tasks can be run in parallel. Tasks executed asynchronously are completely independent of each other in their execution and initialization. Because asynchronous code doesn't execute in a specific order, the server's full processing power can be used more efficiently, and the app's throughput increases. Async and thread-switching For applications that use asynchronous processing, thread-switching is when a program or task switches from one thread to another. Understanding these asynchronous interleavings can help you decide which methods should be instrumented. Here is an example method with a controller that makes external requests in parallel. These requests execute asynchronously, so each request executes independently of each other and getScoreAsync() returns immediately after being called. This allows the requesting thread to continue making requests while getScoreAsync() makes an external call and sends a reply. @ResponseBody @RequestMapping(\"getScores\", method = RequestMethod.Get produces = “text/plain”) public String getCreditScores(@RequestParam(name = \"uids\") uids) { return Arrays.stream(uids.split(\",\")) .parallel() .map(Integer::valueOf) .map(uid -> getScoreAsync(uid)) .collect(Collectors.toList());} Copy Some of these requests will finish before others. Some might even finish after the requesting thread has moved on to other tasks: With New Relic's asynchronous instrumentation, the APM UI flags the work as Async. For example, if the above method were instrumented by New Relic (either automatically or via custom instrumentation), this is what the APM UI would show on the Trace details page: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: When asynchronous activity in a Java application is detected by APM, it is indicated with the Async flag in the Drilldown column. Async and response time Response time is defined as the duration of a transaction from the perspective of the requester. For asynchronous applications, the response time is often less than the total transaction time. This is because the methods don't have to wait for all preceding methods to complete before returning.

Verify your instrumentation The API has a number of built-in safety mechanisms to prevent issues caused by incorrect API usage, but you can use these techniques to verify that your application’s instrumentation is correct: After instrumenting your code, verify that the logs show that an equal number of tokens have been created and expired. For more information on which log messages to look for, see Use logs to troubleshoot. Check the garbage collection statistics under APM's JVMs page to determine whether or not your changes have significantly altered garbage collection patterns. Check if any segments or tokens are timing out by reviewing your transaction traces for a timed_out attribute. If so, you can change the limit with token_timeout and segment_timeout. Use logs to troubleshoot To customize your Java agent logging, see Generating logs. Then, you can examine your logs for these common messages: To view created tokens, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: created active token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view expired tokens and the time that they expired, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: expired token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view created segments, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04: startSegment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 created and started with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy To view ended segments and the time that they ended, check logs at FINEST for: com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04--finish segment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 async finish with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy Problem: Transaction times are too long Make sure to expire tokens and end or ignore segments; otherwise transactions may take longer to report to New Relic. The Java agent has a timeout mechanism for tokens and segments that are not ended correctly. For more information, see token_timeout and segment_timeout. Problem: No transaction trace data Inspect transaction traces to make sure expected asynchronous work is reported. If you do not see any transaction traces, make sure your transaction duration exceeds the transaction trace threshold set in transaction_threshold. Problem: Too few async calls If too few calls are being reported: Ensure that each activity you monitor is appropriately linked In the faulty example below, a parallel stream is being used, which means that the work done inside the lambda in the call to map() can be scheduled on a different thread than the thread handling the request. Without creating a token to link all this work together, you will not see any of the work that gets scheduled on a different thread inside of your transaction. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(i -> requestItem(i)) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad\", results); } Copy Check if you are missing required annotations The example below will report only a subset of the calls to requestItem() because it is impossible to put @Trace(async = true) around blocks of anonymous work inside the call to map(). Instead, you should pass the token into requestItem() and link it, and then add @Trace(async=true) around it. Or use a helper function like requestItemAsync() to do this without changing your existing methods. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad2\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad2(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> { token.link(); return requestItem(id); }) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad2\", results); } Copy Compare this to the correct example below, in which the lambda expression is wrapped by the wrapper class InstrumentedCallable. This class accepts a token and a lambda, then wraps asynchronous work in @Trace(async = true) and uses a token to link the work to the request thread. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_wrap\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamWrap(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> InstrumentedCallable.instrumentCallable(token, () -> requestItem(id))) .map(c -> c.call()) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire(); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_wrap\", results); } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic for Java (agent version 3.37 or higher) includes an API to instrument asynchronous activity. For supported frameworks, the agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, the async API can still be useful to add detail. This document provides examples of using tokens and segments to instrument your app. For more information about how New Relic instruments and displays async work in the APM UI, see Monitoring considerations for asynchronous applications. For details on the actual classes and methods, see the Javadoc. For general information on the Java agent API, see the Java agent API guide. For troubleshooting common problems, see Troubleshooting Java asynchronous applications. Async tracking tools: Tokens and segments The Java agent API provides two ways to trace asynchronous activity: Tokens: Tokens are passed between threads to link asynchronous units of work to a specific transaction. They do not perform any timing directly. Segments: Segments are used to measure an arbitrary piece of asynchronous application code, not necessarily associated with a method or thread. Segments are typically used to track external calls that are completed by a callback mechanism. Tokens: Connect async threads Use tokens to link arbitrary units of work that are on separate threads. This section describes how to use the token-related calls together to instrument async work. For detailed information on classes and methods, see the Javadoc. To use tokens, you first need to create the token, then link another call to the originating transaction. You should link the token as soon as possible within the other call. If you do not link the token immediately, you risk losing any methods that contain an @Trace below the call you are trying to link. You can also expire the token in the original call. The Java agent will then link the work in the New Relic UI. These examples illustrate how to use the token-related calls together: 1. Start a transaction, then create and expire a token Consider the method parallelStream() in the code snippet below. Because some of the calls to requestItemAsync() will occur on a separate thread, a token is created and passed to link that asynchronous work back to the requesting thread. /** * Example showing multi-threaded implementation of requesting data using a parallel {@link Stream}. */ @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) // starts a transaction public ResponseEntity<String> parallelStream(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<Long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). getToken() ; List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> requestItemAsync\\(id, token)) // note we're calling a different method than parallelStreamBad .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire() ; return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream\", results); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: @Trace(dispatcher = true): Tells the agent to start a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. getToken(): Creates the token which will link the work together. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. token.expire(): Expires the token. This allows the transaction to end. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 2. Mark a transaction as async and link to request thread The following code example shows requestItemAsync, which might execute on a separate thread from the requesting thread. For this reason, the token that was created in the previous code example is linked to the Transaction in requestItemAsync. Note that requestItemAsync() has the @Trace(async=true) annotation, which tells the agent to trace this method if it's linked to an existing transaction. After parallelStream() collects all results, the token is expired. This is important because it makes sure the transaction doesn't stay open after parallelStream() completes. @Trace(async = true) private Item requestItemAsync(long id, Token token) { token.link() ; return requestItem(id); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: @Trace(async = true): Starts a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. token.link(): Links the work being done in requestItemAsync() (which is executing on a different thread) to the requesting thread. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 3. View your async trace in the New Relic UI Here's an example of a transaction trace in the APM UI for this endpoint: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: All asynchronous method calls linked with a token are indicated with an Async icon. All asynchronous method calls linked with a token are indicated with an Async icon in the Drilldown column. It's not necessary to link methods that are on the same thread, but doing so will have no negative effect. It's often the case that a single token can be shared, like in the parallelStream() example. Tip By default, a transaction can create a maximum of 3000 tokens and each token has a default timeout of 180s. You can change the former limit with the token_limit config option and the latter with the token_timeout config option. Traces for transactions that exceed the token_limit will contain a token_clamp attribute. Increasing either config option may increase agent memory usage. Segments: Time arbitrary async activity Segments are used to measure an arbitrary piece of asynchronous application code, not necessarily associated with a method or thread. This is most commonly used to time connections to external services. Use segments if you want to: Time code that completes via a callback Time an asynchronous call that spans many methods Measure the time between when work is created and when it executed (for example, in a thread pool) 1. Create a transaction and call an external service The method below makes a call to an external service (in this case a database) using the method storeItem(): /** * Example showing single threaded implementation of inserting data into a datasource. */ @RequestMapping(\"insert\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) //starts a transaction public ResponseEntity insert(@RequestParam(\"id\") Long id) { if (id != null) { storeItem(id); return new ResponseEntity<>(\"insert\", HttpStatus.OK); } else { return new ResponseEntity<>(\"insert\", HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); } } Copy The goal in this case it to find out how long the Callable in the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool before executing, rather than determining how long storeItem() runs. For this reason, a segment is used instead of a token, and @Trace(async = true) is not necessary like it was for a token. The agent API call in this sample is: @Trace(dispatcher = true): Starts a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 2. Start a segment, report externals, and end the segment The following code example shows a segment starting in the storeItem method to measure how long the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool. To stop timing the segment, you must call either .end() or .ignore(). If you don't want to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .ignore(). Otherwise, to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .end(). private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal (DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()); // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end(); insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 3. View your async trace in the New Relic UI When the method completes, APM displays a transaction trace with one external call: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: A single asynchronous segment is called out in the Drilldown column. Tip By default, the agent can track a maximum of 1000 segments during a given transaction. You can change this limit with the segment_timeout config option. Traces of transactions that exceed this limit will contain a segment_clamp attribute. Increasing this limit may increase agent memory usage.",

Problem: Too few async calls If too few calls are being reported: Ensure that each activity you monitor is appropriately linked In the faulty example below, a parallel stream is being used, which means that the work done inside the lambda in the call to map() can be scheduled on a different thread than the thread handling the request. Without creating a token to link all this work together, you will not see any of the work that gets scheduled on a different thread inside of your transaction. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(i -> requestItem(i)) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad\", results); } Copy Check if you are missing required annotations The example below will report only a subset of the calls to requestItem() because it is impossible to put @Trace(async = true) around blocks of anonymous work inside the call to map(). Instead, you should pass the token into requestItem() and link it, and then add @Trace(async=true) around it. Or use a helper function like requestItemAsync() to do this without changing your existing methods. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad2\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad2(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> { token.link(); return requestItem(id); }) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad2\", results); } Copy Compare this to the correct example below, in which the lambda expression is wrapped by the wrapper class InstrumentedCallable. This class accepts a token and a lambda, then wraps asynchronous work in @Trace(async = true) and uses a token to link the work to the request thread. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_wrap\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamWrap(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> InstrumentedCallable.instrumentCallable(token, () -> requestItem(id))) .map(c -> c.call()) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire(); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_wrap\", results); } Copy",

This is most useful to instrument asynchronous activity in unsupported frameworks, but you can also use the API to add additional instrumentation to supported frameworks. This document explains how asynchronous activity occurs, and how New Relic monitors async work. Asynchronous operations With a synchronous programming model, programming tasks are usually executed in a specific order. One task must complete before the next task begins, and each task blocks the next task from completing. Asynchronous programming uses a non-blocking model, so that tasks can be run in parallel. Tasks executed asynchronously are completely independent of each other in their execution and initialization. Because asynchronous code doesn't execute in a specific order, the server's full processing power can be used more efficiently, and the app's throughput increases. Async and thread-switching For applications that use asynchronous processing, thread-switching is when a program or task switches from one thread to another. Understanding these asynchronous interleavings can help you decide which methods should be instrumented. Here is an example method with a controller that makes external requests in parallel. These requests execute asynchronously, so each request executes independently of each other and getScoreAsync() returns immediately after being called. This allows the requesting thread to continue making requests while getScoreAsync() makes an external call and sends a reply. @ResponseBody @RequestMapping(\"getScores\", method = RequestMethod.Get produces = “text/plain”) public String getCreditScores(@RequestParam(name = \"uids\") uids) { return Arrays.stream(uids.split(\",\")) .parallel() .map(Integer::valueOf) .map(uid -> getScoreAsync(uid)) .collect(Collectors.toList());} Copy Some of these requests will finish before others. Some might even finish after the requesting thread has moved on to other tasks: With New Relic's asynchronous instrumentation, the APM UI flags the work as Async. For example, if the above method were instrumented by New Relic (either automatically or via custom instrumentation), this is what the APM UI would show on the Trace details page: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: When asynchronous activity in a Java application is detected by APM, it is indicated with the Async flag in the Drilldown column. Async and response time Response time is defined as the duration of a transaction from the perspective of the requester. For asynchronous applications, the response time is often less than the total transaction time. This is because the methods don't have to wait for all preceding methods to complete before returning. Because tasks can be deferred, the application can take advantage of its limited resources and process things more quickly. The chart's response time line gives you more insight into the perceived behavior and speed of your application than does the total web transaction time: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary: On the APM Summary page, asynchronous activity in a Java app can result in the response time (the blue line) being less than the total transaction time.

      "body": "New Relic for Java (agent version 3.37 or higher) includes an API to instrument asynchronous activity. For supported frameworks, the agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, the async API can still be useful to add detail. This document provides examples of using tokens and segments to instrument your app. For more information about how New Relic instruments and displays async work in the APM UI, see Monitoring considerations for asynchronous applications. For details on the actual classes and methods, see the Javadoc. For general information on the Java agent API, see the Java agent API guide. For troubleshooting common problems, see Troubleshooting Java asynchronous applications. Async tracking tools: Tokens and segments The Java agent API provides two ways to trace asynchronous activity: Tokens: Tokens are passed between threads to link asynchronous units of work to a specific transaction. They do not perform any timing directly. Segments: Segments are used to measure an arbitrary piece of asynchronous application code, not necessarily associated with a method or thread. Segments are typically used to track external calls that are completed by a callback mechanism. Tokens: Connect async threads Use tokens to link arbitrary units of work that are on separate threads. This section describes how to use the token-related calls together to instrument async work. For detailed information on classes and methods, see the Javadoc. To use tokens, you first need to create the token, then link another call to the originating transaction. You should link the token as soon as possible within the other call. If you do not link the token immediately, you risk losing any methods that contain an @Trace below the call you are trying to link. You can also expire the token in the original call. The Java agent will then link the work in the New Relic UI. These examples illustrate how to use the token-related calls together: 1. Start a transaction, then create and expire a token Consider the method parallelStream() in the code snippet below. Because some of the calls to requestItemAsync() will occur on a separate thread, a token is created and passed to link that asynchronous work back to the requesting thread. /** * Example showing multi-threaded implementation of requesting data using a parallel {@link Stream}. */ @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) // starts a transaction public ResponseEntity<String> parallelStream(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<Long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). getToken() ; List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> requestItemAsync\\(id, token)) // note we're calling a different method than parallelStreamBad .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire() ; return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream\", results); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: @Trace(dispatcher = true): Tells the agent to start a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. getToken(): Creates the token which will link the work together. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. token.expire(): Expires the token. This allows the transaction to end. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 2. Mark a transaction as async and link to request thread The following code example shows requestItemAsync, which might execute on a separate thread from the requesting thread. For this reason, the token that was created in the previous code example is linked to the Transaction in requestItemAsync. Note that requestItemAsync() has the @Trace(async=true) annotation, which tells the agent to trace this method if it's linked to an existing transaction. After parallelStream() collects all results, the token is expired. This is important because it makes sure the transaction doesn't stay open after parallelStream() completes. @Trace(async = true) private Item requestItemAsync(long id, Token token) { token.link() ; return requestItem(id); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: @Trace(async = true): Starts a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. token.link(): Links the work being done in requestItemAsync() (which is executing on a different thread) to the requesting thread. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 3. View your async trace in the New Relic UI Here's an example of a transaction trace in the APM UI for this endpoint: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: All asynchronous method calls linked with a token are indicated with an Async icon. All asynchronous method calls linked with a token are indicated with an Async icon in the Drilldown column. It's not necessary to link methods that are on the same thread, but doing so will have no negative effect. It's often the case that a single token can be shared, like in the parallelStream() example. Tip By default, a transaction can create a maximum of 3000 tokens and each token has a default timeout of 180s. You can change the former limit with the token_limit config option and the latter with the token_timeout config option. Traces for transactions that exceed the token_limit will contain a token_clamp attribute. Increasing either config option may increase agent memory usage. Segments: Time arbitrary async activity Segments are used to measure an arbitrary piece of asynchronous application code, not necessarily associated with a method or thread. This is most commonly used to time connections to external services. Use segments if you want to: Time code that completes via a callback Time an asynchronous call that spans many methods Measure the time between when work is created and when it executed (for example, in a thread pool) 1. Create a transaction and call an external service The method below makes a call to an external service (in this case a database) using the method storeItem(): /** * Example showing single threaded implementation of inserting data into a datasource. */ @RequestMapping(\"insert\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) //starts a transaction public ResponseEntity insert(@RequestParam(\"id\") Long id) { if (id != null) { storeItem(id); return new ResponseEntity<>(\"insert\", HttpStatus.OK); } else { return new ResponseEntity<>(\"insert\", HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); } } Copy The goal in this case it to find out how long the Callable in the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool before executing, rather than determining how long storeItem() runs. For this reason, a segment is used instead of a token, and @Trace(async = true) is not necessary like it was for a token. The agent API call in this sample is: @Trace(dispatcher = true): Starts a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 2. Start a segment, report externals, and end the segment The following code example shows a segment starting in the storeItem method to measure how long the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool. To stop timing the segment, you must call either .end() or .ignore(). If you don't want to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .ignore(). Otherwise, to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .end(). private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal (DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()); // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end(); insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 3. View your async trace in the New Relic UI When the method completes, APM displays a transaction trace with one external call: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: A single asynchronous segment is called out in the Drilldown column. Tip By default, the agent can track a maximum of 1000 segments during a given transaction. You can change this limit with the segment_timeout config option. Traces of transactions that exceed this limit will contain a segment_clamp attribute. Increasing this limit may increase agent memory usage.",

The chart's response time line gives you more insight into the perceived behavior and speed of your application than does the total web transaction time: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary: On the APM Summary page, asynchronous activity in a Java app can result in the response time (the blue line) being less than the total transaction time.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "To communicate with the New Relic collector over HTTPS, you need to have the proper certificates for trusted signers in the trust store on your app server. By default, most JREs contain a valid root certificate that allows the agent to connect to newrelic.com. For SSL connection issues, please visit SSL or connection errors (Java). Notice of expired SSL certificates and certificate removal Caution The SSL certificates that were bundled with Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 have expired and are no longer valid. This means that Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 can no longer use the certificates bundled with the agent to establish a connection with New Relic and that you must provide your own SSL certificates. Please see this community forum post for additional details. Important Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2 no longer ship with SSL certificates bundled into the agent. You must provide your own SSL truststore to the agent by explicitly using the ca_bundle_path configuration option, or by using the default truststore provided by the JDK/JRE (the agent will look to use the latter by default). Additionally the use_private_ssl configuration option has been removed from Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Java Agent versions 6.2.0 - 6.4.2 Starting with Java agent version 6.2.0, the use_private_ssl configuration option has been reintroduced so you can use the SSL certificates that are bundled into the agent jar. The following bundled SSL certificates are valid for up to a year after release. META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. When the bundled certificates expire, the Java agent will no longer be able to connect to New Relic and you must either update to the latest agent version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem use_private_ssl: false # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic ... Copy Summary There are two configuration settings that determine what certs are used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. They are: use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path. Here's how they work together: DEFAULT: Neither configuration option (ca_bundle_path/use_private_ssl) is provided, because both are using default values. The agent will use the default SSL certificates bundled into the Java Development Kit (JDK). If these certificates aren't present or don't include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your JDK certificate bundle. Only use_private_ssl is configured. The agent will use the SSL certificates that are bundled with it. Only ca_bundle_path is configured. The agent will try to connect using the custom SSL certificates bundle at the configured path. If the configured custom certificate bundle doesn’t include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your custom certificate bundle. Both use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path are configured. The ca_bundle_path configuration setting takes precedence and the use_private_ssl config is ignored. This behavior is the same as only specifying ca_bundle_path. Java Agent versions 6.0.0/6.1.0 Starting in 6.0.0, the Java agent no longer includes the nrcert global certificate chain. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store must download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Note: In versions 6.1.0+, the Java agent will use a bundled New Relic certificate that is valid for up to a year after release. Before the certificate expires, you must either update the agent to the latest version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic ... Copy Java Agent versions prior to 6.0.0 (Deprecated) For Java agent versions prior to 6.0.0, applications that require valid certificates may add them in one of the following two ways: Use YAML-based configuration. Add the bundled list of New Relic trusted signers to the local store. Using YAML-based configuration The New Relic Java agent bundles the list of trusted signers in the agent newrelic.jar file. If you do not want to change the local trust store, you can activate them by setting use_private_ssl to true in the newrelic.yml agent configuration file: common: default_settings use_private_ssl: true # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic ...

For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent reads its configuration from the newrelic.yml file. By default the agent looks for this file in the directory that contains newrelic.jar. You can override the config file's location by setting the newrelic.config.file system property to a fully qualified file name. Configuration file structure The newrelic.yml file is split into stanzas corresponding to different environments: Test Development Staging Production (default) New Relic applies settings in the common stanza to each of these environments. You can select other environments as the default by setting the newrelic.environment system property to the environment name. Tip A newrelic.yml template is available. If you edit newrelic.yml, be careful to conform to the YAML format. Use a YAML validator to ensure the syntax is accurate before using the file with New Relic's Java agent, and follow these rules: Java agent newrelic.yml Requirements Format YML files are case sensitive. Indentations All indentations must be in increments of two characters. Other indentations will result in an Unable to parse configuration file error upon agent startup. Use the same level of indentation for data in the same stanza of the file. Indent any sub-stanzas by an additional two spaces. Changes to file You must restart your JVM host process for changes to take effect. Exception: Property changes to log_level and audit_mode do not require a restart. Property changes under circuit breaker don't require a restart. Configuration settings precedence To override any setting in the config file, use a system property override. In certain environments, environment variables can also be used to override both the config file and the system properties. The environment variables primarily exist to support Heroku. When used, server-side configuration overrides all other configuration settings. With the Java agent, server-side configuration overrides all other settings. Environment variables override Java system properties. Java properties override user configuration settings in your newrelic.yml file. User settings override the newrelic.yml default settings. Configuring the Java extensions directory The Java agent reads the configuration files on process startup. To identify the directory where the files are located, either create a new or specify an existing extensions directory: Create an extensions directory To create the extensions directory: Navigate to the directory where newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml are located. Create a directory named extensions. In newrelic.yml, check that the property extensions.dir is not set. Specify an existing extensions directory To use an existing Java extensions directory: In your newrelic.yml file, locate the common section. Use the property extensions.dir to specify the location of the file. General configuration settings Set these options in the common stanza. To override any of these options, use a newrelic.config prefixed system property. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Defines the application name used to report data to New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2 use this: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Flag to enable the agent. Use this setting to force the agent to run or not run. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Float Default 1.0 The apdex_t threshold in seconds for the application's Apdex score. For Java agent versions 1.2.008 or higher, the apdex_t value is set in the UI and the value in newrelic.yml is ignored. appserver_port Type Integer Default (none) Number to differentiate JVMs for the same app on the same machine. New Relic uses host/port for uniqueness, so you can distinguish the JVMs by putting a switch like this into the startup arguments for each JVM: -Dnewrelic.config.appserver_port=8081 Copy Once you have used appserver_port to name the JVMs and restart them, you should be able to see them individually in the dropdown and in the profiling interface. Important This is only a change for New Relic; it doesn't actually affect the port on which the host communicates in any way. audit_mode Type Boolean Default false Enables plain text logging of all data sent to New Relic to the agent logfile. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. ca_bundle_path Type String Value Format /path/to/ca/cert/bundle.pem Specifies a path to a custom SSL certificate bundle that will be used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. If your custom SSL certificate bundle doesn't include certificates that are sufficient to connect to New Relic then you'll need to merge the required certs into your custom certificate bundle. use_private_ssl Type Boolean Default false The following SSL certificates are bundled into the agent jar: META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy By default (use_private_ssl: false) the agent will use the SSL certificates bundled into the JDK to establish a secure connection to New Relic or the custom SSL certificates bundle specified by ca_bundle_path. If you want to use the SSL certificates bundled with the agent, set use_private_ssl: true. Note: use_private_ssl will be ignored if ca_bundle_path is set. enable_auto_app_naming Type Boolean Default false Enables the reporting of data separately for each web app. Set to true to enable support for auto app naming. The name of each web app is detected automatically and the agent reports data separately for each one. This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for web apps in New Relic. For more information, see Automatic application naming. For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. enable_auto_transaction_naming Type Boolean Default true Enables component-based transaction naming. Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming. Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction. For more information, see Naming web transactions. Caution Unless you implement API calls to name your transactions, disabling auto-transaction naming is very likely to cause Metric grouping issues. enable_custom_tracing Type Boolean Default true Enables all instrumentation using an @Trace annotation. Disabling this causes @Trace annotations to be ignored. extensions.dir Type String Default (none) Defines the location of the optional extensions directory. If this property is not set, the agent will look for a subdirectory named extensions in the same directory as newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml. high_security Type Boolean Default false In order for high security to be enabled, this property must be set to true and the high security property in the New Relic user interface must be enabled. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request and message queue parameters are not collected, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. insert_api_key Type String Default (none) A valid Insert API Key for your account. This is only required for Real-time Java profiling using JFR metrics. labels Type String Default \"\" Attach tags to this app. Note that this option now enables tags, which replaced the label feature. You can still query your historical labels. max_stack_trace_lines Type Integer Default 30 Limits the number of lines the agent collects from each stack trace. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. proxy_host Type String Default (none) The proxy host through which to connect to the New Relic collector. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_password Type String Default (none) The password for proxy authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. Important The Java agent supports Basic (clear text) authentication. proxy_port Type String Default 8080 The proxy host port number. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_user Type String Default (none) The username for proxy authentication, such as Basic (clear text) authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. proxy_scheme Type String Default (none) The proxy scheme used. Setting proxy_scheme: \"https\" will allow the agent to connect through proxies using the HTTPS scheme. reactor-netty.errors.enabled Type Boolean Default true Whether errors are reported for reactor netty. If set to false, errors will be ignored. Important Only available in Java agent 6.3.0 and above. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default false Enable delayed JVM shutdown to give the agent a chance to send latest metric data to New Relic before JVM shutdown. send_data_on_exit_threshold Type Integer Default 60 The number of seconds after which the agent will use the send_data_on_exit setting. send_environment_info Type Boolean Default true Enable reporting of JVM settings to New Relic. send_jvm_props Type Boolean Default true When set to true, JVM properties will be sent to New Relic. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Requires connections to the New Relic collector to go over SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. This work is done asynchronously to the threads that process your application code, so response times will not be directly affected by this change. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Enable the agent to connect the New Relic collector immediately upon app startup. scala_futures_as_segments Important This applies to Java agent version 3.44.0 or higher. Type Boolean Default false For more concise transaction trace details, the agent does not report Scala Futures as transaction segments, and those Futures do not contribute to the transaction’s total time. Enabling scala_futures_as_segments increases your overhead. If you want Scala Futures to report as transaction segments so you can view them in a transaction trace, you can enable it: scala_futures_as_segments: enabled: true Copy Logging configuration These are part of the general configuration variables. They are broken out here because they are frequently tweaked for debugging. Some of the logging configuration variables are dynamic and do not need a host restart for them to take effect. For instance, if log files are growing too quickly, log_level can be set to a less verbose setting to reduce the reporting rate. Here is the order of precedence for configuration variables affecting log rotation. If log_daily is true, other log rotation settings are ignored. If log_file_count is 1 or 0, the size limit is ignored. Finally, the agent applies log_limit_in_kbytes. Depending on the growth rate, it is possible for the log file size to exceed the configured value by a small amount. log_daily Type Boolean Default false Set to true to roll the logs daily. Overrides the other configuration variables that affect log rotation. log_file_count Type Integer Default 1 The maximum number of log files to keep when using log rotation. log_file_name Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. log_file_path Type String Default logs subdirectory where newrelic.jar is located The log file path. Tip If log_file_path is specified, the directory must already exist. If the default value is used, the agent will attempt to create the directory. log_level Type String Default info The log verbosity level. The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging separate from that of your application. Valid options, in order of verboseness, are: off severe warning info fine finer finest This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. log_limit_in_kbytes Type Integer Default 0 The log file size in kilobytes at which log files are rotated. Set to 0 for no limit. JMX To set these options, use the jmx stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.jmx prefixed system property. The Java agent uses JMX to collect JVM data as well as to communicate with the JFR (Java Flight Recorder) daemon for Real-time Java profiling. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all JMX functionality. linkingMetadataMBean Type Boolean Default false This setting can be enabled to allow the Java agent to expose linking metadata to the JFR daemon. Doing so allows the JFR daemon to obtain the entity GUID generated by the Java agent and link JFR data with the same APM application that is being monitored by the agent instead of as a separate entity. Important This applies to Java agent version 6.1.0 or higher. Attributes To set these options, use the attributes stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.attributes prefixed system property. Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. There is also an attribute stanza under each destination. For more information, see Java agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes and Attribute examples. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. Important For security reasons, capturing custom attributes using the Custom Instrumentation Editor is set to false by default. include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. Transaction tracer These options are set in the transaction_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_tracer prefixed system property. Transaction tracing captures deep information about slow transactions and sends this to the New Relic service. The transaction includes the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true The transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent will capture the EXPLAIN plan for slow queries. Only supported for MySQL and PostgreSQL. explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Threshold in seconds for query execution time below which the slow query and the EXPLAIN plan (if supported) will not be captured. Relevant to slow queries only when record_sql is set to raw or obfuscated. Relevant to EXPLAIN plans only when explain_enabled is set to true. insert_sql_max_length Type Integer Default 2000 The character limit for the SQL query string. If you have many slow SQL queries with large chunks of information, this could negatively affect performance or how quickly you see your data in New Relic. Increase the value gradually until you find the right balance of information and performance. log_sql Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable logging of queries to the agent log file instead of uploading to New Relic. Queries are logged using the record_sql mode. record_sql Type String Default obfuscated When the transaction tracer is on, query statements can optionally be recorded. The recorder has three modes: off: Send no queries. raw: Send the query statement in its original form. obfuscated: Strips out numeric and string literals. stack_based_naming (Play 2.x+ only) Type Boolean Default False Defaulted to true until Java agent version 3.12.1, when it was changed to false. This option is for Play 2.x+ only. Play/Scala instrumentation can use Thread.getStackTrace() to improve tracer naming, but at the cost of increased overhead. stack_trace_threshold Type Integer Default 0.5 Defines a threshold (in seconds) for collecting stack traces from an SQL call. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent will capture the current stack trace. This is useful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Use this setting to control the variety of your transaction traces. top_n is an integer that represents the number of unique, slow transactions that traces will be created for. If you want transaction traces to more accurately reflect the actual slowest transactions in your app, make this value lower. If you want to sample a more diverse array of transactions, make the value higher. A value of 0 would mean that only the slowest transaction is always traced. This is considered not to be optimal, though, because you may have one or two transactions that are always the slowest, and repeatedly seeing those same transaction traces will probably not give you much value. If the same transaction is often the slowest, the top_n setting allows the Java agent (over time) to sample the slowest n transactions. This gives you greater variety and more insight into your application. transaction_threshold Type String (float) Default apdex_f The time threshold used to determine when a transaction is eligible to be traced. When the transaction's response time exceeds this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to New Relic. The default is apdex_f (default), which sets the threshold to be the \"Frustrated\" Apdex level (four times the apdex_t value). You can also set a specific time threshold by entering a float value that represents a number of seconds. slow_query_whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use collect_slow_queries_from. By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy collect_slow_queries_from Type String Default (none) By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this property (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. token_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of Tokens that can be created per Transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. segment_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of segments that can be created per transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. Transaction segments These options are set in the transaction_segments stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_segments prefixed system property. Transaction segments represent discrete pieces of work (generally method calls) and are displayed within transaction traces. Important Transaction segment attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction segments. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction segments regardless on how this property (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction segments, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Browser monitoring These options are set in the browser_monitoring stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.browser_monitoring prefixed system property. Browser monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically inserts API calls in compiled JSPs to inject the monitoring JavaScript into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior. disabled_auto_pages Type Comma-separated list of strings Default (none) When auto_instrument is true, by default all pages are instrumented. List all pages that you want the auto instrumentation to skip here. You can still use manual instrumentation on these pages. For example: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data you can query. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how this property under browser_monitoring is set. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. External tracer The external tracing options are set in the external_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.external_tracer prefixed system property. exclude_request_uri Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to control the collection of outgoing request URIs for errors and transaction traces. Set this to true to disable collecting this information. Cross application tracer The cross application tracing options are set in the cross_application_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.cross_application_tracer prefixed system property. Cross application tracing adds request and response headers to external calls using the Apache HttpClient libraries. This provides better performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents. enabled Type Boolean Default true Cross application tracing is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. Error collector These options are set in the error_collector stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.error_collector prefixed system property. The error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic for viewing. Tip For how to configure errors for the Java agent, including how to configure errors via the UI, see Java agent error configuration. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable error collection. ignore_classes Type Stanza containing a list of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Specified exception class names will be ignored and will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy ignore_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a list of messages per error class Default (none) Specify exception class names the agent should ignore. Ignored messages will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Contains yaml pairs consisting of: A fully qualified exception class name that should not be reported to APM AND A list of exception messages to match against (at least one is required) If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be ignored. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some error message to ignore\" - \"Some other error message to ignore\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different error message to ignore\" Copy ignore_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default 404 A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes that should not be treated as errors. If this property is commented out in the newrelic.yml configuration file, then the 404 status code will automatically be ignored. When using server-side configuration, the status code 404 must be specified in order for it to be ignored. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_status_codes: 404,507-511 Copy expected_classes Type Stanza containing a List of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy expected_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a List of messages per error class Default (none) Contains yaml pairs consisting of a fully qualified exception class name that should be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score and a List of exception messages to match against, the latter of which at least one is required. If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be marked as expected and therefore will affect error rate and Apdex score. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some expected error message\" - \"Some other expected error message\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different expected error message\"​ Copy expected_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default (none) A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes to be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_status_codes: 415,500-506 Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set under error_collector. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. ignore_errors (DEPRECATED) Type Comma-separated list of Strings Default (none) All specified exception class names specified will not be treated as errors. Deprecated as of Java agent 3.40.0 and replaced by ignore_classes. For example: error_collector: ignore_errors: some.other.MyException Copy Strip exceptions These options are set in the strip_exception_messages stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.strip_exception_messages​prefixed system property. This configuration can be enabled to control whether Java exception messages are reported to New Relic. enabled Type Boolean Default false By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you set this to true, the agent strips the messages from exceptions in order to prevent it from inadvertently capturing sensitive information. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages from specific exceptions, add the exceptions to your allow list. whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use allowed_classes. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to the whitelist, separated by a comma. allowed_classes Type String Default (none) If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to allowed_classes, separated by a comma. Thread profiler These options are set in the thread_profiler stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.thread_profiler prefixed system property. Thread profiler measures wall clock time, CPU time, and method call counts in your application's threads as they run. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the thread profiler. Transaction events These options are set in the transaction_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_events prefixed system property. Transaction events provide the data for displaying histograms and percentiles in the UI. Important Previously this stanza was called analytics_events. If your configuration file still uses analytics_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the transaction events service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled transaction events reported every 60 seconds. custom_request_headers Type List of maps Default None Important Unlike other settings, custom_request_headers have to be paired together and must be set in the newrelic.yml file. They can't be overwritten by Java virtual machine arguments (system property) or environment variables. A list of maps with the paired keys header_name and the optional header_alias. Choose one or more custom HTTP request headers to add as transaction attributes. You can list multiple header configurations: transaction_events: custom_request_headers: - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-1\" - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-2\" header_alias: \"CustomHeader2alias\" Copy In the first map set, X-Custom-Header-1 is captured and reported by the agent as the header name for a corresponding value from the request object. The header_name will also be the name of the attribute sent to New Relic. In the second map set, the request header is X-Custom-Header-2, but the CustomHeader2alias is the name sent to New Relic. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set under transaction_events. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events Custom events are set in the custom_insights_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.custom_insights_events prefixed system property. APM lets you record custom event data via the New Relic language agent APIs, which you can then query. Important For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, the following YAML configuration is recognized: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy For agent versions 4.1.0 and above, the YAML configuration uses the nested stanza formatting: custom_insights_events: enabled: false max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true This enables the custom event service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default/Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled custom events reported every 60 seconds. Hostname configuration These options are set in the process_host stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.process_host prefixed system property. These properties are used for configuring the hostname displayed in the UI: display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type String Default 4 If the hostname cannot be determined, then the IP address of the host will be used. This property determines whether the IPv4 or IPv6 address should be used. The default is IPv4. Custom instrumentation These options set in the class_transformer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.class_transformer prefixed system property. trace_annotation_class_name Type String Default (none) String containing the full class name of the annotation class the agent uses to determine which user-specified methods to instrument. For more information about custom annotations, see Java custom metric collection. com.newrelic.instrumentation.servlet-user Type Boolean Default false Enable this option to capture the userPrincipal name. This name is included as a transaction trace attribute, and can be queried. System properties You can override any setting in the newrelic.yml file by setting a system property. The system property corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by newrelic.config. For example, the system property for the log_level setting is newrelic.config.log_level. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the system property for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is newrelic.config.transaction_tracer.enabled. In addition to overriding configuration settings, the following system properties are recognized by the agent: newrelic.config.process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. Requires Java agent 3.17 or higher. newrelic.config.file Type String Default (none) String containing a fully qualified path to the newrelic configuration file. If empty, the agent assumes newrelic.yml is in the same directory as newrelic.jar. newrelic.debug Type Boolean Default (none) Enable debug logging. newrelic.environment Type String Default (none) String containing the environment configuration for the agent to use. newrelic.home Type String Default (none) String containing the home directory of agent. This defaults to the same directory as the agent jarfile. newrelic.logfile Type String Default newrelic_agent.log String containing the name of the agent log file. Environment variables Environment variables take the highest precedence and override the system properties and yml config settings. To set environment variables, use the export VARNAME=value command. To permanently set environment variables, add the export line to a file such as ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile. You can override any setting from a system property or in the newrelic.yml by setting an environment variable. The environment variable corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by NEW_RELIC with all dots (.) and dashes (-) replaced by underscores (_). For example, the environment variable for the log_level setting is NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the environment variable for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED. Important Agent configuration via environment variables requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. For agent versions older than 4.10.0 the following environment variables are available: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains the application name under which to report data to New Relic. Set the name of your application as you want it to appear in New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon ;. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Type String Default false Enables distributed tracing. Case sensitive: use true or false. For more information, see the distributed tracing section. NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains your New Relic account license. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. NEW_RELIC_LOG Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. Cloud platform utilization These options are set in the utilization stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.utilization prefixed system property. The agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances and Docker containers. detect_aws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detect_docker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. Async instrumentation These options are set directly in the common stanza and can be overridden by using a prefixed system property. token_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 180 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically expire an async token that has not been explicitly expired with token.expire(). For usage instructions, see Tokens: Connect async threads. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to unexpired tokens. segment_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 600 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically end a segment that has not been explicitly ended with segment.end() or segment.ignore(). For usage instructions, see Segments: Time arbitrary async activity. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to un-ended segments. Circuit breaker These settings customize the behavior of the Java circuit breaker. These settings are not included in newrelic.yml by default. You do not need to restart your JVM after changing them. If you want to customize the circuit breaker, add the stanza under the common stanza: common: &default_settings​ ​ OTHER_CONFIG_SETTINGS circuitbreaker: enabled: true memory_threshold: 20 gc_cpu_threshold: 10 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true If your application is behaving as expected, you may want to disable the circuit breaker. memory_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 20 Customize the precentage of free heap memory below which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. gc_cpu_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 10 Customize the precentage of garbage collection CPU time above which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. Message tracer These options are set in the message_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.message_tracer prefixed system property. segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Adds message properties to tracer attributes. Set this to false to turn it off. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Java agent version 4.3.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. In the config file, it can be set in the distributed_tracing stanza. It can be overridden using a newrelic.config.distributed_tracing prefixed system property. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy To enable this using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.enabled=true Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. For example, to exclude newrelic headers in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: exclude_newrelic_header: true Copy To exclude newrelic headers using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header=true Copy Infinite Tracing Important Requirements: Java Agent 5.12.1 or higher. Infinite Tracing does not work if enable_auto_app_naming is enabled. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional setting below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default None For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see find or create a Trace Observer. You can configure this via YAML: infinite_tracing: trace_observer: host: YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Copy You can also use the system property newrelic.config.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host or the environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.span_events prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable span event reporting. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this property (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in span_events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Important Span event attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. Jar collector The Java agent collects and information about jars and their versions on the application classpath. Jar collection configuration is set in the jar_collector stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.jar_collector prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable jar collection and reporting. skip_temp_jars Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable collection of temporary jars. Temporary jars are those residing in the directory specified by the system property java.io.tmpdir. jars_per_second Type Integer Default 10 The maximum number of jars to process per second. Must be positive.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "To communicate with the New Relic collector over HTTPS, you need to have the proper certificates for trusted signers in the trust store on your app server. By default, most JREs contain a valid root certificate that allows the agent to connect to newrelic.com. For SSL connection issues, please visit SSL or connection errors (Java). Notice of expired SSL certificates and certificate removal Caution The SSL certificates that were bundled with Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 have expired and are no longer valid. This means that Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 can no longer use the certificates bundled with the agent to establish a connection with New Relic and that you must provide your own SSL certificates. Please see this community forum post for additional details. Important Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2 no longer ship with SSL certificates bundled into the agent. You must provide your own SSL truststore to the agent by explicitly using the ca_bundle_path configuration option, or by using the default truststore provided by the JDK/JRE (the agent will look to use the latter by default). Additionally the use_private_ssl configuration option has been removed from Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Java Agent versions 6.2.0 - 6.4.2 Starting with Java agent version 6.2.0, the use_private_ssl configuration option has been reintroduced so you can use the SSL certificates that are bundled into the agent jar. The following bundled SSL certificates are valid for up to a year after release. META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. When the bundled certificates expire, the Java agent will no longer be able to connect to New Relic and you must either update to the latest agent version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem use_private_ssl: false # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic ... Copy Summary There are two configuration settings that determine what certs are used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. They are: use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path. Here's how they work together: DEFAULT: Neither configuration option (ca_bundle_path/use_private_ssl) is provided, because both are using default values. The agent will use the default SSL certificates bundled into the Java Development Kit (JDK). If these certificates aren't present or don't include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your JDK certificate bundle. Only use_private_ssl is configured. The agent will use the SSL certificates that are bundled with it. Only ca_bundle_path is configured. The agent will try to connect using the custom SSL certificates bundle at the configured path. If the configured custom certificate bundle doesn’t include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your custom certificate bundle. Both use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path are configured. The ca_bundle_path configuration setting takes precedence and the use_private_ssl config is ignored. This behavior is the same as only specifying ca_bundle_path. Java Agent versions 6.0.0/6.1.0 Starting in 6.0.0, the Java agent no longer includes the nrcert global certificate chain. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store must download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Note: In versions 6.1.0+, the Java agent will use a bundled New Relic certificate that is valid for up to a year after release. Before the certificate expires, you must either update the agent to the latest version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

By default, most JREs contain a valid root certificate that allows the agent to connect to newrelic.com. For SSL connection issues, please visit SSL or connection errors (Java). Notice of expired SSL certificates and certificate removal Caution The SSL certificates that were bundled with Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 have expired and are no longer valid. This means that Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 can no longer use the certificates bundled with the agent to establish a connection with New Relic and that you must provide your own SSL certificates. Please see this community forum post for additional details. Important Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2 no longer ship with SSL certificates bundled into the agent. You must provide your own SSL truststore to the agent by explicitly using the ca_bundle_path configuration option, or by using the default truststore provided by the JDK/JRE (the agent will look to use the latter by default). Additionally the use_private_ssl configuration option has been removed from Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Java Agent versions 6.2.0 - 6.4.2 Starting with Java agent version 6.2.0, the use_private_ssl configuration option has been reintroduced so you can use the SSL certificates that are bundled into the agent jar.

Here's how they work together: DEFAULT: Neither configuration option (ca_bundle_path/use_private_ssl) is provided, because both are using default values. The agent will use the default SSL certificates bundled into the Java Development Kit (JDK). If these certificates aren't present or don't include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your JDK certificate bundle.

The agent will try to connect using the custom SSL certificates bundle at the configured path. If the configured custom certificate bundle doesn’t include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your custom certificate bundle. Both use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path are configured. The ca_bundle_path configuration setting takes precedence and the use_private_ssl config is ignored. This behavior is the same as only specifying ca_bundle_path. Java Agent versions 6.0.0/6.1.0 Starting in 6.0.0, the Java agent no longer includes the nrcert global certificate chain. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store must download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Note: In versions 6.1.0+, the Java agent will use a bundled New Relic certificate that is valid for up to a year after release.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "To communicate with the New Relic collector over HTTPS, you need to have the proper certificates for trusted signers in the trust store on your app server. By default, most JREs contain a valid root certificate that allows the agent to connect to newrelic.com. For SSL connection issues, please visit SSL or connection errors (Java). Notice of expired SSL certificates and certificate removal Caution The SSL certificates that were bundled with Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 have expired and are no longer valid. This means that Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 can no longer use the certificates bundled with the agent to establish a connection with New Relic and that you must provide your own SSL certificates. Please see this community forum post for additional details. Important Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2 no longer ship with SSL certificates bundled into the agent. You must provide your own SSL truststore to the agent by explicitly using the ca_bundle_path configuration option, or by using the default truststore provided by the JDK/JRE (the agent will look to use the latter by default). Additionally the use_private_ssl configuration option has been removed from Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Java Agent versions 6.2.0 - 6.4.2 Starting with Java agent version 6.2.0, the use_private_ssl configuration option has been reintroduced so you can use the SSL certificates that are bundled into the agent jar. The following bundled SSL certificates are valid for up to a year after release. META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. When the bundled certificates expire, the Java agent will no longer be able to connect to New Relic and you must either update to the latest agent version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem use_private_ssl: false # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic ... Copy Summary There are two configuration settings that determine what certs are used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. They are: use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path. Here's how they work together: DEFAULT: Neither configuration option (ca_bundle_path/use_private_ssl) is provided, because both are using default values. The agent will use the default SSL certificates bundled into the Java Development Kit (JDK). If these certificates aren't present or don't include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your JDK certificate bundle. Only use_private_ssl is configured. The agent will use the SSL certificates that are bundled with it. Only ca_bundle_path is configured. The agent will try to connect using the custom SSL certificates bundle at the configured path. If the configured custom certificate bundle doesn’t include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your custom certificate bundle. Both use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path are configured. The ca_bundle_path configuration setting takes precedence and the use_private_ssl config is ignored. This behavior is the same as only specifying ca_bundle_path. Java Agent versions 6.0.0/6.1.0 Starting in 6.0.0, the Java agent no longer includes the nrcert global certificate chain. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store must download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Note: In versions 6.1.0+, the Java agent will use a bundled New Relic certificate that is valid for up to a year after release. Before the certificate expires, you must either update the agent to the latest version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic ... Copy Java Agent versions prior to 6.0.0 (Deprecated) For Java agent versions prior to 6.0.0, applications that require valid certificates may add them in one of the following two ways: Use YAML-based configuration. Add the bundled list of New Relic trusted signers to the local store. Using YAML-based configuration The New Relic Java agent bundles the list of trusted signers in the agent newrelic.jar file. If you do not want to change the local trust store, you can activate them by setting use_private_ssl to true in the newrelic.yml agent configuration file: common: default_settings use_private_ssl: true # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic ...

The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "To communicate with the New Relic collector over HTTPS, you need to have the proper certificates for trusted signers in the trust store on your app server. By default, most JREs contain a valid root certificate that allows the agent to connect to newrelic.com. For SSL connection issues, please visit SSL or connection errors (Java). Notice of expired SSL certificates and certificate removal Caution The SSL certificates that were bundled with Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 have expired and are no longer valid. This means that Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 can no longer use the certificates bundled with the agent to establish a connection with New Relic and that you must provide your own SSL certificates. Please see this community forum post for additional details. Important Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2 no longer ship with SSL certificates bundled into the agent. You must provide your own SSL truststore to the agent by explicitly using the ca_bundle_path configuration option, or by using the default truststore provided by the JDK/JRE (the agent will look to use the latter by default). Additionally the use_private_ssl configuration option has been removed from Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Java Agent versions 6.2.0 - 6.4.2 Starting with Java agent version 6.2.0, the use_private_ssl configuration option has been reintroduced so you can use the SSL certificates that are bundled into the agent jar. The following bundled SSL certificates are valid for up to a year after release. META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. When the bundled certificates expire, the Java agent will no longer be able to connect to New Relic and you must either update to the latest agent version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem use_private_ssl: false # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic ... Copy Summary There are two configuration settings that determine what certs are used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. They are: use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path. Here's how they work together: DEFAULT: Neither configuration option (ca_bundle_path/use_private_ssl) is provided, because both are using default values. The agent will use the default SSL certificates bundled into the Java Development Kit (JDK). If these certificates aren't present or don't include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your JDK certificate bundle. Only use_private_ssl is configured. The agent will use the SSL certificates that are bundled with it. Only ca_bundle_path is configured. The agent will try to connect using the custom SSL certificates bundle at the configured path. If the configured custom certificate bundle doesn’t include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your custom certificate bundle. Both use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path are configured. The ca_bundle_path configuration setting takes precedence and the use_private_ssl config is ignored. This behavior is the same as only specifying ca_bundle_path. Java Agent versions 6.0.0/6.1.0 Starting in 6.0.0, the Java agent no longer includes the nrcert global certificate chain. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store must download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Note: In versions 6.1.0+, the Java agent will use a bundled New Relic certificate that is valid for up to a year after release. Before the certificate expires, you must either update the agent to the latest version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic ... Copy Java Agent versions prior to 6.0.0 (Deprecated) For Java agent versions prior to 6.0.0, applications that require valid certificates may add them in one of the following two ways: Use YAML-based configuration. Add the bundled list of New Relic trusted signers to the local store. Using YAML-based configuration The New Relic Java agent bundles the list of trusted signers in the agent newrelic.jar file. If you do not want to change the local trust store, you can activate them by setting use_private_ssl to true in the newrelic.yml agent configuration file: common: default_settings use_private_ssl: true # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic ...

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "To communicate with the New Relic collector over HTTPS, you need to have the proper certificates for trusted signers in the trust store on your app server. By default, most JREs contain a valid root certificate that allows the agent to connect to newrelic.com. For SSL connection issues, please visit SSL or connection errors (Java). Notice of expired SSL certificates and certificate removal Caution The SSL certificates that were bundled with Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 have expired and are no longer valid. This means that Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 can no longer use the certificates bundled with the agent to establish a connection with New Relic and that you must provide your own SSL certificates. Please see this community forum post for additional details. Important Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2 no longer ship with SSL certificates bundled into the agent. You must provide your own SSL truststore to the agent by explicitly using the ca_bundle_path configuration option, or by using the default truststore provided by the JDK/JRE (the agent will look to use the latter by default). Additionally the use_private_ssl configuration option has been removed from Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Java Agent versions 6.2.0 - 6.4.2 Starting with Java agent version 6.2.0, the use_private_ssl configuration option has been reintroduced so you can use the SSL certificates that are bundled into the agent jar. The following bundled SSL certificates are valid for up to a year after release. META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. When the bundled certificates expire, the Java agent will no longer be able to connect to New Relic and you must either update to the latest agent version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem use_private_ssl: false # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic ... Copy Summary There are two configuration settings that determine what certs are used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. They are: use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path. Here's how they work together: DEFAULT: Neither configuration option (ca_bundle_path/use_private_ssl) is provided, because both are using default values. The agent will use the default SSL certificates bundled into the Java Development Kit (JDK). If these certificates aren't present or don't include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your JDK certificate bundle. Only use_private_ssl is configured. The agent will use the SSL certificates that are bundled with it. Only ca_bundle_path is configured. The agent will try to connect using the custom SSL certificates bundle at the configured path. If the configured custom certificate bundle doesn’t include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your custom certificate bundle. Both use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path are configured. The ca_bundle_path configuration setting takes precedence and the use_private_ssl config is ignored. This behavior is the same as only specifying ca_bundle_path. Java Agent versions 6.0.0/6.1.0 Starting in 6.0.0, the Java agent no longer includes the nrcert global certificate chain. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store must download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Note: In versions 6.1.0+, the Java agent will use a bundled New Relic certificate that is valid for up to a year after release. Before the certificate expires, you must either update the agent to the latest version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic ... Copy Java Agent versions prior to 6.0.0 (Deprecated) For Java agent versions prior to 6.0.0, applications that require valid certificates may add them in one of the following two ways: Use YAML-based configuration. Add the bundled list of New Relic trusted signers to the local store. Using YAML-based configuration The New Relic Java agent bundles the list of trusted signers in the agent newrelic.jar file. If you do not want to change the local trust store, you can activate them by setting use_private_ssl to true in the newrelic.yml agent configuration file: common: default_settings use_private_ssl: true # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic ...

This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...)

See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation allows you to instrument parts of your app that are not instrumented automatically. This document describes how to instrument your app by decorating the methods in your app code with attributes. Use the Transaction attribute to create a custom transaction. You can also mark the custom transaction as a web transaction with the attribute's Web property. Use the Trace attribute to add custom instrumentation to methods that are invoked within a preexisting transaction. Requirements and recommendations Requirements include: .NET agent version 6.16.178.0 or higher. You must be willing to modify your source code. If you cannot or do not want to modify your source code, use custom instrumentation via XML. Your project must have a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll (for example, installing the package and placing using NewRelic.Api.Agent; in your code). This package is in the NuGet gallery. The Transaction and Trace attributes must be applied to concrete implementations of methods. They cannot be applied on interfaces or super class method definitions. Transactions called within transactions Methods decorated with the [Transaction] attribute will only create a new transaction when one does not already exist. When a method decorated with [Transaction] is called from within a previously started transaction, it will be treated as the [Trace] attribute instead, and will provide more information about the existing transaction. Example: Calling Transaction in an already-started transaction During the execution of this console application, OuterMethod will be called first and create a new transaction. The InnerMethod is called from within the transaction started by OuterMethod, so it will not create a new transaction. Instead, information about the execution of InnerMethod will be tracked as if the [Trace] attribute had been applied. static void Main(string[] args) { OuterMethod(); } [Transaction] public void OuterMethod() { InnerMethod(); } [Transaction] public void InnerMethod() { } Copy Create a new non-web transaction To start a non-web transaction (also known as a background request) with the Transaction attribute: [Transaction] public void Run() { // your background task } Copy For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Create a new web transaction To tell the agent to mark a non-web task as a web browser transaction, use either of these options: Set the Web property of the Transaction attribute to true. Set the transaction's URI with SetTransactionUri(). [Transaction(Web = true)] public void Run() { var uri = new Uri(\"http://www.mydomain.com/path\"); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.SetTransactionUri(uri); // your web task } Copy When used inside a previously started transaction, this will be treated as a [Trace] attribute. For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Add detail to existing transactions with Trace If your transaction traces show large blocks of un-instrumented time and you want to include additional methods within the trace, you can use the Trace attribute: [Trace] protected void MethodWithinTransaction() { // your app code } Copy Properties for [ Transaction] The Transaction attribute supports the following properties: Web Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent starts a web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. If a transaction is in progress, then that transaction will continue. If false (default), the agent starts a non-web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. For example: [Transaction(Web = true)] Copy Read forum posts about instrumentation For more specific recommendations, check out these posts in our Explorers Hub community: Troubleshoot attribute-based custom instrumentation issues Build custom instrumentation tracer factories from .NET agent log files Use other API functions For more about the .NET agent API and its functionality, see New Relic's .NET agent API guide.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation allows you to instrument parts of your app that are not instrumented automatically. This document describes how to instrument your app by decorating the methods in your app code with attributes. Use the Transaction attribute to create a custom transaction. You can also mark the custom transaction as a web transaction with the attribute's Web property. Use the Trace attribute to add custom instrumentation to methods that are invoked within a preexisting transaction. Requirements and recommendations Requirements include: .NET agent version 6.16.178.0 or higher. You must be willing to modify your source code. If you cannot or do not want to modify your source code, use custom instrumentation via XML. Your project must have a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll (for example, installing the package and placing using NewRelic.Api.Agent; in your code). This package is in the NuGet gallery. The Transaction and Trace attributes must be applied to concrete implementations of methods. They cannot be applied on interfaces or super class method definitions. Transactions called within transactions Methods decorated with the [Transaction] attribute will only create a new transaction when one does not already exist. When a method decorated with [Transaction] is called from within a previously started transaction, it will be treated as the [Trace] attribute instead, and will provide more information about the existing transaction. Example: Calling Transaction in an already-started transaction During the execution of this console application, OuterMethod will be called first and create a new transaction. The InnerMethod is called from within the transaction started by OuterMethod, so it will not create a new transaction. Instead, information about the execution of InnerMethod will be tracked as if the [Trace] attribute had been applied. static void Main(string[] args) { OuterMethod(); } [Transaction] public void OuterMethod() { InnerMethod(); } [Transaction] public void InnerMethod() { } Copy Create a new non-web transaction To start a non-web transaction (also known as a background request) with the Transaction attribute: [Transaction] public void Run() { // your background task } Copy For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Create a new web transaction To tell the agent to mark a non-web task as a web browser transaction, use either of these options: Set the Web property of the Transaction attribute to true. Set the transaction's URI with SetTransactionUri(). [Transaction(Web = true)] public void Run() { var uri = new Uri(\"http://www.mydomain.com/path\"); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.SetTransactionUri(uri); // your web task } Copy When used inside a previously started transaction, this will be treated as a [Trace] attribute. For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Add detail to existing transactions with Trace If your transaction traces show large blocks of un-instrumented time and you want to include additional methods within the trace, you can use the Trace attribute: [Trace] protected void MethodWithinTransaction() { // your app code } Copy Properties for [ Transaction] The Transaction attribute supports the following properties: Web Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent starts a web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. If a transaction is in progress, then that transaction will continue. If false (default), the agent starts a non-web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. For example: [Transaction(Web = true)] Copy Read forum posts about instrumentation For more specific recommendations, check out these posts in our Explorers Hub community: Troubleshoot attribute-based custom instrumentation issues Build custom instrumentation tracer factories from .NET agent log files Use other API functions For more about the .NET agent API and its functionality, see New Relic's .NET agent API guide.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

This document describes how to instrument your app by decorating the methods in your app code with attributes. Use the Transaction attribute to create a custom transaction. You can also mark the custom transaction as a web transaction with the attribute's Web property. Use the Trace attribute to add custom instrumentation to methods that are invoked within a preexisting transaction. Requirements and recommendations Requirements include: .NET agent version 6.16.178.0 or higher. You must be willing to modify your source code. If you cannot or do not want to modify your source code, use custom instrumentation via XML. Your project must have a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll (for example, installing the package and placing using NewRelic.Api.Agent; in your code). This package is in the NuGet gallery. The Transaction and Trace attributes must be applied to concrete implementations of methods. They cannot be applied on interfaces or super class method definitions. Transactions called within transactions Methods decorated with the [Transaction] attribute will only create a new transaction when one does not already exist. When a method decorated with [Transaction] is called from within a previously started transaction, it will be treated as the [Trace] attribute instead, and will provide more information about the existing transaction. Example: Calling Transaction in an already-started transaction During the execution of this console application, OuterMethod will be called first and create a new transaction. The InnerMethod is called from within the transaction started by OuterMethod, so it will not create a new transaction. Instead, information about the execution of InnerMethod will be tracked as if the [Trace] attribute had been applied. static void Main(string[] args) { OuterMethod(); } [Transaction] public void OuterMethod() { InnerMethod(); } [Transaction] public void InnerMethod() { } Copy Create a new non-web transaction To start a non-web transaction (also known as a background request) with the Transaction attribute: [Transaction] public void Run() { // your background task } Copy For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Create a new web transaction To tell the agent to mark a non-web task as a web browser transaction, use either of these options: Set the Web property of the Transaction attribute to true. Set the transaction's URI with SetTransactionUri(). [Transaction(Web = true)] public void Run() { var uri = new Uri(\"http://www.mydomain.com/path\"); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.SetTransactionUri(uri); // your web task } Copy When used inside a previously started transaction, this will be treated as a [Trace] attribute. For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Add detail to existing transactions with Trace If your transaction traces show large blocks of un-instrumented time and you want to include additional methods within the trace, you can use the Trace attribute: [Trace] protected void MethodWithinTransaction() { // your app code } Copy Properties for [ Transaction] The Transaction attribute supports the following properties: Web Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent starts a web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. If a transaction is in progress, then that transaction will continue. If false (default), the agent starts a non-web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. For example: [Transaction(Web = true)] Copy Read forum posts about instrumentation For more specific recommendations, check out these posts in our Explorers Hub community: Troubleshoot attribute-based custom instrumentation issues Build custom instrumentation tracer factories from .NET agent log files Use other API functions For more about the .NET agent API and its functionality, see New Relic's .NET agent API guide.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

For example: [Transaction(Web = true)] Copy Read forum posts about instrumentation For more specific recommendations, check out these posts in our Explorers Hub community: Troubleshoot attribute-based custom instrumentation issues Build custom instrumentation tracer factories from .NET agent log files Use other API functions For more about the .NET agent API and its functionality, see New Relic's .NET agent API guide.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation allows you to instrument parts of your app that are not instrumented automatically. This document describes how to instrument your app by decorating the methods in your app code with attributes. Use the Transaction attribute to create a custom transaction. You can also mark the custom transaction as a web transaction with the attribute's Web property. Use the Trace attribute to add custom instrumentation to methods that are invoked within a preexisting transaction. Requirements and recommendations Requirements include: .NET agent version 6.16.178.0 or higher. You must be willing to modify your source code. If you cannot or do not want to modify your source code, use custom instrumentation via XML. Your project must have a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll (for example, installing the package and placing using NewRelic.Api.Agent; in your code). This package is in the NuGet gallery. The Transaction and Trace attributes must be applied to concrete implementations of methods. They cannot be applied on interfaces or super class method definitions. Transactions called within transactions Methods decorated with the [Transaction] attribute will only create a new transaction when one does not already exist. When a method decorated with [Transaction] is called from within a previously started transaction, it will be treated as the [Trace] attribute instead, and will provide more information about the existing transaction. Example: Calling Transaction in an already-started transaction During the execution of this console application, OuterMethod will be called first and create a new transaction. The InnerMethod is called from within the transaction started by OuterMethod, so it will not create a new transaction. Instead, information about the execution of InnerMethod will be tracked as if the [Trace] attribute had been applied. static void Main(string[] args) { OuterMethod(); } [Transaction] public void OuterMethod() { InnerMethod(); } [Transaction] public void InnerMethod() { } Copy Create a new non-web transaction To start a non-web transaction (also known as a background request) with the Transaction attribute: [Transaction] public void Run() { // your background task } Copy For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Create a new web transaction To tell the agent to mark a non-web task as a web browser transaction, use either of these options: Set the Web property of the Transaction attribute to true. Set the transaction's URI with SetTransactionUri(). [Transaction(Web = true)] public void Run() { var uri = new Uri(\"http://www.mydomain.com/path\"); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.SetTransactionUri(uri); // your web task } Copy When used inside a previously started transaction, this will be treated as a [Trace] attribute. For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Add detail to existing transactions with Trace If your transaction traces show large blocks of un-instrumented time and you want to include additional methods within the trace, you can use the Trace attribute: [Trace] protected void MethodWithinTransaction() { // your app code } Copy Properties for [ Transaction] The Transaction attribute supports the following properties: Web Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent starts a web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. If a transaction is in progress, then that transaction will continue. If false (default), the agent starts a non-web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute.

The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation allows you to instrument parts of your app that are not instrumented automatically. This document describes how to instrument your app by decorating the methods in your app code with attributes. Use the Transaction attribute to create a custom transaction. You can also mark the custom transaction as a web transaction with the attribute's Web property. Use the Trace attribute to add custom instrumentation to methods that are invoked within a preexisting transaction. Requirements and recommendations Requirements include: .NET agent version 6.16.178.0 or higher. You must be willing to modify your source code. If you cannot or do not want to modify your source code, use custom instrumentation via XML. Your project must have a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll (for example, installing the package and placing using NewRelic.Api.Agent; in your code). This package is in the NuGet gallery. The Transaction and Trace attributes must be applied to concrete implementations of methods. They cannot be applied on interfaces or super class method definitions. Transactions called within transactions Methods decorated with the [Transaction] attribute will only create a new transaction when one does not already exist. When a method decorated with [Transaction] is called from within a previously started transaction, it will be treated as the [Trace] attribute instead, and will provide more information about the existing transaction. Example: Calling Transaction in an already-started transaction During the execution of this console application, OuterMethod will be called first and create a new transaction. The InnerMethod is called from within the transaction started by OuterMethod, so it will not create a new transaction. Instead, information about the execution of InnerMethod will be tracked as if the [Trace] attribute had been applied. static void Main(string[] args) { OuterMethod(); } [Transaction] public void OuterMethod() { InnerMethod(); } [Transaction] public void InnerMethod() { } Copy Create a new non-web transaction To start a non-web transaction (also known as a background request) with the Transaction attribute: [Transaction] public void Run() { // your background task } Copy For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Create a new web transaction To tell the agent to mark a non-web task as a web browser transaction, use either of these options: Set the Web property of the Transaction attribute to true. Set the transaction's URI with SetTransactionUri(). [Transaction(Web = true)] public void Run() { var uri = new Uri(\"http://www.mydomain.com/path\"); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.SetTransactionUri(uri); // your web task } Copy When used inside a previously started transaction, this will be treated as a [Trace] attribute. For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Add detail to existing transactions with Trace If your transaction traces show large blocks of un-instrumented time and you want to include additional methods within the trace, you can use the Trace attribute: [Trace] protected void MethodWithinTransaction() { // your app code } Copy Properties for [ Transaction] The Transaction attribute supports the following properties: Web Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent starts a web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. If a transaction is in progress, then that transaction will continue. If false (default), the agent starts a non-web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. For example: [Transaction(Web = true)] Copy Read forum posts about instrumentation For more specific recommendations, check out these posts in our Explorers Hub community: Troubleshoot attribute-based custom instrumentation issues Build custom instrumentation tracer factories from .NET agent log files Use other API functions For more about the .NET agent API and its functionality, see New Relic's .NET agent API guide.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation allows you to instrument parts of your app that are not instrumented automatically. This document describes how to instrument your app by decorating the methods in your app code with attributes. Use the Transaction attribute to create a custom transaction. You can also mark the custom transaction as a web transaction with the attribute's Web property. Use the Trace attribute to add custom instrumentation to methods that are invoked within a preexisting transaction. Requirements and recommendations Requirements include: .NET agent version 6.16.178.0 or higher. You must be willing to modify your source code. If you cannot or do not want to modify your source code, use custom instrumentation via XML. Your project must have a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll (for example, installing the package and placing using NewRelic.Api.Agent; in your code). This package is in the NuGet gallery. The Transaction and Trace attributes must be applied to concrete implementations of methods. They cannot be applied on interfaces or super class method definitions. Transactions called within transactions Methods decorated with the [Transaction] attribute will only create a new transaction when one does not already exist. When a method decorated with [Transaction] is called from within a previously started transaction, it will be treated as the [Trace] attribute instead, and will provide more information about the existing transaction. Example: Calling Transaction in an already-started transaction During the execution of this console application, OuterMethod will be called first and create a new transaction. The InnerMethod is called from within the transaction started by OuterMethod, so it will not create a new transaction. Instead, information about the execution of InnerMethod will be tracked as if the [Trace] attribute had been applied. static void Main(string[] args) { OuterMethod(); } [Transaction] public void OuterMethod() { InnerMethod(); } [Transaction] public void InnerMethod() { } Copy Create a new non-web transaction To start a non-web transaction (also known as a background request) with the Transaction attribute: [Transaction] public void Run() { // your background task } Copy For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Create a new web transaction To tell the agent to mark a non-web task as a web browser transaction, use either of these options: Set the Web property of the Transaction attribute to true. Set the transaction's URI with SetTransactionUri(). [Transaction(Web = true)] public void Run() { var uri = new Uri(\"http://www.mydomain.com/path\"); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.SetTransactionUri(uri); // your web task } Copy When used inside a previously started transaction, this will be treated as a [Trace] attribute. For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Add detail to existing transactions with Trace If your transaction traces show large blocks of un-instrumented time and you want to include additional methods within the trace, you can use the Trace attribute: [Trace] protected void MethodWithinTransaction() { // your app code } Copy Properties for [ Transaction] The Transaction attribute supports the following properties: Web Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent starts a web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. If a transaction is in progress, then that transaction will continue. If false (default), the agent starts a non-web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. For example: [Transaction(Web = true)] Copy Read forum posts about instrumentation For more specific recommendations, check out these posts in our Explorers Hub community: Troubleshoot attribute-based custom instrumentation issues Build custom instrumentation tracer factories from .NET agent log files Use other API functions For more about the .NET agent API and its functionality, see New Relic's .NET agent API guide.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...)

Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation allows you to instrument parts of your app that are not instrumented automatically. This document describes how to instrument your app by decorating the methods in your app code with attributes. Use the Transaction attribute to create a custom transaction. You can also mark the custom transaction as a web transaction with the attribute's Web property. Use the Trace attribute to add custom instrumentation to methods that are invoked within a preexisting transaction. Requirements and recommendations Requirements include: .NET agent version 6.16.178.0 or higher. You must be willing to modify your source code. If you cannot or do not want to modify your source code, use custom instrumentation via XML. Your project must have a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll (for example, installing the package and placing using NewRelic.Api.Agent; in your code). This package is in the NuGet gallery. The Transaction and Trace attributes must be applied to concrete implementations of methods. They cannot be applied on interfaces or super class method definitions. Transactions called within transactions Methods decorated with the [Transaction] attribute will only create a new transaction when one does not already exist. When a method decorated with [Transaction] is called from within a previously started transaction, it will be treated as the [Trace] attribute instead, and will provide more information about the existing transaction. Example: Calling Transaction in an already-started transaction During the execution of this console application, OuterMethod will be called first and create a new transaction. The InnerMethod is called from within the transaction started by OuterMethod, so it will not create a new transaction. Instead, information about the execution of InnerMethod will be tracked as if the [Trace] attribute had been applied. static void Main(string[] args) { OuterMethod(); } [Transaction] public void OuterMethod() { InnerMethod(); } [Transaction] public void InnerMethod() { } Copy Create a new non-web transaction To start a non-web transaction (also known as a background request) with the Transaction attribute: [Transaction] public void Run() { // your background task } Copy For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Create a new web transaction To tell the agent to mark a non-web task as a web browser transaction, use either of these options: Set the Web property of the Transaction attribute to true. Set the transaction's URI with SetTransactionUri(). [Transaction(Web = true)] public void Run() { var uri = new Uri(\"http://www.mydomain.com/path\"); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.SetTransactionUri(uri); // your web task } Copy When used inside a previously started transaction, this will be treated as a [Trace] attribute. For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Add detail to existing transactions with Trace If your transaction traces show large blocks of un-instrumented time and you want to include additional methods within the trace, you can use the Trace attribute: [Trace] protected void MethodWithinTransaction() { // your app code } Copy Properties for [ Transaction] The Transaction attribute supports the following properties: Web Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent starts a web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. If a transaction is in progress, then that transaction will continue. If false (default), the agent starts a non-web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. For example: [Transaction(Web = true)] Copy Read forum posts about instrumentation For more specific recommendations, check out these posts in our Explorers Hub community: Troubleshoot attribute-based custom instrumentation issues Build custom instrumentation tracer factories from .NET agent log files Use other API functions For more about the .NET agent API and its functionality, see New Relic's .NET agent API guide.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation allows you to instrument parts of your app that are not instrumented automatically. This document describes how to instrument your app by decorating the methods in your app code with attributes. Use the Transaction attribute to create a custom transaction. You can also mark the custom transaction as a web transaction with the attribute's Web property. Use the Trace attribute to add custom instrumentation to methods that are invoked within a preexisting transaction. Requirements and recommendations Requirements include: .NET agent version 6.16.178.0 or higher. You must be willing to modify your source code. If you cannot or do not want to modify your source code, use custom instrumentation via XML. Your project must have a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll (for example, installing the package and placing using NewRelic.Api.Agent; in your code). This package is in the NuGet gallery. The Transaction and Trace attributes must be applied to concrete implementations of methods. They cannot be applied on interfaces or super class method definitions. Transactions called within transactions Methods decorated with the [Transaction] attribute will only create a new transaction when one does not already exist. When a method decorated with [Transaction] is called from within a previously started transaction, it will be treated as the [Trace] attribute instead, and will provide more information about the existing transaction. Example: Calling Transaction in an already-started transaction During the execution of this console application, OuterMethod will be called first and create a new transaction. The InnerMethod is called from within the transaction started by OuterMethod, so it will not create a new transaction. Instead, information about the execution of InnerMethod will be tracked as if the [Trace] attribute had been applied. static void Main(string[] args) { OuterMethod(); } [Transaction] public void OuterMethod() { InnerMethod(); } [Transaction] public void InnerMethod() { } Copy Create a new non-web transaction To start a non-web transaction (also known as a background request) with the Transaction attribute: [Transaction] public void Run() { // your background task } Copy For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Create a new web transaction To tell the agent to mark a non-web task as a web browser transaction, use either of these options: Set the Web property of the Transaction attribute to true. Set the transaction's URI with SetTransactionUri(). [Transaction(Web = true)] public void Run() { var uri = new Uri(\"http://www.mydomain.com/path\"); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.SetTransactionUri(uri); // your web task } Copy When used inside a previously started transaction, this will be treated as a [Trace] attribute. For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Add detail to existing transactions with Trace If your transaction traces show large blocks of un-instrumented time and you want to include additional methods within the trace, you can use the Trace attribute: [Trace] protected void MethodWithinTransaction() { // your app code } Copy Properties for [ Transaction] The Transaction attribute supports the following properties: Web Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent starts a web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. If a transaction is in progress, then that transaction will continue. If false (default), the agent starts a non-web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. For example: [Transaction(Web = true)] Copy Read forum posts about instrumentation For more specific recommendations, check out these posts in our Explorers Hub community: Troubleshoot attribute-based custom instrumentation issues Build custom instrumentation tracer factories from .NET agent log files Use other API functions For more about the .NET agent API and its functionality, see New Relic's .NET agent API guide.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

      "body": "With New Relic's real-time profiling for Java using Java Flight Recorder (JFR) metrics, you can run continuous, always-on profiling of your Java code in production environments. The accompanying JVM cluster timeline view provides a fast and intuitive way to diagnose cluster-wide performance problems. For example, you can quickly see how an application’s deployment affects the overall health of the cluster. Find performance bottlenecks Troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in your Java application or service can help you better understand the following: Where you’re wasting resources When an incident occurs What happened during an incident What performance issues led up to an incident To make troubleshooting faster and easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. JFR daemon The New Relic JFR daemon runs as its own Java process and monitors a JVM for JFR events over remote JMX. Using the New Relic Java telemetry SDK as the underlying implementation, the JFR daemon converts JFR events into New Relic telemetry types and reports them to New Relic's metric and event ingest APIs. On startup the JFR daemon checks if the application you are monitoring is also being monitored by the New Relic Java agent. If the Java agent is present, then the daemon will obtain the entity GUID associated with the application. Both the JFR data and the data collected by the agent will then report to the same APM entity. If the the Java agent is not detected, then the daemon will report as a unique entity under the app name that you configured for it. Requirements Requirements include: Java 8 (version 8u262+) or higher for both the JFR daemon process, and the application process An Insights insert API key or an APM license key. JFR daemon jar. Required for flamegraphs, otherwise optional but recommended: Install of New Relic Java agent version 6.1.0 or higher on your JVM. The JFR daemon can run without a Java agent being included, but if the Java agent is present it will combine agent and daemon data into a single APM application. Important Apps running with the JFR daemon should expect the JFR subsystem to use about 150MB of additional memory. Installation The application that you wish to monitor with the JFR daemon must be configured to expose JFR data over remote JMX by adding the following system properties: -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=1099 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false Copy Tip By default, the JFR daemon will connect via JMX to localhost on port 1099 and send data to New Relic's US production metric and event ingest endpoints. Additionally, if you need the JFR daemon to report through a proxy that will require special configuration settings. To configure the JFR daemon's behavior, please see the fully documented configuration options. To use the JFR daemon: Download the latest version of the JFR daemon jar: jfr-daemon-n.n.n.jar. Register an Insert API key or an APM license key for publishing data to New Relic. Required: Assign your key to the INSIGHTS_INSERT_KEY environment variable. If you are using an APM license key then you will also need to set the USE_LICENSE_KEY=true environment variable. Recommended: Set the name of the application being monitored to the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable. If this is not set, then the default app name will be used instead. Start your application and the JFR daemon: java -jar jfr-daemon-n.n.n.jar Copy Optional (but recommended): Include the Java agent: Install Java agent version 6.1.0 or higher to monitor your application. Configure the Java agent to allow it to communicate with the JMX daemon by adding the following configuration to the newrelic.yml configuration file: jmx: enabled: true linkingMetadataMBean: true Copy Tip Enabling linkingMetadataMBean allows the JFR daemon to acquire the entity GUID that was generated by the Java agent for the application. If the entity GUID is successfully acquired, then data collected by the daemon will be reported to the same application as the Java agent. Any name configured for the daemon using NEW_RELIC_APP_NAMEwould be overridden in favor of the name specified by the agent.

Understand JVM cluster behavior over time The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across your entire cluster. This timeline enables quicker troubleshooting and issue detection; for example, at a glance you can see: How a recent deployment affected the rest of the JVM cluster When a JVM restarted How an individual instance was affected by its noisy neighbor To make troubleshooting easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java: The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across the cluster. Each row of the timeline represents a specific JVM over time. Inside each row, a box represents a 5-minute period of that JVM’s life.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

      "body": "You can use New Relic's Java agent to collect and view additional metrics provided by the most common application servers via JMX. The collected metrics vary by app server and include measurements of thread pools, HTTP sessions, and transactions. View JVM metrics Application servers collect and report different metrics, which appear on APM's JVMs page. (For applications using New Relic via Heroku, the JVMs page is named Instances.) At a minimum, each app server collects and reports metric data on memory. For instructions on enabling JMX metrics, refer to your app server's documentation. To view JVM metrics: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > JVMs > (select a JVM). From the selected JVM's Memory page, use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. To view other metrics, select any available tab. Optional: To use the thread profiler to look for bottlenecks in data on executing threads, select Profile this JVM. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > JVMs: Depending on the metrics your app server is reporting, one or more tabs appear on your JVM page. Tabs available by app server This table lists which tabs appear on the JVM page for app servers. If your app server does not report a particular type of metric data, the tab does not appear on your JVM page. App server Memory Thread pools HTTP sessions App server transactions Data sources Glassfish JBoss 5AS JBoss 6AS JBoss 6EAP JBoss 7AS Jetty Resin 3 Resin 4 Tomcat TomEE WebLogic Websphere Liberty Websphere Traditional WildFly Metrics available by tab Here is a summary of the metrics available from the JVM page.

JMX Metric charts Memory Heap memory usage: Each chart shows the used and committed heap space in MB for a given heap. Non-heap memory pool usage for the JVM: The used code cache and used CMS Perm Gen in MB. Garbage collection: The garbage collection CPU time. Class count: The loaded and unloaded class count for the JVM. Threads Thread count: The current number of active threads in the JVM. Thread pool: The active and idle thread count for the pool. On supported app servers, a chart shows each thread pool present in the app server, as well as the ratio of active to maximum thread count for each thread pool. HTTP sessions Session: The active, invalidated by timeout, and invalidated HTTP session counts for the application. On supported app servers, a chart shows each application present in the app server. App server transactions Active transaction: The number of active transactions within the app server's transaction manager. Created transaction: The change in the total number of created transactions per app server. Some app servers separate top level transactions and nested transactions. Finished transaction: The change in the total number of finished transactions per app server. Some app servers separate them by aborted and committed completed transactions. Data sources The metrics for the data source tab vary by app server. For more details, see Data source metrics by app server. For details on WebLogic's data source metrics, see WebLogic JMX metrics. Data source metrics by app server For supported app servers, the agent collects JMX data source metrics. You can view these metrics at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > JVMs > Data sources. To see these metrics, ensure that your data source has been properly configured for JMX monitoring for your app server.

Enable for Spring Boot 2.2 and higher with Tomcat To enable New Relic to access Tomcat JMX metrics when running with Spring Boot 2.2 and higher, the system property server.tomcat.mbeanregistry.enabled must be set to true. See the Spring Boot 2.2 release notes. Enable WebSphere PMI metrics To enable New Relic to access WebSphere PMI metrics, you will need to configure WebSphere to monitor the necessary statistic sets. Enable all statistic sets (recommended) The simplest approach is to enable the collection of all statistic sets: If you are using Java 2 Security, ensure you have granted New Relic proper permissions. From the WebSphere admin console, select Monitoring and Tuning > Performance Monitoring Infrastructure (PMI) > (your server name). Select the Enable Performance Monitoring Infrastructure (PMI) checkbox. In the Currently monitored statistic set section, select All, then save your changes. Enable custom statistic sets (advanced) You can also collect only the PMI metrics that New Relic monitors by default. To collect only some PMI metrics: If you are using Java 2 Security, ensure you have granted New Relic proper permissions. From the WebSphere admin console, select Monitoring and Tuning > Performance Monitoring Infrastructure (PMI) > (selected app server). Select the Enable Performance Monitoring Infrastructure (PMI) checkbox. Select Custom. From the custom statistic set list, enable the following metrics: In the ThreadPool category, select the ActiveCount and PoolSize checkboxes. In the Servlet Session Manager category, select the ActiveCount and LiveCount checkboxes. In the Transaction Manager category, select the CommittedCount, RolledbackCount, and GlobalTimeoutCount checkboxes. From the Messages panel, select Save directly to the master configuration. Collected WebSphere PMI metrics When enabled, New Relic collects the following WebSphere PMI metrics. If you want other PMI metrics besides these to be collected and displayed in New Relic custom dashboards, use JMX instrumentation. stats.ActiveCount WebSphere PMI metrics Details Attribute stats.ActiveCount Object name pattern WebSphere:type=ThreadPool,name=*,process=*,platform=*,node=*,* Copy New Relic metric JmxBuiltIn/ThreadPool/WebContainer/Active Copy Type Simple maximumSize WebSphere PMI metrics Details Attribute maximumSize Object name pattern WebSphere:type=ThreadPool,name=*,process=*,platform=*,node=*,* Copy New Relic metric JmxBuiltIn/ThreadPool/WebContainer/Max Copy Type Simple stats.CommittedCount WebSphere PMI metrics Details Attribute stats.CommittedCount Object name pattern WebSphere:j2eeType=JTAResource,type=TransactionService,name=*,process=*,platform=*,node=*,* Copy New Relic metric JmxBuiltIn/JTA/TransactionService/Committed Copy Type Simple stats.RolledbackCount WebSphere PMI metrics Details Attribute stats.RolledbackCount Object name pattern WebSphere:j2eeType=JTAResource,type=TransactionService,name=*,process=*,platform=*,node=*,* Copy New Relic metric JmxBuiltIn/JTA/TransactionService/Rolled Back Copy Type Simple stats.GlobalTimeoutCount WebSphere PMI metrics Details Attribute stats.GlobalTimeoutCount Object name pattern WebSphere:j2eeType=JTAResource,type=TransactionService,name=*,process=*,platform=*,node=*,* Copy New Relic metric JmxBuiltIn/JTA/TransactionService/Timed Out Copy Type Simple stats.LiveCount WebSphere PMI metrics Details Attribute stats.GlobalTimeoutCount Object name pattern WebSphere:type=SessionManager,name=*,process=*,platform=*,node=*,* Copy New Relic metric JmxBuiltIn/Session/DefaultApplication#DefaultWebApplication.war/Active Copy Type Simple WebLogic JMX metrics In WebLogic, JMX is enabled by default.

Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation allows you to instrument parts of your app that are not instrumented automatically. This document describes how to instrument your app by decorating the methods in your app code with attributes. Use the Transaction attribute to create a custom transaction. You can also mark the custom transaction as a web transaction with the attribute's Web property. Use the Trace attribute to add custom instrumentation to methods that are invoked within a preexisting transaction. Requirements and recommendations Requirements include: .NET agent version 6.16.178.0 or higher. You must be willing to modify your source code. If you cannot or do not want to modify your source code, use custom instrumentation via XML. Your project must have a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll (for example, installing the package and placing using NewRelic.Api.Agent; in your code). This package is in the NuGet gallery. The Transaction and Trace attributes must be applied to concrete implementations of methods. They cannot be applied on interfaces or super class method definitions. Transactions called within transactions Methods decorated with the [Transaction] attribute will only create a new transaction when one does not already exist. When a method decorated with [Transaction] is called from within a previously started transaction, it will be treated as the [Trace] attribute instead, and will provide more information about the existing transaction. Example: Calling Transaction in an already-started transaction During the execution of this console application, OuterMethod will be called first and create a new transaction. The InnerMethod is called from within the transaction started by OuterMethod, so it will not create a new transaction. Instead, information about the execution of InnerMethod will be tracked as if the [Trace] attribute had been applied. static void Main(string[] args) { OuterMethod(); } [Transaction] public void OuterMethod() { InnerMethod(); } [Transaction] public void InnerMethod() { } Copy Create a new non-web transaction To start a non-web transaction (also known as a background request) with the Transaction attribute: [Transaction] public void Run() { // your background task } Copy For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Create a new web transaction To tell the agent to mark a non-web task as a web browser transaction, use either of these options: Set the Web property of the Transaction attribute to true. Set the transaction's URI with SetTransactionUri(). [Transaction(Web = true)] public void Run() { var uri = new Uri(\"http://www.mydomain.com/path\"); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.SetTransactionUri(uri); // your web task } Copy When used inside a previously started transaction, this will be treated as a [Trace] attribute. For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Add detail to existing transactions with Trace If your transaction traces show large blocks of un-instrumented time and you want to include additional methods within the trace, you can use the Trace attribute: [Trace] protected void MethodWithinTransaction() { // your app code } Copy Properties for [ Transaction] The Transaction attribute supports the following properties: Web Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent starts a web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. If a transaction is in progress, then that transaction will continue. If false (default), the agent starts a non-web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. For example: [Transaction(Web = true)] Copy Read forum posts about instrumentation For more specific recommendations, check out these posts in our Explorers Hub community: Troubleshoot attribute-based custom instrumentation issues Build custom instrumentation tracer factories from .NET agent log files Use other API functions For more about the .NET agent API and its functionality, see New Relic's .NET agent API guide.

Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

To request instance-level information from additional datastores, get support at support.newrelic.com. Hosting services You can install the Java agent on a variety of hosting services, including ones not listed below. Here are detailed installation guides for particular hosting services: Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment Heroku Asynchronous instrumentation For supported frameworks, the Java agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, you can use the Java agent API to extend this instrumentation. Other instrumented features EJB Session Beans 3.0 or higher JMX JSP (Java Server Pages) 2.0 to 2.2 Scala 2.9.3 to 2.13.x Connect the agent to other New Relic products The Java agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Java agent automatically injects the Browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling Browser injection, you can view Browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and Browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Java agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. New Relic One dashboards The Java agent sends default events and attributes to dashboards, or you can run NRQL queries in the query builder. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku After you ensure that you meet the requirements, enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku. Caution You must deploy your Java app to Heroku, following the Heroku instructions at least through the Deploy the app step, before you can enable the New Relic agent add-on. Log in to your Heroku account. From the APM Add-On Page, select a subscription plan. Select Install New Relic APM, and then select your target app from the dropdown. Installing the add-on automatically creates a New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. 2. Provide the path to the jar file After you enable the New Relic agent add-on, pass the javaagent flag to the java process and provide the path to the jar file by editing your Procfile. Deploy to Heroku If you deploy to Heroku, the location of the jar file for both Maven and manual configuration is in the app's root folder in a directory called newrelic. Example: web: java -javaagent:/app/newrelic/newrelic.jar -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy Deploy locally If you deploy locally, your jar file might be in a different directory. If it is, replace PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR with the path to the jar file in your local directory. Example: web: java -javaagent:PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy 3. Configure your Heroku environment for New Relic After you provide the path to the jar file, configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, depending on your platform: Maven configuration Give your app a meaningful name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"APP_NAME\" Copy Add your New Relic license key: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"LICENSE_KEY\" Copy In your pom.xml, add the newrelic-agent dependency, substituting X.Y.Z with the latest Java agent version. Recommended: To ensure proper formatting is applied and contents do not contain sensitive information, format the syntax using http://codebeautify.org/xmlviewer. <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.agent.java</groupId> <artifactId>newrelic-java</artifactId> <version>X.Y.Z</version> <scope>provided</scope> <type>zip</type> </dependency> Copy In the <build> element of pom.xml, customize the build so it downloads the agent: <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId> <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId> <version>3.0.2</version> <executions> <execution> <id>unpack-newrelic</id> <phase>package</phase> <goals> <goal>unpack-dependencies</goal> </goals> <configuration> <includeGroupIds>com.newrelic.agent.java</includeGroupIds> <includeArtifactIds>newrelic-java</includeArtifactIds> <overWriteReleases>false</overWriteReleases> <overWriteSnapshots>false</overWriteSnapshots> <overWriteIfNewer>true</overWriteIfNewer> <outputDirectory>${project.basedir}</outputDirectory> <destFileName>newrelic</destFileName> </configuration> </execution> </executions> </plugin> Copy Manual configuration Log in to dashboard.heroku.com.

With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM or Browser. Tip If you use Scala, see Java agent Scala procedures for Heroku. Compatibility and requirements Java 7 or higher Maven 3 or higher (if you are using Maven) Latest New Relic Java agent version 1. Enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku After you ensure that you meet the requirements, enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku. Caution You must deploy your Java app to Heroku, following the Heroku instructions at least through the Deploy the app step, before you can enable the New Relic agent add-on. Log in to your Heroku account. From the APM Add-On Page, select a subscription plan. Select Install New Relic APM, and then select your target app from the dropdown. Installing the add-on automatically creates a New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. 2. Provide the path to the jar file After you enable the New Relic agent add-on, pass the javaagent flag to the java process and provide the path to the jar file by editing your Procfile. Deploy to Heroku If you deploy to Heroku, the location of the jar file for both Maven and manual configuration is in the app's root folder in a directory called newrelic. Example: web: java -javaagent:/app/newrelic/newrelic.jar -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy Deploy locally If you deploy locally, your jar file might be in a different directory. If it is, replace PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR with the path to the jar file in your local directory. Example: web: java -javaagent:PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy 3. Configure your Heroku environment for New Relic After you provide the path to the jar file, configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, depending on your platform: Maven configuration Give your app a meaningful name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"APP_NAME\" Copy Add your New Relic license key: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"LICENSE_KEY\" Copy In your pom.xml, add the newrelic-agent dependency, substituting X.Y.Z with the latest Java agent version. Recommended: To ensure proper formatting is applied and contents do not contain sensitive information, format the syntax using http://codebeautify.org/xmlviewer. <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.agent.java</groupId> <artifactId>newrelic-java</artifactId> <version>X.Y.Z</version> <scope>provided</scope> <type>zip</type> </dependency> Copy In the <build> element of pom.xml, customize the build so it downloads the agent: <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId> <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId> <version>3.0.2</version> <executions> <execution> <id>unpack-newrelic</id> <phase>package</phase> <goals> <goal>unpack-dependencies</goal> </goals> <configuration> <includeGroupIds>com.newrelic.agent.java</includeGroupIds> <includeArtifactIds>newrelic-java</includeArtifactIds> <overWriteReleases>false</overWriteReleases> <overWriteSnapshots>false</overWriteSnapshots> <overWriteIfNewer>true</overWriteIfNewer> <outputDirectory>${project.basedir}</outputDirectory> <destFileName>newrelic</destFileName> </configuration> </execution> </executions> </plugin> Copy Manual configuration Log in to dashboard.heroku.com. Select your app. Select Add-ons > New Relic APM. From the New Relic UI's account dropdown, select Account settings. In the Update your New Relic agent section, download the latest agent release for your Java SE release. Unzip the file into your app root. Edit newrelic.yml to customize the app_name setting with a descriptive app name. Also in newrelic.yml, add your license key to the license_key setting. 4. Push your changes and open the app After you configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, push your changes and open the app to monitor it with New Relic. Push your changes to the dyno with this Heroku toolbelt command: git add . git commit -m 'YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE' git push heroku master Copy Open your app in your browser with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku open Copy Generate some traffic to your app and wait a few minutes. Check your app's performance in Heroku by selecting your app and then selecting the New Relic add-on. If no data appears or if you have problems, follow the troubleshooting tips. Troubleshoot Here are some tips to help you troubleshoot: If you don't see the New Relic add-on after you generate traffic, go to Heroku, select Find More Add Ons, and add the APM add-on. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting procedures for Heroku (Java).

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "To communicate with the New Relic collector over HTTPS, you need to have the proper certificates for trusted signers in the trust store on your app server. By default, most JREs contain a valid root certificate that allows the agent to connect to newrelic.com. For SSL connection issues, please visit SSL or connection errors (Java). Notice of expired SSL certificates and certificate removal Caution The SSL certificates that were bundled with Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 have expired and are no longer valid. This means that Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 can no longer use the certificates bundled with the agent to establish a connection with New Relic and that you must provide your own SSL certificates. Please see this community forum post for additional details. Important Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2 no longer ship with SSL certificates bundled into the agent. You must provide your own SSL truststore to the agent by explicitly using the ca_bundle_path configuration option, or by using the default truststore provided by the JDK/JRE (the agent will look to use the latter by default). Additionally the use_private_ssl configuration option has been removed from Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Java Agent versions 6.2.0 - 6.4.2 Starting with Java agent version 6.2.0, the use_private_ssl configuration option has been reintroduced so you can use the SSL certificates that are bundled into the agent jar. The following bundled SSL certificates are valid for up to a year after release. META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. When the bundled certificates expire, the Java agent will no longer be able to connect to New Relic and you must either update to the latest agent version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem use_private_ssl: false # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic ... Copy Summary There are two configuration settings that determine what certs are used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. They are: use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path. Here's how they work together: DEFAULT: Neither configuration option (ca_bundle_path/use_private_ssl) is provided, because both are using default values. The agent will use the default SSL certificates bundled into the Java Development Kit (JDK). If these certificates aren't present or don't include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your JDK certificate bundle. Only use_private_ssl is configured. The agent will use the SSL certificates that are bundled with it. Only ca_bundle_path is configured. The agent will try to connect using the custom SSL certificates bundle at the configured path. If the configured custom certificate bundle doesn’t include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your custom certificate bundle. Both use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path are configured. The ca_bundle_path configuration setting takes precedence and the use_private_ssl config is ignored. This behavior is the same as only specifying ca_bundle_path. Java Agent versions 6.0.0/6.1.0 Starting in 6.0.0, the Java agent no longer includes the nrcert global certificate chain. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store must download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Note: In versions 6.1.0+, the Java agent will use a bundled New Relic certificate that is valid for up to a year after release. Before the certificate expires, you must either update the agent to the latest version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic ... Copy Java Agent versions prior to 6.0.0 (Deprecated) For Java agent versions prior to 6.0.0, applications that require valid certificates may add them in one of the following two ways: Use YAML-based configuration. Add the bundled list of New Relic trusted signers to the local store. Using YAML-based configuration The New Relic Java agent bundles the list of trusted signers in the agent newrelic.jar file. If you do not want to change the local trust store, you can activate them by setting use_private_ssl to true in the newrelic.yml agent configuration file: common: default_settings use_private_ssl: true # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic ...

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "To take full advantage of New Relic's latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Java agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Java agent release notes. These update procedures describe how to replace some of the current contents of your agent root directory, which contains the New Relic Java agent (newrelic.jar), with newly downloaded contents from the New Relic UI. Update to latest version To identify which version of the Java agent you're currently using, run java -jar newrelic.jar -v. Your Java agent version will be printed to your console. Then, to update to the latest Java agent version: Back up the entire Java agent root directory to another location. Rename that directory to NewRelic_Agent#.#.#, where #.#.# is the agent version number. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings. Download the agent for your platform. Unzip the new agent download file, then copy newrelic-api.jar and newrelic.jar into the original Java agent root directory. Diff your current newrelic.yml with the newly downloaded newrelic.yml from the zip, and update customized differences as needed. Restart your Java dispatcher. If you experience issues after the Java agent update, restore from the backed-up New Relic agent directory. Update agent config differences If differences between the two versions are unrelated to your app's customizations, align the newrelic.yml you use moving forward with the latest updates to the default newrelic.yml from New Relic. For example, if you diff the default newrelic.yml files for Java agent versions 3.29.0 and 3.30.0, the results printed to the console will be: ➜ diff newrelic_3.29.0.yml newrelic_3.30.0.yml 254a255,265 > # Classes loaded by classloaders in this list will not be instrumented. > # This is a useful optimization for runtimes which use classloaders to > # load dynamic classes which the agent would not instrument. > classloader_excludes: > groovy.lang.GroovyClassLoader$InnerLoader, > org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.callsite.CallSiteClassLoader, > com.collaxa.cube.engine.deployment.BPELClassLoader, > org.springframework.data.convert.ClassGeneratingEntityInstantiator$ObjectInstantiatorClassGenerator, > org.mvel2.optimizers.impl.asm.ASMAccessorOptimizer$ContextClassLoader, > gw.internal.gosu.compiler.SingleServingGosuClassLoader, > Copy These lines were added to the default newrelic.yml in Java agent version 3.30.0. If you want to run Java agent version 3.30.0 or higher, ensure you include these lines in your newrelic.yml. Java agent versions not supported End of life notification: As of January 26, 2015, New Relic will no longer accept data from Java agent versions earlier than 3.6.0, except version 2.21.7. These agent versions use an out-of-date protocol when communicating with New Relic's data collection services. In addition, many of these versions contain a potential security issue where they may incorrectly send sensitive data to the New Relic collector. Update unsupported agent versions Important If you are updating from an older agent version, including major version jumps, review the following list for changes in functionality. Migration Comments 5.0.0 Release notes: Java agent 5.0.0 Self installer: The New Relic Java agent's self-installer has been removed in order to provide a more consistent user experience. To install the Java agent, add the full path to the newrelic.jar to the -javaagent flag in your JVM options. For more information, see the documentation on installing the agent on specific application servers, including Docker, Maven, or Gradle. Deprecated instrumentation: The following instrumentation modules have been moved out of the default Java agent. They are now provided as a separate download. To continue using these modules, just add them to the agent's extensions directory in your New Relic folder or wherever your extensions directory is configured. Deprecated modules include: Akka 2.0 Akka 2.1 Akka-http 1.0 Akka-http 2.0 - 2.4.1 Akka-http 2.4.2 - 2.4.4 Hystrix 1.2 Hystrix 1.3 Play 1: Instrumentation for Play-1.x is not available as an extension. Play 2.0 Play 2.1 Play 2.2 Solr 3.1 - 3.4 Solr 3.5 Solr 3.6 4.12.0 Release notes: Java agent 4.12.0 Deprecated APIs: The custom transport channel API is now deprecated in favor of the distributed tracing API. The skipTransactionTrace attribute on the @Trace annotation is now deprecated. Instead, use the excludeFromTransactionTrace attribute. Deprecated instrumentation: JetS3t: Removed built-in instrumentation for JetS3t. The agent will continue to report external calls made with the JetS3t client. 4.4.0 Release notes: Java agent 4.4.0 Java 6 support removed: You must use 4.3 or earlier. EU data center: Minimum version required for use in EU datacenter. Removed the SSL configuration option: SSL is now always used in communication with New Relic servers. The newrelic.yml ssl configuration and -Dnewrelic.config.ssl system property are no longer used. Setting either value to anything other than true will result in logging a warning. Legacy agent 2.21.7 Release notes: Java agent 2.21.7 Java SE 5.0: This is a bugfix release for the legacy Java SE 5.0 version of the agent. Unless you are a Java SE5 user, use the latest version of the New Relic Java agent. This affects: Oracle Hotspot JVM version 5.0 for Linux, Solaris, Windows, OS X Oracle JRockit up to and including 1.6.0_50",

      "body": "This document explains a basic installation of the APM agent for Java applications in a Docker container. We discuss required configurations and also explore some optional configurations, including: How to use identical New Relic configuration files for each container, regardless of the environment where the containers are used How to use the Docker layer when every agent in every environment needs slightly different configuration data How to disable the New Relic agent in some environments and enable it in others Although we don't discuss advanced options here, you can install the Java agent in Docker volumes and use your Docker container image in other software such as Swarm, ECS, AKS, EKS, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. Our Docker examples refer to Tomcat, so if you are using another application server, refer to your vendor’s documentation.

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Get the Java agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this PowerShell command: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip -OutFile newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip: Expand-Archive -Path newrelic-java.zip -DestinationPath DESTINATION_PATH Copy Download from the New Relic UI Complete the following: Log in to New Relic. From the account dropdown in the New Relic UI, select Account settings. In the right sidebar under Most recent, select the Java agent, and save the newrelic-java.zip to a temporary directory. Unzip newrelic-java.zip. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report on any data in your New Relic Account. To copy your license key: Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings. Under Account information, copy the license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

      "body": "APM for Java allows you to use an Ansible role for installation and configuration. Compatibility and requirements New Relic's Ansible role for the Java agent is open source and community-supported. It supports setting up our Java agent to instrument applications running under Tomcat, Jetty, and Wildfly (formerly JBoss) on Linux servers. The most common agent parameters can be configured through Ansible variables. You'll need to install Ansible to run this role. Ansible is run from a central server to configure target hosts; these hosts must be running Linux and have unzip installed. The role should be compatible with most popular Linux distributions. Overview of process There are several steps that may be involved for installation and configuration: Install the role Incorporate role in your playbook Configure the role Configure the agent Enable custom instrumentation (optional) Step 1. Install the role To install this role, use the ansible-galaxy command on the system where you run Ansible: $ ansible-galaxy install newrelic.newrelic_java_agent Copy This will download the role from Ansible Galaxy and make it available for use in Ansible playbooks. Step 2. Incorporate the role into playbook You'll need to call the role from your playbook using the include_role module. The role's GitHub repository contains an example playbook for you to start from, which looks like this: - hosts: YOUR_HOST_GROUP vars: nr_java_agent_config: license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY app_name: YOUR_APP_NAME log_file_path: /tmp/newrelic server_type: tomcat server_root: /var/lib/tomcat8 jvm_conf_file: /usr/share/tomcat8/bin/setenv.sh server_user: tomcat8 server_group: tomcat8 service_name: tomcat8 restart_web_server: true tasks: - include_role: name: newrelic.newrelic_java_agent Copy The vars section contains a dictionary called nr_java_agent_config, which holds settings for the agent itself, and a number of variables for configuring the role's installation process. See the sections on agent configuration and role configuration for details. Step 3. Configure the role These variables are used to configure the install process. Most are required. For more information, see the examples on GitHub. Variable Description server_type Required. Web server used by your application. Possible values are: tomcat, jetty, and wildfly (standalone mode only). server_root Required. Location of the web server on the host. The agent's JAR, configuration, and (by default) log files will live in a subdirectory of this directory. jvm_conf_file Required. Path to the web server configuration file to reference the New Relic Java agent. For Tomcat, for instance, it's typically the setenv.sh file. If the file doesn't exist, it may be created, depending on the server_type. server_user server_group Required. User and group under which the web server runs. Used to set the ownership of the newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml files. restart_web_server Optional. Default: true. If set to false, the role does not restart the web server after installing the agent. Note that the agent is not activated until the web server is restarted. service_name Required (unless restart_web_server is set to false). Service name under which the web server runs. Used by Ansible to restart the web server after the agent is installed. nr_java_agent_version Optional; default: currentSpecifies the version of the Java agent to install. current will install the latest version. You can also install a specific version, like 5.9.0. For available versions, see Java agent downloads directory. Step 4. Configure the agent The following variables are used to configure the Java agent itself. These are just a few of the available options. For a full list of supported variables, see the README file on GitHub. For more about how to configure the agent, see Java agent configuration. Variable Description license_key Required. Your New Relic license key. app_name Required. Name of the application being instrumented. For more details, see App naming. proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_password proxy_scheme Optional. If you connect to the New Relic collector via a proxy, you can configure your proxy settings with these values. labels Optional. User-configurable custom labels for the agent. Labels are name-value pairs. Names and values are limited to 255 characters and cannot contain colons (:) nor semicolons (;). Value should be a semicolon-separated list of key-value pairs, for example Server:One;Data Center:Primary. Step 5. Enable custom instrumentation (optional) If you want to enable custom instrumentation, you can provide a list of XML files using the custom_instrumentation_files variable. For instance, you can specify that all Java agents being installed should use a file called my_instrumentation.xml by adding something like the following to your playbook: vars: custom_instrumentation_files: - /path/to/my_instrumentation.xml Copy See the README and examples on GitHub for more information.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...)

Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...)

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "This document describes how to pass the -javaagent argument to the JVM for your framework. This installation step ensures the agent is included in your app. For all app servers, ensure you pass the full path to the newrelic.jar file. This document is simply a reference for how to pass the argument. For detailed installation procedures, see Java agent installation. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Coldfusion To pass the -javaagent argument on Coldfusion: Start your ColdFusion server and navigate to your ColdFusion admin console. From the left menu, select SERVER SETTINGS > Java and JVM. If using the agent API: Specify the path to newrelic-api.jar in the ColdFusion Class Path field. In the JVM Arguments field, add the -javaagent argument: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Select Submit Changes, then restart your ColdFusion server. Geronimo To pass the -javaagent argument on Geronimo, refer to the New Relic agent jar in the JAVA_OPTS environment variable when running the startup command: export JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" && geronimo run Copy Glassfish To pass the -javaagent argument on Glassfish: From the Glassfish console, select Application Server > JVM Settings > JVM Options. On the JVM Options page, select Add JVM Option. Add an entry for the -javaagent argument: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Save and restart Glassfish. If Glassfish does not start, the -javaagent argument might not have been set correctly. You can change the server JVM arguments by editing the domain.xml file. Important A bug in Glassfish 2.1 prevents classes on the bootstrap class loader (the New Relic agent) from using the Java logging API. This appears to be fixed in 2.1.1 or higher releases. Grails To pass the -javaagent argument on Grails: Pass with run-app Begin with an unzipped version of Grails. Run this command: grails -noreloading -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar run-app Copy Pass with run-war In your Grails app, open this file with your text editor: grails-app/conf/BuildConfig.groovy Copy Add or edit the JVM arguments line: grails.tomcat.jvmArgs = [\"-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\"] Copy JBoss To pass the -javaagent argument on JBoss: Set with domain mode (6.x EAP and 7.0 AS) Use domain mode for JBoss versions 6.x EAP and 7.0 AS or above: Edit the JVM properties for your server group, located in: domain/configuration/domain.xml Copy Modify the properties to include the -javaagent argument: <server-group name=\"main-server-group\" profile=\"full\"> <jvm name=\"default\"> <jvm-options> <option value=\"-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\"/> </jvm-options> </jvm> ... </server-group> Copy Caution A JBoss bug in 7.0.2.Final and 7.1.0.Alpha1 does not allow JVM options to be set in domain.xml. If you encounter this problem, upgrade your JBoss application server. Set with standalone mode (other versions) Use standalone mode for other platforms and versions: Platform Directions Unix / macOS with 6.x EAP or 7.0.x AS and above At the bottom of bin/standalone.conf, add: JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy Windows with 6.x EAP or 7.0.x AS or higher In bin/standalone.bat, before the line: set JBOSS_ENDORSED_DIRS=%JBOSS_HOME%\\lib\\endorsed Copy Add: set \"JAVA_OPTS=-javaagent:C:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar %JAVA_OPTS%\" Copy Unix / macOS with 6.x or earlier At the bottom of bin/run.conf, add this: JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy Windows with 6.x or earlier In bin/run.bat, before the line: set JBOSS_CLASSPATH=%RUN_CLASSPATH% Copy Add: set \"JAVA_OPTS=-javaagent:C:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar %JAVA_OPTS%\" Copy Jetty To pass the -javaagent argument on Jetty: If you set exec in jetty.sh Edit the JAVA_OPTIONS in your jetty.sh script: export JAVA_OPTIONS=\"${JAVA_OPTIONS} -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy If you set exec in start.ini Add the agent path to your start.ini config file: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Play To pass the -javaagent argument on Play: Play 1.2.4 Append the -javaagent argument when running your Play application: play run your_app_name -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Play 2.0 Begin with an unzipped distribution containing the start script: play clean dist && unzip dist/*.zip Copy Append the -javaagent argument when starting your Play app: cd unzipped/folder; chmod a+x start; ./start -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Play 2.2 Begin with an unzipped distribution containing the start script: play clean dist && unzip target/directory/universal/*.zip Copy Append the -J-javaagent argument when starting your Play app: cd unzipped/folder; ./bin/scriptname -J-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Tip To enable page load timing, see Manual instrumentation with Play 2.2. Play 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 Begin with an unzipped distribution containing the start script: activator clean dist && unzip target/directory/universal/*.zip Copy Append the -J-javaagent argument when starting your Play app: cd unzipped/folder; ./bin/scriptname -J-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy If you use Typesafe Activator with Play 2.4, add this line to your build.sbt: javaOptions ++= Seq(\"-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\") Copy Resin To pass the -javaagent argument on Resin, add it to the <jvm-args> section in your resin.conf or resin.xml file: <jvm-arg>-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar</jvm-arg> Copy Solr To pass the -javaagent argument on Solr: Standalone Solr 5.x or higher Add the -javaagent property to bin/solr.in.sh: SOLR_OPTS=\"$SOLR_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy Standalone Solr 4.x or lower Add the -javaagent before the start.jar: java -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar -jar start.jar Copy App server Solr When running Solr in an application server, follow the instructions of that application server to add the -javaagent flag. Also ensure that JMX is enabled for the application server. If you don't see data in the APM UI's Solr page, follow the troubleshooting procedures for Solr data. Spring Boot To pass the -javaagent argument on Spring Boot, add it to the command line in which you start your app. Make sure to add it before the -jar argument: java -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar -jar app.jar Copy Tanuki Wrapper To pass the -javaagent argument on Tanuki Wrapper, add a wrapper option wrapper.conf. In the line below, substitute XXX for an unused number in this file: wrapper.java.additional.XXX=-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Tip On Linux systems, no quotation marks are required when setting this value. This behavior may vary on other operating systems. Tomcat To pass the -javaagent argument on Tomcat: With setenv.sh Create a CATALINA_BASE/bin/setenv.sh script if one doesn't already exist. Configure your setenv.sh script to use the New Relic agent using the CATALINA_OPTS environment variable: export CATALINA_OPTS=\"$CATALINA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy With setenv.bat Create a CATALINA_BASE/bin/setenv.bat script if one doesn't already exist. Configure your setenv.bat script to use the New Relic agent using the CATALINA_OPTS environment variable: SET \"CATALINA_OPTS=%CATALINA_OPTS% -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy With catalina.sh (NOT RECOMMENDED) Tip We recommend that you do not set any variables in this script. Instead put them into a script setenv.sh in CATALINA_BASE/bin to keep your customizations separate. Configure your catalina.sh file to use the New Relic agent using the JAVA_OPTS environment variable: export JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy With catalina.bat (NOT RECOMMENDED) Tip We recommend that you do not set any variables in this script. Instead put them into a script setenv.bat in CATALINA_BASE/bin to keep your customizations separate. If you use catalina.bat to launch Tomcat, set the JAVA_OPTS variable near the top of the file: SET JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy With Windows Select Start > Apache Tomcat X.Y.Z. > Configure Tomcat > Java. In the Java Options text box, enter the argument. Use forward slashes / for the path separator. For Tomcat 6, add a line break after the -javaagent argument. -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Select Apply, then restart Tomcat. With Apache Commons daemon The version of Apache Commons Daemon (jsvc) included with Tomcat 6 does not support the -javaagent argument used by New Relic. However, a build of the jsvc daemon from the trunk source will support the -javaagent argument via the -X prefix. See the Apache bug tracking the issue. There is a fix in the Apache Commons source repository. For more information: See the Apache source repository documentation. Go directly to the SVN source repository. WebLogic To pass the -javaagent argument on WebLogic: Administration servers on Linux or macOS Edit your startWebLogic.sh file, located in the domain's bin directory. Near the beginning of the file, add: export JAVA_OPTIONS=\"$JAVA_OPTIONS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy Administration servers on Windows Edit your startWebLogic.bat file, located in the domain's bin directory. Near the beginning of the file, add: set JAVA_OPTIONS=%JAVA_OPTIONS% -javaagent:\"C:\\full\\path\\to\\newrelic.jar\" Copy Managed server instances For administration server instances, follow the Linux/macOS or Windows instructions. You cannot use the administration console to install administration server instances. For managed server instances, use the admin console: From the administration console, navigate to Environments > Servers > (select a server) > Server Start > Arguments. From Arguments, add: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Save the page, then restart your server instance. WebSphere To pass the -javaagent argument on WebSphere: From the admin console, select Servers > Application servers > (select a server) > Configuration > Service Infrastructure > Java and Process Management. Select Process Definition > Additional Properties, then select Java Virtual Machine. In the Generic JVM arguments field, add the -javaagent argument for your newrelic.jar file: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Select Apply, then select Save. Restart your server. For more information, see the documentation about collecting WebSphere PMI metrics. WebSphere Community To pass the -javaagent argument on WebSphere Community Edition, refer to the New Relic agent jar in the JAVA_OPTS environment variable when running the startup command: export JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" && startup Copy WebSphere Liberty Profile To pass the -javaagent argument on WebSphere Liberty Profile: Edit ${server.config.dir}/jvm.options. Add the -javaagent argument to point to your newrelic.jar file: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Restart your server. Wildfly To pass the -javaagent argument on Wildfly (if using Wildfly 11 or higher, see additional install instructions): Set with domain mode Edit the JVM properties for your server group, located in: domain/configuration/domain.xml Copy Modify the properties to include the -javaagent argument: <server-group name=\"main-server-group\" profile=\"full\"> <jvm name=\"default\"> <jvm-options> <option value=\"-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\"/> </jvm-options> </jvm> ... </server-group> Copy Set with standalone mode Platform Directions Unix or macOS At the bottom of bin/standalone.conf, add: JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy Windows In bin/standalone.bat, find this line: rem Setup JBoss specific properties Copy Then add: set \"JAVA_OPTS=-javaagent:C:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar %JAVA_OPTS%\" Copy Other application servers The New Relic Java agent works on any supported app server. If your app server is not listed in this document, follow standard procedures for your app server to pass this argument to the JVM before the app jar: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "This document describes how to pass the -javaagent argument to the JVM for your framework. This installation step ensures the agent is included in your app. For all app servers, ensure you pass the full path to the newrelic.jar file. This document is simply a reference for how to pass the argument. For detailed installation procedures, see Java agent installation. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Coldfusion To pass the -javaagent argument on Coldfusion: Start your ColdFusion server and navigate to your ColdFusion admin console. From the left menu, select SERVER SETTINGS > Java and JVM. If using the agent API: Specify the path to newrelic-api.jar in the ColdFusion Class Path field. In the JVM Arguments field, add the -javaagent argument: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Select Submit Changes, then restart your ColdFusion server. Geronimo To pass the -javaagent argument on Geronimo, refer to the New Relic agent jar in the JAVA_OPTS environment variable when running the startup command: export JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" && geronimo run Copy Glassfish To pass the -javaagent argument on Glassfish: From the Glassfish console, select Application Server > JVM Settings > JVM Options. On the JVM Options page, select Add JVM Option. Add an entry for the -javaagent argument: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Save and restart Glassfish. If Glassfish does not start, the -javaagent argument might not have been set correctly. You can change the server JVM arguments by editing the domain.xml file. Important A bug in Glassfish 2.1 prevents classes on the bootstrap class loader (the New Relic agent) from using the Java logging API. This appears to be fixed in 2.1.1 or higher releases. Grails To pass the -javaagent argument on Grails: Pass with run-app Begin with an unzipped version of Grails. Run this command: grails -noreloading -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar run-app Copy Pass with run-war In your Grails app, open this file with your text editor: grails-app/conf/BuildConfig.groovy Copy Add or edit the JVM arguments line: grails.tomcat.jvmArgs = [\"-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\"] Copy JBoss To pass the -javaagent argument on JBoss: Set with domain mode (6.x EAP and 7.0 AS) Use domain mode for JBoss versions 6.x EAP and 7.0 AS or above: Edit the JVM properties for your server group, located in: domain/configuration/domain.xml Copy Modify the properties to include the -javaagent argument: <server-group name=\"main-server-group\" profile=\"full\"> <jvm name=\"default\"> <jvm-options> <option value=\"-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\"/> </jvm-options> </jvm> ... </server-group> Copy Caution A JBoss bug in 7.0.2.Final and 7.1.0.Alpha1 does not allow JVM options to be set in domain.xml. If you encounter this problem, upgrade your JBoss application server. Set with standalone mode (other versions) Use standalone mode for other platforms and versions: Platform Directions Unix / macOS with 6.x EAP or 7.0.x AS and above At the bottom of bin/standalone.conf, add: JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy Windows with 6.x EAP or 7.0.x AS or higher In bin/standalone.bat, before the line: set JBOSS_ENDORSED_DIRS=%JBOSS_HOME%\\lib\\endorsed Copy Add: set \"JAVA_OPTS=-javaagent:C:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar %JAVA_OPTS%\" Copy Unix / macOS with 6.x or earlier At the bottom of bin/run.conf, add this: JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy Windows with 6.x or earlier In bin/run.bat, before the line: set JBOSS_CLASSPATH=%RUN_CLASSPATH% Copy Add: set \"JAVA_OPTS=-javaagent:C:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar %JAVA_OPTS%\" Copy Jetty To pass the -javaagent argument on Jetty: If you set exec in jetty.sh Edit the JAVA_OPTIONS in your jetty.sh script: export JAVA_OPTIONS=\"${JAVA_OPTIONS} -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy If you set exec in start.ini Add the agent path to your start.ini config file: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Play To pass the -javaagent argument on Play: Play 1.2.4 Append the -javaagent argument when running your Play application: play run your_app_name -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Play 2.0 Begin with an unzipped distribution containing the start script: play clean dist && unzip dist/*.zip Copy Append the -javaagent argument when starting your Play app: cd unzipped/folder; chmod a+x start; ./start -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Play 2.2 Begin with an unzipped distribution containing the start script: play clean dist && unzip target/directory/universal/*.zip Copy Append the -J-javaagent argument when starting your Play app: cd unzipped/folder; ./bin/scriptname -J-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Tip To enable page load timing, see Manual instrumentation with Play 2.2. Play 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 Begin with an unzipped distribution containing the start script: activator clean dist && unzip target/directory/universal/*.zip Copy Append the -J-javaagent argument when starting your Play app: cd unzipped/folder; ./bin/scriptname -J-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy If you use Typesafe Activator with Play 2.4, add this line to your build.sbt: javaOptions ++= Seq(\"-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\") Copy Resin To pass the -javaagent argument on Resin, add it to the <jvm-args> section in your resin.conf or resin.xml file: <jvm-arg>-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar</jvm-arg> Copy Solr To pass the -javaagent argument on Solr: Standalone Solr 5.x or higher Add the -javaagent property to bin/solr.in.sh: SOLR_OPTS=\"$SOLR_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy Standalone Solr 4.x or lower Add the -javaagent before the start.jar: java -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar -jar start.jar Copy App server Solr When running Solr in an application server, follow the instructions of that application server to add the -javaagent flag. Also ensure that JMX is enabled for the application server. If you don't see data in the APM UI's Solr page, follow the troubleshooting procedures for Solr data. Spring Boot To pass the -javaagent argument on Spring Boot, add it to the command line in which you start your app. Make sure to add it before the -jar argument: java -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar -jar app.jar Copy Tanuki Wrapper To pass the -javaagent argument on Tanuki Wrapper, add a wrapper option wrapper.conf. In the line below, substitute XXX for an unused number in this file: wrapper.java.additional.XXX=-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Tip On Linux systems, no quotation marks are required when setting this value. This behavior may vary on other operating systems. Tomcat To pass the -javaagent argument on Tomcat: With setenv.sh Create a CATALINA_BASE/bin/setenv.sh script if one doesn't already exist. Configure your setenv.sh script to use the New Relic agent using the CATALINA_OPTS environment variable: export CATALINA_OPTS=\"$CATALINA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy With setenv.bat Create a CATALINA_BASE/bin/setenv.bat script if one doesn't already exist. Configure your setenv.bat script to use the New Relic agent using the CATALINA_OPTS environment variable: SET \"CATALINA_OPTS=%CATALINA_OPTS% -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy With catalina.sh (NOT RECOMMENDED) Tip We recommend that you do not set any variables in this script. Instead put them into a script setenv.sh in CATALINA_BASE/bin to keep your customizations separate. Configure your catalina.sh file to use the New Relic agent using the JAVA_OPTS environment variable: export JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy With catalina.bat (NOT RECOMMENDED) Tip We recommend that you do not set any variables in this script. Instead put them into a script setenv.bat in CATALINA_BASE/bin to keep your customizations separate. If you use catalina.bat to launch Tomcat, set the JAVA_OPTS variable near the top of the file: SET JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy With Windows Select Start > Apache Tomcat X.Y.Z. > Configure Tomcat > Java. In the Java Options text box, enter the argument. Use forward slashes / for the path separator. For Tomcat 6, add a line break after the -javaagent argument. -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Select Apply, then restart Tomcat. With Apache Commons daemon The version of Apache Commons Daemon (jsvc) included with Tomcat 6 does not support the -javaagent argument used by New Relic. However, a build of the jsvc daemon from the trunk source will support the -javaagent argument via the -X prefix. See the Apache bug tracking the issue. There is a fix in the Apache Commons source repository. For more information: See the Apache source repository documentation. Go directly to the SVN source repository. WebLogic To pass the -javaagent argument on WebLogic: Administration servers on Linux or macOS Edit your startWebLogic.sh file, located in the domain's bin directory. Near the beginning of the file, add: export JAVA_OPTIONS=\"$JAVA_OPTIONS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy Administration servers on Windows Edit your startWebLogic.bat file, located in the domain's bin directory. Near the beginning of the file, add: set JAVA_OPTIONS=%JAVA_OPTIONS% -javaagent:\"C:\\full\\path\\to\\newrelic.jar\" Copy Managed server instances For administration server instances, follow the Linux/macOS or Windows instructions. You cannot use the administration console to install administration server instances. For managed server instances, use the admin console: From the administration console, navigate to Environments > Servers > (select a server) > Server Start > Arguments. From Arguments, add: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Save the page, then restart your server instance. WebSphere To pass the -javaagent argument on WebSphere: From the admin console, select Servers > Application servers > (select a server) > Configuration > Service Infrastructure > Java and Process Management. Select Process Definition > Additional Properties, then select Java Virtual Machine. In the Generic JVM arguments field, add the -javaagent argument for your newrelic.jar file: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Select Apply, then select Save. Restart your server. For more information, see the documentation about collecting WebSphere PMI metrics. WebSphere Community To pass the -javaagent argument on WebSphere Community Edition, refer to the New Relic agent jar in the JAVA_OPTS environment variable when running the startup command: export JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" && startup Copy WebSphere Liberty Profile To pass the -javaagent argument on WebSphere Liberty Profile: Edit ${server.config.dir}/jvm.options. Add the -javaagent argument to point to your newrelic.jar file: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Restart your server. Wildfly To pass the -javaagent argument on Wildfly (if using Wildfly 11 or higher, see additional install instructions): Set with domain mode Edit the JVM properties for your server group, located in: domain/configuration/domain.xml Copy Modify the properties to include the -javaagent argument: <server-group name=\"main-server-group\" profile=\"full\"> <jvm name=\"default\"> <jvm-options> <option value=\"-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\"/> </jvm-options> </jvm> ... </server-group> Copy Set with standalone mode Platform Directions Unix or macOS At the bottom of bin/standalone.conf, add: JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy Windows In bin/standalone.bat, find this line: rem Setup JBoss specific properties Copy Then add: set \"JAVA_OPTS=-javaagent:C:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar %JAVA_OPTS%\" Copy Other application servers The New Relic Java agent works on any supported app server. If your app server is not listed in this document, follow standard procedures for your app server to pass this argument to the JVM before the app jar: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

Also ensure that JMX is enabled for the application server. If you don't see data in the APM UI's Solr page, follow the troubleshooting procedures for Solr data. Spring Boot To pass the -javaagent argument on Spring Boot, add it to the command line in which you start your app. Make sure to add it before the -jar argument: java -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar -jar app.jar Copy Tanuki Wrapper To pass the -javaagent argument on Tanuki Wrapper, add a wrapper option wrapper.conf. In the line below, substitute XXX for an unused number in this file: wrapper.java.additional.XXX=-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Tip On Linux systems, no quotation marks are required when setting this value. This behavior may vary on other operating systems. Tomcat To pass the -javaagent argument on Tomcat: With setenv.sh Create a CATALINA_BASE/bin/setenv.sh script if one doesn't already exist. Configure your setenv.sh script to use the New Relic agent using the CATALINA_OPTS environment variable: export CATALINA_OPTS=\"$CATALINA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy With setenv.bat Create a CATALINA_BASE/bin/setenv.bat script if one doesn't already exist. Configure your setenv.bat script to use the New Relic agent using the CATALINA_OPTS environment variable: SET \"CATALINA_OPTS=%CATALINA_OPTS% -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy With catalina.sh (NOT RECOMMENDED) Tip We recommend that you do not set any variables in this script. Instead put them into a script setenv.sh in CATALINA_BASE/bin to keep your customizations separate. Configure your catalina.sh file to use the New Relic agent using the JAVA_OPTS environment variable: export JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy With catalina.bat (NOT RECOMMENDED) Tip We recommend that you do not set any variables in this script. Instead put them into a script setenv.bat in CATALINA_BASE/bin to keep your customizations separate. If you use catalina.bat to launch Tomcat, set the JAVA_OPTS variable near the top of the file: SET JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy With Windows Select Start > Apache Tomcat X.Y.Z. > Configure Tomcat > Java. In the Java Options text box, enter the argument. Use forward slashes / for the path separator. For Tomcat 6, add a line break after the -javaagent argument. -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Select Apply, then restart Tomcat. With Apache Commons daemon The version of Apache Commons Daemon (jsvc) included with Tomcat 6 does not support the -javaagent argument used by New Relic. However, a build of the jsvc daemon from the trunk source will support the -javaagent argument via the -X prefix. See the Apache bug tracking the issue. There is a fix in the Apache Commons source repository. For more information: See the Apache source repository documentation. Go directly to the SVN source repository. WebLogic To pass the -javaagent argument on WebLogic: Administration servers on Linux or macOS Edit your startWebLogic.sh file, located in the domain's bin directory. Near the beginning of the file, add: export JAVA_OPTIONS=\"$JAVA_OPTIONS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy Administration servers on Windows Edit your startWebLogic.bat file, located in the domain's bin directory. Near the beginning of the file, add: set JAVA_OPTIONS=%JAVA_OPTIONS% -javaagent:\"C:\\full\\path\\to\\newrelic.jar\" Copy Managed server instances For administration server instances, follow the Linux/macOS or Windows instructions. You cannot use the administration console to install administration server instances. For managed server instances, use the admin console: From the administration console, navigate to Environments > Servers > (select a server) > Server Start > Arguments. From Arguments, add: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Save the page, then restart your server instance. WebSphere To pass the -javaagent argument on WebSphere: From the admin console, select Servers > Application servers > (select a server) > Configuration > Service Infrastructure > Java and Process Management. Select Process Definition > Additional Properties, then select Java Virtual Machine. In the Generic JVM arguments field, add the -javaagent argument for your newrelic.jar file: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Select Apply, then select Save. Restart your server. For more information, see the documentation about collecting WebSphere PMI metrics. WebSphere Community To pass the -javaagent argument on WebSphere Community Edition, refer to the New Relic agent jar in the JAVA_OPTS environment variable when running the startup command: export JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" && startup Copy WebSphere Liberty Profile To pass the -javaagent argument on WebSphere Liberty Profile: Edit ${server.config.dir}/jvm.options. Add the -javaagent argument to point to your newrelic.jar file: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Restart your server. Wildfly To pass the -javaagent argument on Wildfly (if using Wildfly 11 or higher, see additional install instructions): Set with domain mode Edit the JVM properties for your server group, located in: domain/configuration/domain.xml Copy Modify the properties to include the -javaagent argument: <server-group name=\"main-server-group\" profile=\"full\"> <jvm name=\"default\"> <jvm-options> <option value=\"-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\"/> </jvm-options> </jvm> ... </server-group> Copy Set with standalone mode Platform Directions Unix or macOS At the bottom of bin/standalone.conf, add: JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy Windows In bin/standalone.bat, find this line: rem Setup JBoss specific properties Copy Then add: set \"JAVA_OPTS=-javaagent:C:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar %JAVA_OPTS%\" Copy Other application servers The New Relic Java agent works on any supported app server. If your app server is not listed in this document, follow standard procedures for your app server to pass this argument to the JVM before the app jar: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "New Relic for Java gives you multiple methods to ignore specific transactions. This document explains how to use the Java agent API annotations and ServletRequest to ignore transactions. It is also possible to use the ignoreTransaction() API call and XML instrumentation files to ignore transactions. Important Ignoring transactions involves changing your application's source code and recompiling your application in all cases unless you use an XML instrumentation file. If you cannot manipulate your code, use XML to ignore transactions. Ignore web transactions with ServletRequest To ignore a web transaction, set a ServletRequest attribute named com.newrelic.agent.IGNORE to true during the request: request.setAttribute(\"com.newrelic.agent.IGNORE\", true); Copy To specify URLs to ignore, create a servlet filter which sets that attribute and apply the filter to the servlet you want to ignore. The filter will have access to the request URI if you need to ignore specific URLs. Ignore transactions with annotation To tell the Java agent to ignore transactions using annotations: Define an annotation called NewRelicIgnoreTransaction in your application's code or a library you can integrate with your application: @Target(ElementType.METHOD) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) public @interface NewRelicIgnoreTransaction { } Copy Apply the annotation to the methods or classes you want to ignore. For example: @NewRelicIgnoreTransaction public void methodToBeIgnored() { } Copy If a transaction calls a method or class annotated with @NewRelicIgnoreTransaction, the transaction is ignored. This means it does not contribute to the overall Apdex score; and the transaction trace and performance data is not reported. Ignore apdex but not traces You can also prevent the transaction from contributing to the Apdex score but still be used in transaction. This can prevent one particularly lengthy transaction from skewing your Apdex score. To prevent a transaction from contributing to your Apdex score: Define an annotation called NewRelicIgnoreApdex in your application's code or a library you can integrate with your application: @Target(ElementType.METHOD) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) public @interface NewRelicIgnoreApdex { } Copy Apply the annotation to the methods or classes you want to ignore. For example: @NewRelicIgnoreApdex public void ignoreApdexOfThisMethod() { } Copy If a transaction calls a method or class annotated with @NewRelicIgnoreApdex, the transaction is reported, but does not contribute to the overall Apdex score.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "The Java agent is a fully-featured library that automatically collects data from many popular servers, frameworks, libraries, and datastores (for a full list, see Compatibility and requirements). It also has a significant feature set. However, there are always additional requests for functionality and instrumentation of new libraries. The Java agent provides extension modules for this purpose. Extension modules fall into three general categories: Incubator instrumentation modules: Experimental new support to collect data from specific libraries Archived instrumentation modules: Instrumentation for libraries that the original company or author no longer maintains or updates. Feature extension modules: Code that adds new behavior to the agent, independent of any specific library. If your library isn't covered by the automatic instrumentation or by an instrumentation module, you can still collect data with custom instrumentation. Tip If you have feedback, questions, or problems with this instrumentation, create a post in New Relic's Explorers Hub, and tag your post with java_incubator. Install extension modules We recommend updating to the latest Java agent version before installing an extension module. To install an extension module: Download the appropriate .jar file from module lists below. Locate the directory that contains your newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml files. In that directory, create a sub-directory named extensions (if there is not already one there). Copy the .jar extension module you downloaded into the extensions directory. For Feature extension modules, update your newrelic.yml with feature-specific configuration. Restart your server. Send some traffic to the server or host that will exercise the feature or instrumentation. Tip Java agent extension modules are subject to the New Relic Java agent licenses, which are included in each module jar's LICENSE file. Feature extension modules Extension modules are additional libraries that add commonly-requested functionality. To use the an extension module, download it and put it in the Extensions Directory. Class Histogram Download link Download the module The Class Histogram extension runs jmap periodically and generates ClassHistogramRowEvent and ClassHistogramStatsEvent data that you can query and chart. Querying this data can be useful when troubleshooting memory leaks as you can see the values over time. You configure the Class Histogram extension the same way you configure the Java agent: using environment variables, system properties, or newrelic.yml.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "The Java agent is a fully-featured library that automatically collects data from many popular servers, frameworks, libraries, and datastores (for a full list, see Compatibility and requirements). It also has a significant feature set. However, there are always additional requests for functionality and instrumentation of new libraries. The Java agent provides extension modules for this purpose. Extension modules fall into three general categories: Incubator instrumentation modules: Experimental new support to collect data from specific libraries Archived instrumentation modules: Instrumentation for libraries that the original company or author no longer maintains or updates. Feature extension modules: Code that adds new behavior to the agent, independent of any specific library. If your library isn't covered by the automatic instrumentation or by an instrumentation module, you can still collect data with custom instrumentation. Tip If you have feedback, questions, or problems with this instrumentation, create a post in New Relic's Explorers Hub, and tag your post with java_incubator. Install extension modules We recommend updating to the latest Java agent version before installing an extension module. To install an extension module: Download the appropriate .jar file from module lists below. Locate the directory that contains your newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml files. In that directory, create a sub-directory named extensions (if there is not already one there). Copy the .jar extension module you downloaded into the extensions directory. For Feature extension modules, update your newrelic.yml with feature-specific configuration. Restart your server. Send some traffic to the server or host that will exercise the feature or instrumentation. Tip Java agent extension modules are subject to the New Relic Java agent licenses, which are included in each module jar's LICENSE file. Feature extension modules Extension modules are additional libraries that add commonly-requested functionality. To use the an extension module, download it and put it in the Extensions Directory. Class Histogram Download link Download the module The Class Histogram extension runs jmap periodically and generates ClassHistogramRowEvent and ClassHistogramStatsEvent data that you can query and chart. Querying this data can be useful when troubleshooting memory leaks as you can see the values over time. You configure the Class Histogram extension the same way you configure the Java agent: using environment variables, system properties, or newrelic.yml. Here are available properties, with defaults: extensions: class_histogram: enabled: true # true is the default if the extension is present classes_per_histogram: 50 # 50 is the default, and memory leak issues are usually in the highest 50 classes by bytes jmap_path: /your/jdk/bin # The folder where the jmap binary lives. The default is $JAVA_HOME/bin. delay_between_calls_seconds: 60 # Length of the delay between executions to avoid frequent pauses Copy Incubator instrumentation modules Incubator modules are experimental instrumentation, which we may build into the agent's automatic instrumentation in the future. These are the incubator modules that are currently available: Apache Camel 2.12 Download link Download the module This instrumentation module intercepts the following: org.apache.camel.component.http.CamelServlet.resolve Copy To name the transaction so that web transactions have a finer grained name than the Camel servlet name, it uses this: org.apache.camel.component.http.HttpConsumer.getPath() Copy To view the bytecode, use this terminal command: javap -verbose -cp camel-2.12-FILENAME.jar org.apache.camel.component.http.CamelServlet Copy C3P0 database connection pools Download link Download the module Java agent version 3.12.0 or higher This instrumentation module samples C3P0 connection pools and reports busy and idle counts in metrics that start with this: Custom/Database Connection/C3P0/METRIC_NAME Copy You can view the metrics with the metric explorer.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "The Java agent is a fully-featured library that automatically collects data from many popular servers, frameworks, libraries, and datastores (for a full list, see Compatibility and requirements). It also has a significant feature set. However, there are always additional requests for functionality and instrumentation of new libraries. The Java agent provides extension modules for this purpose. Extension modules fall into three general categories: Incubator instrumentation modules: Experimental new support to collect data from specific libraries Archived instrumentation modules: Instrumentation for libraries that the original company or author no longer maintains or updates. Feature extension modules: Code that adds new behavior to the agent, independent of any specific library. If your library isn't covered by the automatic instrumentation or by an instrumentation module, you can still collect data with custom instrumentation. Tip If you have feedback, questions, or problems with this instrumentation, create a post in New Relic's Explorers Hub, and tag your post with java_incubator. Install extension modules We recommend updating to the latest Java agent version before installing an extension module. To install an extension module: Download the appropriate .jar file from module lists below. Locate the directory that contains your newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml files. In that directory, create a sub-directory named extensions (if there is not already one there). Copy the .jar extension module you downloaded into the extensions directory. For Feature extension modules, update your newrelic.yml with feature-specific configuration. Restart your server. Send some traffic to the server or host that will exercise the feature or instrumentation. Tip Java agent extension modules are subject to the New Relic Java agent licenses, which are included in each module jar's LICENSE file. Feature extension modules Extension modules are additional libraries that add commonly-requested functionality. To use the an extension module, download it and put it in the Extensions Directory. Class Histogram Download link Download the module The Class Histogram extension runs jmap periodically and generates ClassHistogramRowEvent and ClassHistogramStatsEvent data that you can query and chart. Querying this data can be useful when troubleshooting memory leaks as you can see the values over time. You configure the Class Histogram extension the same way you configure the Java agent: using environment variables, system properties, or newrelic.yml. Here are available properties, with defaults: extensions: class_histogram: enabled: true # true is the default if the extension is present classes_per_histogram: 50 # 50 is the default, and memory leak issues are usually in the highest 50 classes by bytes jmap_path: /your/jdk/bin # The folder where the jmap binary lives. The default is $JAVA_HOME/bin. delay_between_calls_seconds: 60 # Length of the delay between executions to avoid frequent pauses Copy Incubator instrumentation modules Incubator modules are experimental instrumentation, which we may build into the agent's automatic instrumentation in the future. These are the incubator modules that are currently available: Apache Camel 2.12 Download link Download the module This instrumentation module intercepts the following: org.apache.camel.component.http.CamelServlet.resolve Copy To name the transaction so that web transactions have a finer grained name than the Camel servlet name, it uses this: org.apache.camel.component.http.HttpConsumer.getPath() Copy To view the bytecode, use this terminal command: javap -verbose -cp camel-2.12-FILENAME.jar org.apache.camel.component.http.CamelServlet Copy C3P0 database connection pools Download link Download the module Java agent version 3.12.0 or higher This instrumentation module samples C3P0 connection pools and reports busy and idle counts in metrics that start with this: Custom/Database Connection/C3P0/METRIC_NAME Copy You can view the metrics with the metric explorer.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "The Java agent is a fully-featured library that automatically collects data from many popular servers, frameworks, libraries, and datastores (for a full list, see Compatibility and requirements). It also has a significant feature set. However, there are always additional requests for functionality and instrumentation of new libraries. The Java agent provides extension modules for this purpose. Extension modules fall into three general categories: Incubator instrumentation modules: Experimental new support to collect data from specific libraries Archived instrumentation modules: Instrumentation for libraries that the original company or author no longer maintains or updates. Feature extension modules: Code that adds new behavior to the agent, independent of any specific library. If your library isn't covered by the automatic instrumentation or by an instrumentation module, you can still collect data with custom instrumentation. Tip If you have feedback, questions, or problems with this instrumentation, create a post in New Relic's Explorers Hub, and tag your post with java_incubator. Install extension modules We recommend updating to the latest Java agent version before installing an extension module. To install an extension module: Download the appropriate .jar file from module lists below. Locate the directory that contains your newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml files. In that directory, create a sub-directory named extensions (if there is not already one there). Copy the .jar extension module you downloaded into the extensions directory. For Feature extension modules, update your newrelic.yml with feature-specific configuration. Restart your server. Send some traffic to the server or host that will exercise the feature or instrumentation. Tip Java agent extension modules are subject to the New Relic Java agent licenses, which are included in each module jar's LICENSE file. Feature extension modules Extension modules are additional libraries that add commonly-requested functionality. To use the an extension module, download it and put it in the Extensions Directory. Class Histogram Download link Download the module The Class Histogram extension runs jmap periodically and generates ClassHistogramRowEvent and ClassHistogramStatsEvent data that you can query and chart. Querying this data can be useful when troubleshooting memory leaks as you can see the values over time. You configure the Class Histogram extension the same way you configure the Java agent: using environment variables, system properties, or newrelic.yml. Here are available properties, with defaults: extensions: class_histogram: enabled: true # true is the default if the extension is present classes_per_histogram: 50 # 50 is the default, and memory leak issues are usually in the highest 50 classes by bytes jmap_path: /your/jdk/bin # The folder where the jmap binary lives. The default is $JAVA_HOME/bin. delay_between_calls_seconds: 60 # Length of the delay between executions to avoid frequent pauses Copy Incubator instrumentation modules Incubator modules are experimental instrumentation, which we may build into the agent's automatic instrumentation in the future. These are the incubator modules that are currently available: Apache Camel 2.12 Download link Download the module This instrumentation module intercepts the following: org.apache.camel.component.http.CamelServlet.resolve Copy To name the transaction so that web transactions have a finer grained name than the Camel servlet name, it uses this: org.apache.camel.component.http.HttpConsumer.getPath() Copy To view the bytecode, use this terminal command: javap -verbose -cp camel-2.12-FILENAME.jar org.apache.camel.component.http.CamelServlet Copy C3P0 database connection pools Download link Download the module Java agent version 3.12.0 or higher This instrumentation module samples C3P0 connection pools and reports busy and idle counts in metrics that start with this: Custom/Database Connection/C3P0/METRIC_NAME Copy You can view the metrics with the metric explorer.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "The Java agent is a fully-featured library that automatically collects data from many popular servers, frameworks, libraries, and datastores (for a full list, see Compatibility and requirements). It also has a significant feature set. However, there are always additional requests for functionality and instrumentation of new libraries. The Java agent provides extension modules for this purpose. Extension modules fall into three general categories: Incubator instrumentation modules: Experimental new support to collect data from specific libraries Archived instrumentation modules: Instrumentation for libraries that the original company or author no longer maintains or updates. Feature extension modules: Code that adds new behavior to the agent, independent of any specific library. If your library isn't covered by the automatic instrumentation or by an instrumentation module, you can still collect data with custom instrumentation. Tip If you have feedback, questions, or problems with this instrumentation, create a post in New Relic's Explorers Hub, and tag your post with java_incubator. Install extension modules We recommend updating to the latest Java agent version before installing an extension module. To install an extension module: Download the appropriate .jar file from module lists below. Locate the directory that contains your newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml files. In that directory, create a sub-directory named extensions (if there is not already one there). Copy the .jar extension module you downloaded into the extensions directory. For Feature extension modules, update your newrelic.yml with feature-specific configuration. Restart your server. Send some traffic to the server or host that will exercise the feature or instrumentation. Tip Java agent extension modules are subject to the New Relic Java agent licenses, which are included in each module jar's LICENSE file. Feature extension modules Extension modules are additional libraries that add commonly-requested functionality. To use the an extension module, download it and put it in the Extensions Directory. Class Histogram Download link Download the module The Class Histogram extension runs jmap periodically and generates ClassHistogramRowEvent and ClassHistogramStatsEvent data that you can query and chart. Querying this data can be useful when troubleshooting memory leaks as you can see the values over time. You configure the Class Histogram extension the same way you configure the Java agent: using environment variables, system properties, or newrelic.yml. Here are available properties, with defaults: extensions: class_histogram: enabled: true # true is the default if the extension is present classes_per_histogram: 50 # 50 is the default, and memory leak issues are usually in the highest 50 classes by bytes jmap_path: /your/jdk/bin # The folder where the jmap binary lives. The default is $JAVA_HOME/bin. delay_between_calls_seconds: 60 # Length of the delay between executions to avoid frequent pauses Copy Incubator instrumentation modules Incubator modules are experimental instrumentation, which we may build into the agent's automatic instrumentation in the future. These are the incubator modules that are currently available: Apache Camel 2.12 Download link Download the module This instrumentation module intercepts the following: org.apache.camel.component.http.CamelServlet.resolve Copy To name the transaction so that web transactions have a finer grained name than the Camel servlet name, it uses this: org.apache.camel.component.http.HttpConsumer.getPath() Copy To view the bytecode, use this terminal command: javap -verbose -cp camel-2.12-FILENAME.jar org.apache.camel.component.http.CamelServlet Copy C3P0 database connection pools Download link Download the module Java agent version 3.12.0 or higher This instrumentation module samples C3P0 connection pools and reports busy and idle counts in metrics that start with this: Custom/Database Connection/C3P0/METRIC_NAME Copy You can view the metrics with the metric explorer.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...)

Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute.

Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes.

      "body": "The Java agent is a fully-featured library that automatically collects data from many popular servers, frameworks, libraries, and datastores (for a full list, see Compatibility and requirements). It also has a significant feature set. However, there are always additional requests for functionality and instrumentation of new libraries. The Java agent provides extension modules for this purpose. Extension modules fall into three general categories: Incubator instrumentation modules: Experimental new support to collect data from specific libraries Archived instrumentation modules: Instrumentation for libraries that the original company or author no longer maintains or updates. Feature extension modules: Code that adds new behavior to the agent, independent of any specific library. If your library isn't covered by the automatic instrumentation or by an instrumentation module, you can still collect data with custom instrumentation. Tip If you have feedback, questions, or problems with this instrumentation, create a post in New Relic's Explorers Hub, and tag your post with java_incubator. Install extension modules We recommend updating to the latest Java agent version before installing an extension module. To install an extension module: Download the appropriate .jar file from module lists below. Locate the directory that contains your newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml files. In that directory, create a sub-directory named extensions (if there is not already one there). Copy the .jar extension module you downloaded into the extensions directory. For Feature extension modules, update your newrelic.yml with feature-specific configuration. Restart your server. Send some traffic to the server or host that will exercise the feature or instrumentation. Tip Java agent extension modules are subject to the New Relic Java agent licenses, which are included in each module jar's LICENSE file. Feature extension modules Extension modules are additional libraries that add commonly-requested functionality. To use the an extension module, download it and put it in the Extensions Directory. Class Histogram Download link Download the module The Class Histogram extension runs jmap periodically and generates ClassHistogramRowEvent and ClassHistogramStatsEvent data that you can query and chart. Querying this data can be useful when troubleshooting memory leaks as you can see the values over time. You configure the Class Histogram extension the same way you configure the Java agent: using environment variables, system properties, or newrelic.yml. Here are available properties, with defaults: extensions: class_histogram: enabled: true # true is the default if the extension is present classes_per_histogram: 50 # 50 is the default, and memory leak issues are usually in the highest 50 classes by bytes jmap_path: /your/jdk/bin # The folder where the jmap binary lives. The default is $JAVA_HOME/bin. delay_between_calls_seconds: 60 # Length of the delay between executions to avoid frequent pauses Copy Incubator instrumentation modules Incubator modules are experimental instrumentation, which we may build into the agent's automatic instrumentation in the future. These are the incubator modules that are currently available: Apache Camel 2.12 Download link Download the module This instrumentation module intercepts the following: org.apache.camel.component.http.CamelServlet.resolve Copy To name the transaction so that web transactions have a finer grained name than the Camel servlet name, it uses this: org.apache.camel.component.http.HttpConsumer.getPath() Copy To view the bytecode, use this terminal command: javap -verbose -cp camel-2.12-FILENAME.jar org.apache.camel.component.http.CamelServlet Copy C3P0 database connection pools Download link Download the module Java agent version 3.12.0 or higher This instrumentation module samples C3P0 connection pools and reports busy and idle counts in metrics that start with this: Custom/Database Connection/C3P0/METRIC_NAME Copy You can view the metrics with the metric explorer.

When finished troubleshooting, be sure to set the log file back to a less verbose setting, such as info. Requirements If you only change the log file setting in your newrelic.yml file, you do not need to restart the server or JVM. However, if you make any other changes, you must restart your server or JVM. Be sure you keep the original line indentation in your newrelic.yml file. YAML is \"space sensitive\" and requires proper indentation. The audit_mode setting (when set to true ) will also log communication between the Java agent and New Relic to the log file.

Generate log files To generate detailed finest log files: Edit your newrelic.yml file, and change the log_level to finest. Be sure to keep these lines indented two spaces. # The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging # separate from that of your application. Specify the log level here. # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application. # The levels in increasing order of verboseness are: # off, severe, warning, info, fine, finer, finest # Default is info. log_level: finest # Log all data sent to and from New Relic in plain text. # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application. # Default is false. audit_mode: false Copy Exercise your web application for about five minutes to generate sufficient logging data. After testing, change the log_level to a less verbose level, such as info (default). Open your log files and examine them for errors. Examine log files Important The finest log setting is a highly verbose logging level. To reduce disk space consumption after testing, return the log_level to its original setting.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

When finished troubleshooting, be sure to set the log file back to a less verbose setting, such as info. Requirements If you only change the log file setting in your newrelic.yml file, you do not need to restart the server or JVM. However, if you make any other changes, you must restart your server or JVM. Be sure you keep the original line indentation in your newrelic.yml file. YAML is \"space sensitive\" and requires proper indentation. The audit_mode setting (when set to true ) will also log communication between the Java agent and New Relic to the log file. New Relic Support may occasionally request audit mode logs for additional troubleshooting. Generate log files To generate detailed finest log files: Edit your newrelic.yml file, and change the log_level to finest. Be sure to keep these lines indented two spaces. # The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging # separate from that of your application. Specify the log level here. # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application. # The levels in increasing order of verboseness are: # off, severe, warning, info, fine, finer, finest # Default is info. log_level: finest # Log all data sent to and from New Relic in plain text. # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application. # Default is false. audit_mode: false Copy Exercise your web application for about five minutes to generate sufficient logging data. After testing, change the log_level to a less verbose level, such as info (default). Open your log files and examine them for errors. Examine log files Important The finest log setting is a highly verbose logging level. To reduce disk space consumption after testing, return the log_level to its original setting. By default, log files are stored in a logs sub-directory, inside the same directory as newrelic.jar. If necessary, follow the troubleshooting procedures if no log files appear.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci).

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

However, if you make any other changes, you must restart your server or JVM. Be sure you keep the original line indentation in your newrelic.yml file. YAML is \"space sensitive\" and requires proper indentation. The audit_mode setting (when set to true ) will also log communication between the Java agent and New Relic to the log file.

      "body": "When troubleshooting your New Relic Java agent, generate finest logs to find and investigate errors. When finished troubleshooting, be sure to set the log file back to a less verbose setting, such as info. Requirements If you only change the log file setting in your newrelic.yml file, you do not need to restart the server or JVM. However, if you make any other changes, you must restart your server or JVM. Be sure you keep the original line indentation in your newrelic.yml file. YAML is \"space sensitive\" and requires proper indentation. The audit_mode setting (when set to true ) will also log communication between the Java agent and New Relic to the log file. New Relic Support may occasionally request audit mode logs for additional troubleshooting. Generate log files To generate detailed finest log files: Edit your newrelic.yml file, and change the log_level to finest. Be sure to keep these lines indented two spaces. # The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging # separate from that of your application. Specify the log level here. # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application. # The levels in increasing order of verboseness are: # off, severe, warning, info, fine, finer, finest # Default is info. log_level: finest # Log all data sent to and from New Relic in plain text. # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application. # Default is false. audit_mode: false Copy Exercise your web application for about five minutes to generate sufficient logging data. After testing, change the log_level to a less verbose level, such as info (default). Open your log files and examine them for errors. Examine log files Important The finest log setting is a highly verbose logging level. To reduce disk space consumption after testing, return the log_level to its original setting. By default, log files are stored in a logs sub-directory, inside the same directory as newrelic.jar. If necessary, follow the troubleshooting procedures if no log files appear.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

When finished troubleshooting, be sure to set the log file back to a less verbose setting, such as info. Requirements If you only change the log file setting in your newrelic.yml file, you do not need to restart the server or JVM. However, if you make any other changes, you must restart your server or JVM. Be sure you keep the original line indentation in your newrelic.yml file. YAML is \"space sensitive\" and requires proper indentation. The audit_mode setting (when set to true ) will also log communication between the Java agent and New Relic to the log file. New Relic Support may occasionally request audit mode logs for additional troubleshooting. Generate log files To generate detailed finest log files: Edit your newrelic.yml file, and change the log_level to finest. Be sure to keep these lines indented two spaces. # The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging # separate from that of your application. Specify the log level here. # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application. # The levels in increasing order of verboseness are: # off, severe, warning, info, fine, finer, finest # Default is info. log_level: finest # Log all data sent to and from New Relic in plain text. # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application. # Default is false. audit_mode: false Copy Exercise your web application for about five minutes to generate sufficient logging data. After testing, change the log_level to a less verbose level, such as info (default). Open your log files and examine them for errors. Examine log files Important The finest log setting is a highly verbose logging level. To reduce disk space consumption after testing, return the log_level to its original setting. By default, log files are stored in a logs sub-directory, inside the same directory as newrelic.jar. If necessary, follow the troubleshooting procedures if no log files appear.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to...

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

When finished troubleshooting, be sure to set the log file back to a less verbose setting, such as info. Requirements If you only change the log file setting in your newrelic.yml file, you do not need to restart the server or JVM. However, if you make any other changes, you must restart your server or JVM. Be sure you keep the original line indentation in your newrelic.yml file. YAML is \"space sensitive\" and requires proper indentation. The audit_mode setting (when set to true ) will also log communication between the Java agent and New Relic to the log file. New Relic Support may occasionally request audit mode logs for additional troubleshooting. Generate log files To generate detailed finest log files: Edit your newrelic.yml file, and change the log_level to finest. Be sure to keep these lines indented two spaces. # The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging # separate from that of your application. Specify the log level here. # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application. # The levels in increasing order of verboseness are: # off, severe, warning, info, fine, finer, finest # Default is info. log_level: finest # Log all data sent to and from New Relic in plain text. # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application. # Default is false. audit_mode: false Copy Exercise your web application for about five minutes to generate sufficient logging data. After testing, change the log_level to a less verbose level, such as info (default). Open your log files and examine them for errors. Examine log files Important The finest log setting is a highly verbose logging level. To reduce disk space consumption after testing, return the log_level to its original setting.

See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service.

The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...)

Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...)

When finished troubleshooting, be sure to set the log file back to a less verbose setting, such as info. Requirements If you only change the log file setting in your newrelic.yml file, you do not need to restart the server or JVM. However, if you make any other changes, you must restart your server or JVM. Be sure you keep the original line indentation in your newrelic.yml file. YAML is \"space sensitive\" and requires proper indentation. The audit_mode setting (when set to true ) will also log communication between the Java agent and New Relic to the log file. New Relic Support may occasionally request audit mode logs for additional troubleshooting. Generate log files To generate detailed finest log files: Edit your newrelic.yml file, and change the log_level to finest. Be sure to keep these lines indented two spaces. # The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging # separate from that of your application. Specify the log level here. # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application. # The levels in increasing order of verboseness are: # off, severe, warning, info, fine, finer, finest # Default is info. log_level: finest # Log all data sent to and from New Relic in plain text. # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application. # Default is false. audit_mode: false Copy Exercise your web application for about five minutes to generate sufficient logging data. After testing, change the log_level to a less verbose level, such as info (default). Open your log files and examine them for errors. Examine log files Important The finest log setting is a highly verbose logging level. To reduce disk space consumption after testing, return the log_level to its original setting. By default, log files are stored in a logs sub-directory, inside the same directory as newrelic.jar. If necessary, follow the troubleshooting procedures if no log files appear.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

When finished troubleshooting, be sure to set the log file back to a less verbose setting, such as info. Requirements If you only change the log file setting in your newrelic.yml file, you do not need to restart the server or JVM. However, if you make any other changes, you must restart your server or JVM. Be sure you keep the original line indentation in your newrelic.yml file. YAML is \"space sensitive\" and requires proper indentation. The audit_mode setting (when set to true ) will also log communication between the Java agent and New Relic to the log file.

Be sure to keep these lines indented two spaces. # The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging # separate from that of your application. Specify the log level here. # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application. # The levels in increasing order of verboseness are: # off, severe, warning, info, fine, finer, finest # Default is info. log_level: finest # Log all data sent to and from New Relic in plain text. # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application. # Default is false. audit_mode: false Copy Exercise your web application for about five minutes to generate sufficient logging data. After testing, change the log_level to a less verbose level, such as info (default). Open your log files and examine them for errors. Examine log files Important The finest log setting is a highly verbose logging level. To reduce disk space consumption after testing, return the log_level to its original setting.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

However, if you make any other changes, you must restart your server or JVM. Be sure you keep the original line indentation in your newrelic.yml file. YAML is \"space sensitive\" and requires proper indentation. The audit_mode setting (when set to true ) will also log communication between the Java agent and New Relic to the log file.

      "body": "When troubleshooting your New Relic Java agent, generate finest logs to find and investigate errors. When finished troubleshooting, be sure to set the log file back to a less verbose setting, such as info. Requirements If you only change the log file setting in your newrelic.yml file, you do not need to restart the server or JVM. However, if you make any other changes, you must restart your server or JVM. Be sure you keep the original line indentation in your newrelic.yml file. YAML is \"space sensitive\" and requires proper indentation. The audit_mode setting (when set to true ) will also log communication between the Java agent and New Relic to the log file. New Relic Support may occasionally request audit mode logs for additional troubleshooting. Generate log files To generate detailed finest log files: Edit your newrelic.yml file, and change the log_level to finest. Be sure to keep these lines indented two spaces. # The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging # separate from that of your application. Specify the log level here. # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application. # The levels in increasing order of verboseness are: # off, severe, warning, info, fine, finer, finest # Default is info. log_level: finest # Log all data sent to and from New Relic in plain text. # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application. # Default is false. audit_mode: false Copy Exercise your web application for about five minutes to generate sufficient logging data. After testing, change the log_level to a less verbose level, such as info (default). Open your log files and examine them for errors. Examine log files Important The finest log setting is a highly verbose logging level. To reduce disk space consumption after testing, return the log_level to its original setting. By default, log files are stored in a logs sub-directory, inside the same directory as newrelic.jar. If necessary, follow the troubleshooting procedures if no log files appear.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

When finished troubleshooting, be sure to set the log file back to a less verbose setting, such as info. Requirements If you only change the log file setting in your newrelic.yml file, you do not need to restart the server or JVM. However, if you make any other changes, you must restart your server or JVM. Be sure you keep the original line indentation in your newrelic.yml file. YAML is \"space sensitive\" and requires proper indentation. The audit_mode setting (when set to true ) will also log communication between the Java agent and New Relic to the log file. New Relic Support may occasionally request audit mode logs for additional troubleshooting. Generate log files To generate detailed finest log files: Edit your newrelic.yml file, and change the log_level to finest. Be sure to keep these lines indented two spaces. # The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging # separate from that of your application. Specify the log level here. # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application. # The levels in increasing order of verboseness are: # off, severe, warning, info, fine, finer, finest # Default is info. log_level: finest # Log all data sent to and from New Relic in plain text. # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application. # Default is false. audit_mode: false Copy Exercise your web application for about five minutes to generate sufficient logging data.

Please reach out to the engineering team if that is not enough. Configuration file options When you're changing the navigation, keep in mind that each node in the .yml configuration file can have the following properties: Key Required? Description title yes The text that is shown in the navigation. path * no The URL path to the page. Do not use trailing slashes. * Adding a path is required to generate auto index page content. See path requirements below. children no Any sub-navigation nodes. When the user goes to a page, we determine which section of the site they are on and load the appropriate .yml file to populate the sidebar navigation. The navigation for the homepage is an aggregate of all the top-level pages. Tip Each category has its own index.md page (list of pages for that category). When updating the navigation, you may also want to update these pages to reflect the new information architecture more correctly. Use nav YAML to generate auto index content On build we automatically generate an index page for each sub-directory in src/content that does not already have an index.mdx file and that has at least one .mdx or .md file in it. When creating the page we look through each nav YAML file for a reference to the path to know which nav data to use for the left nav and the auto index page content. If an index page path is in more than one nav YAML file, we use the nav that matches its top level path with the beginning of index page path. Nav requirements for auto index pages In order to populate the auto index page with nav YAML data, you must add the index page path somewhere in the most relevant nav YAML file. This helps the auto index page plugin determine which nav to attach to the index page, but also helps the <IndexContents /> component know which section to display on the index page itself. Each nav item must reference a directory path in src/content that contains at least one .md or .mdx file (otherwise the auto index plugin does not create a page for it). Example If this auto index page is used in full-stack-observability.yml and integrations.yml, we will attach the integrations.yml nav to it because: the top level path in the integrations.yml matches the beginning of the auto index page path: title: Integrations path: /docs/integrations Copy matches this auto index page path: /docs/integrations /amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list Copy",

      "body": "With real time streaming, your APM event data is sent to New Relic every five seconds. You can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in near real time. The smaller payloads result in faster chart refreshes and faster queries of data that is the most important to you. No configuration is needed to take advantage of real time streaming. All you need to do is ensure your APM agent version is up to date. Why it matters Real time streaming doesn't result in more events being sent. The combination of more frequent posts, with a smaller number of events per post, results in approximately the same number of events per minute as there would be without real time streaming. The following image shows a comparison between data sent to New Relic with and without real time streaming. Note that 10,000 is an example number of events; some agents have lower default limits. The overall limits on how many events can be sent per minute haven't changed. Also, non-event data (spans, traces, and metrics) are unaffected; they're still sent every minute. Use real time streaming to quickly understand the impact when something has changed, such as deploying a new app version. Examine key performance indicators (throughput, error rates, charting, etc.) in near real time. Respond quickly to failure conditions and anomalies. Get the most out of New Relic One dashboards. Reduce mean time to detection with APM events reporting every five seconds. Agent version to automatically enable To enable real time streaming, update to the latest New Relic APM agent. You don't need to configure anything to enable real time streaming; it will automatically report faster! Real time streaming is supported by all APM agents. Here are the minimum agent versions: C SDK: v1.3.0 or higher Go: v2.8.0 or higher Java: v5.5.0 or higher .NET: v8.23.107.0 or higher Node.js: v5.13.0 or higher PHP: v9.5.0.252 or higher Python: v5.2.0.127 or higher Ruby: v6.7.0.359 or higher Caution If Transaction event reporting is disabled, this can affect some UI elements throughout New Relic. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Query real time streaming data When building charts, include the following in your NRQL query: NRQL clause Comments SINCE 5 minutes ago Be sure to add a SINCE 5 minutes ago clause to your NRQL query in order to take advantage of the 5 second chart refresh interval. This is because the chart's refresh interval is based on the time window. TIMESERIES bucket To set the refresh interval for time series charts, you can also specify the bucket size as an optional argument to the TIMESERIES clause. For example, SINCE 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 5 seconds will display a 30 minute window at a 5 second resolution. You can have a maximum of 366 buckets. Create real time streaming charts You can visualize the results of your NRQL query in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com, and at the top of the page, select Query your data. Use the chart builder to start building a chart. Select the advanced (NRQL) mode. (If you start with basic mode, switch to advanced mode to complete the next step.) In your NRQL query, adjust the SINCE and TIMESERIES clauses to take advantage of the 5 second refresh intervals.",

      "body": "At each step of your cloud adoption process, New Relic plays a critical role in helping you establish baselines, prioritize migration steps, validate improvements, and manage cloud costs. New Relic can also help you refactor, or re-architect, your software and services when you migrate them to the cloud. One key aspect of refactoring your software is splitting out your components into different services available from your cloud provider. For example, you might move your database component away from a traditional MySQL database to a cloud-hosted solution, like Amazon Relational Database (RDS) services such as DynamoDB or Aurora. If you move to the Azure cloud, you might adopt Azure SQL or Cosmos DB. When you move to solutions like those, you increase your database redundancy and resiliency. If you evaluate your overall ROI properly, you should start to see the cost/benefit ratio taking effect once you complete your refactoring. 1. Deploy monitoring New Relic is a true multi-tenant SaaS solution, meaning New Relic designed the agents to work at every layer of your application stack. To get started, deploy the agents: APM to collect application-tier performance metrics Browser monitoring to collect front-end web metrics Mobile monitoring to collect front-end mobile app metrics Infrastructure to collect host/server metrics Cloud-based integrations As you refactor your application and integrate new cloud services, you can also use New Relic to monitor and report data about your cloud services, offering you a comprehensive view of your entire architecture in one place. Cloud-based integrations available through New Relic include Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. This tutorial describes a database migration and focuses on APM and Infrastructure. 2. Set deployment markers With New Relic, you can track deployments by setting deployment markers. Deployment tracking lets you quickly see how deployments affect your application’s performance and gauge its performance before and after you refactor. You can view deployments on the Deployments page in APM: rpm.newrelic.com/apm > (selected app) > Events > Deployments: Here is an example of the Deployments page and details about a selected deployment. 3. Establish baselines When you install the APM agent at the application layer, New Relic immediately starts collecting and displaying metrics. Use these metrics to set your pre-migration application baseline. APM agents collect performance metrics about outbound calls to databases. In the Monitoring section of the APM UI, click Databases to see a view of your database metrics. The following shows a database running on MySQL that will be refactored to use DynamoDB after migrating to AWS: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Databases: Use this page to view and sort detailed information about database performance. 4. Refactor your applications To take advantage of the cloud, research what services are available from your cloud provider, and then re-architect and uncouple your applications. 5. Create dashboards to track refactoring your applications Apply your KPIs to your baseline measurements to validate cloud improvements, and, ideally, start seeing the impact of moving to the cloud. New Relic’s reporting for database interactions goes much deeper than high-level performance metrics about calls to the database layer in APM. You get access to metrics about slow queries so you can filter by database vendor and cache type. You can also see host and instance details for databases visually within Service Maps and within the context of transaction traces. Because all of your performance metrics are available in New Relic Insights, it is easy to build dashboards to show the performance of your database calls before, during, and after your refactoring in a single unified view. Here is an example of an Insights dashboard for an application that uses DynamoDB and was migrated to AWS: insights.newrelic.com: Build a dashboard that shows the performance of your database calls. 6. Create comparison dashboards To compare both the pre- and post-refactor baselines, create an Insights dashboard that displays the KPIs you baselined. The following dashboard shows the MySQL request query latency as compared with all of the operations for DynamoDB. You can see that, for this example, the request query latency for DynamoDB is too small to even register on the graph. Performance is clearly optimized with this cloud-based database. insights.newrelic.com: Use Insights dashboards to visualize pre- and post-refactor baselines. With APM agents and the integrations New Relic provides, you can measure the effectiveness of refactoring your applications using a broad spectrum of metrics.

      "body": "Review and manage how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB) on the Data retention page. This page helps you understand the sources of data that you’re storing, when they were last updated, and the length the data is stored. Retention settings range from 8 to 395 days depending on the data's source and namespace classifications in New Relic. From the Data retention page, which shows the source of data, you can click Edit settings to adjust the data retention for each source. Important This doc applies to accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and account/user structure. Adjusting retention values You can adjust your retention periods to better support your data needs. You might reduce your contracted retention values to optimize query performance. Conversely, you might increase retention for some data types to support more granular analysis over longer periods of time, or to meet data compliance requirements. The ability to edit data retention periods differs depending on your edition: Standard edition: your data retention is fixed, and falls between 8 and 395 days (about 13 months) of retention, depending on which capabilities of the New Relic platform you’re using. The prescribed retention levels ensure that you can explore your data and experience the value of New Relic. If you need to raise some of the retention limits for your particular business needs, you can purchase additional retention. Pro or Enterprise: If after you finalize your contracted retention you realize you need to make changes, you can adjust your telemetry data retention settings yourself. Tip Reducing data retention below your contracted retention values will not reduce New Relic’s data ingest charges. Conversely, increasing retention for targeted telemetry data types should trigger a conversation with New Relic about adjusting your data ingest charges. Retention periods The following table shows the default retention settings for our New Relic One pricing plan. To adjust retention settings, you must be on a Pro or Enterprise tier. Source Event namespace Days retained APM APM 8 APM APM errors 8 Browser Browser 8 Browser Browser events 8 Browser Browser JS errors 8 Browser Browser page view timing 8 Custom events Custom events 30 Serverless Lambda 8 Serverless Lambda custom 8 Serverless Lambda spans 8 Logs Log 30 Infrastructure Infrastructure processes 8 Infrastructure Infrastructure integrations 395 (13 months) Mobile Mobile crash event trails (breadcrumb) 8 Mobile Mobile exception 8 Mobile Mobile general 8 Mobile Mobile error 8 Mobile Mobile crash 90 Mobile Mobile session 90 Synthetics Synthetics data 395 (13 months) Traces Traces 8 Metric data rollup Metric timeslice data is generated by APM (both custom metrics and out-of-the-box metrics), Mobile, and Browser agents. MTS data is aggregated first to 1-minute rollups retained for 8 days, then aggregated to 1-hour roll-ups for 90 days, with key metric data in turn being stored indefinitely. We meter on the size of the initial 1-minute rollup, not on any of the subsequent rollups. Read on to learn the key metrics by product. Key metrics reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Here are the key metrics that are stored indefinitely. Product Key metrics APM Apdex, for app server Throughput and page views Response time, plus breakdown into tiers or categories on your app's main Overview chart Page load time, plus breakdown into segments Error rate CPU usage Memory usage Browser Apdex, for browser Browser page load time Throughput total. After 90 days, there is no breakout by browser type, and only the combined average value is available for the time range requested. Mobile Crash rate: For iOS and for Android Network throughput Network response time Network error rates Interaction traces Metric raw data Metric raw data, from APM, Prometheus remote-write API, metrics functionality of the Telemetry SDK, and integrations built on the Telemetry SDK, is handled a little differently. Raw sub-minute metric data is stored for 30 days. Beyond 30 days, 1-minute resolution roll-up events are created and retained for 13 months. As with Metric timeslice data, we meter and bill on the size of the raw ingest, not the subsequent rollups. Metric retention periods are not editable. Account inheritance For organizations that have master/sub-account structures, data retention is inherited by a master account's sub-accounts. If a sub-account has its own retention settings, those override settings inherited from the master account. Copy retention values If you have permission to edit retention settings, you can also copy retention values from one sub-account to other sub-accounts under the same master account. To do this, from within a sub-account, select the Copy settings to other accounts link, and then select the sub-accounts you want to apply the retention values to. Select the sub-accounts you want to copy retention values to. Data deletion Once telemetry data (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its data retention ends. Original pricing plan differences If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, you have different data retention rules. See Original data retention.",

The navigation for the homepage is an aggregate of all the top-level pages. Tip Each category has its own index.md page (list of pages for that category). When updating the navigation, you may also want to update these pages to reflect the new information architecture more correctly. Use nav YAML to generate auto index content On build we automatically generate an index page for each sub-directory in src/content that does not already have an index.mdx file and that has at least one .mdx or .md file in it. When creating the page we look through each nav YAML file for a reference to the path to know which nav data to use for the left nav and the auto index page content. If an index page path is in more than one nav YAML file, we use the nav that matches its top level path with the beginning of index page path. Nav requirements for auto index pages In order to populate the auto index page with nav YAML data, you must add the index page path somewhere in the most relevant nav YAML file. This helps the auto index page plugin determine which nav to attach to the index page, but also helps the <IndexContents /> component know which section to display on the index page itself. Each nav item must reference a directory path in src/content that contains at least one .md or .mdx file (otherwise the auto index plugin does not create a page for it). Example If this auto index page is used in full-stack-observability.yml and integrations.yml, we will attach the integrations.yml nav to it because: the top level path in the integrations.yml matches the beginning of the auto index page path: title: Integrations path: /docs/integrations Copy matches this auto index page path: /docs/integrations /amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list Copy",

This helps the auto index page plugin determine which nav to attach to the index page, but also helps the <IndexContents /> component know which section to display on the index page itself. Each nav item must reference a directory path in src/content that contains at least one .md or .mdx file (otherwise the auto index plugin does not create a page for it). Example If this auto index page is used in full-stack-observability.yml and integrations.yml, we will attach the integrations.yml nav to it because: the top level path in the integrations.yml matches the beginning of the auto index page path: title: Integrations path: /docs/integrations Copy matches this auto index page path: /docs/integrations /amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list Copy",

      "body": "With real time streaming, your APM event data is sent to New Relic every five seconds. You can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in near real time. The smaller payloads result in faster chart refreshes and faster queries of data that is the most important to you. No configuration is needed to take advantage of real time streaming. All you need to do is ensure your APM agent version is up to date. Why it matters Real time streaming doesn't result in more events being sent. The combination of more frequent posts, with a smaller number of events per post, results in approximately the same number of events per minute as there would be without real time streaming. The following image shows a comparison between data sent to New Relic with and without real time streaming. Note that 10,000 is an example number of events; some agents have lower default limits. The overall limits on how many events can be sent per minute haven't changed. Also, non-event data (spans, traces, and metrics) are unaffected; they're still sent every minute. Use real time streaming to quickly understand the impact when something has changed, such as deploying a new app version. Examine key performance indicators (throughput, error rates, charting, etc.) in near real time. Respond quickly to failure conditions and anomalies. Get the most out of New Relic One dashboards. Reduce mean time to detection with APM events reporting every five seconds. Agent version to automatically enable To enable real time streaming, update to the latest New Relic APM agent. You don't need to configure anything to enable real time streaming; it will automatically report faster! Real time streaming is supported by all APM agents. Here are the minimum agent versions: C SDK: v1.3.0 or higher Go: v2.8.0 or higher Java: v5.5.0 or higher .NET: v8.23.107.0 or higher Node.js: v5.13.0 or higher PHP: v9.5.0.252 or higher Python: v5.2.0.127 or higher Ruby: v6.7.0.359 or higher Caution If Transaction event reporting is disabled, this can affect some UI elements throughout New Relic. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Query real time streaming data When building charts, include the following in your NRQL query: NRQL clause Comments SINCE 5 minutes ago Be sure to add a SINCE 5 minutes ago clause to your NRQL query in order to take advantage of the 5 second chart refresh interval. This is because the chart's refresh interval is based on the time window. TIMESERIES bucket To set the refresh interval for time series charts, you can also specify the bucket size as an optional argument to the TIMESERIES clause. For example, SINCE 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 5 seconds will display a 30 minute window at a 5 second resolution. You can have a maximum of 366 buckets. Create real time streaming charts You can visualize the results of your NRQL query in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com, and at the top of the page, select Query your data. Use the chart builder to start building a chart. Select the advanced (NRQL) mode. (If you start with basic mode, switch to advanced mode to complete the next step.) In your NRQL query, adjust the SINCE and TIMESERIES clauses to take advantage of the 5 second refresh intervals.",

You'll most likely edit a version of this file in your branch and merge it into the develop branch. The configuration file As an example, here's a snippet of the agents.yml navigation configuration.

Please reach out to the engineering team if that is not enough. Configuration file options When you're changing the navigation, keep in mind that each node in the .yml configuration file can have the following properties: Key Required? Description title yes The text that is shown in the navigation. path * no The URL path to the page. Do not use trailing slashes. * Adding a path is required to generate auto index page content. See path requirements below. children no Any sub-navigation nodes. When the user goes to a page, we determine which section of the site they are on and load the appropriate .yml file to populate the sidebar navigation. The navigation for the homepage is an aggregate of all the top-level pages. Tip Each category has its own index.md page (list of pages for that category). When updating the navigation, you may also want to update these pages to reflect the new information architecture more correctly. Use nav YAML to generate auto index content On build we automatically generate an index page for each sub-directory in src/content that does not already have an index.mdx file and that has at least one .mdx or .md file in it. When creating the page we look through each nav YAML file for a reference to the path to know which nav data to use for the left nav and the auto index page content. If an index page path is in more than one nav YAML file, we use the nav that matches its top level path with the beginning of index page path. Nav requirements for auto index pages In order to populate the auto index page with nav YAML data, you must add the index page path somewhere in the most relevant nav YAML file. This helps the auto index page plugin determine which nav to attach to the index page, but also helps the <IndexContents /> component know which section to display on the index page itself. Each nav item must reference a directory path in src/content that contains at least one .md or .mdx file (otherwise the auto index plugin does not create a page for it). Example If this auto index page is used in full-stack-observability.yml and integrations.yml, we will attach the integrations.yml nav to it because: the top level path in the integrations.yml matches the beginning of the auto index page path: title: Integrations path: /docs/integrations Copy matches this auto index page path: /docs/integrations /amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list Copy",

Please reach out to the engineering team if that is not enough. Configuration file options When you're changing the navigation, keep in mind that each node in the .yml configuration file can have the following properties: Key Required? Description title yes The text that is shown in the navigation. path * no The URL path to the page. Do not use trailing slashes. * Adding a path is required to generate auto index page content. See path requirements below. children no Any sub-navigation nodes. When the user goes to a page, we determine which section of the site they are on and load the appropriate .yml file to populate the sidebar navigation. The navigation for the homepage is an aggregate of all the top-level pages. Tip Each category has its own index.md page (list of pages for that category). When updating the navigation, you may also want to update these pages to reflect the new information architecture more correctly. Use nav YAML to generate auto index content On build we automatically generate an index page for each sub-directory in src/content that does not already have an index.mdx file and that has at least one .mdx or .md file in it. When creating the page we look through each nav YAML file for a reference to the path to know which nav data to use for the left nav and the auto index page content. If an index page path is in more than one nav YAML file, we use the nav that matches its top level path with the beginning of index page path. Nav requirements for auto index pages In order to populate the auto index page with nav YAML data, you must add the index page path somewhere in the most relevant nav YAML file. This helps the auto index page plugin determine which nav to attach to the index page, but also helps the <IndexContents /> component know which section to display on the index page itself. Each nav item must reference a directory path in src/content that contains at least one .md or .mdx file (otherwise the auto index plugin does not create a page for it). Example If this auto index page is used in full-stack-observability.yml and integrations.yml, we will attach the integrations.yml nav to it because: the top level path in the integrations.yml matches the beginning of the auto index page path: title: Integrations path: /docs/integrations Copy matches this auto index page path: /docs/integrations /amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list Copy",

      "body": "With real time streaming, your APM event data is sent to New Relic every five seconds. You can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in near real time. The smaller payloads result in faster chart refreshes and faster queries of data that is the most important to you. No configuration is needed to take advantage of real time streaming. All you need to do is ensure your APM agent version is up to date. Why it matters Real time streaming doesn't result in more events being sent. The combination of more frequent posts, with a smaller number of events per post, results in approximately the same number of events per minute as there would be without real time streaming. The following image shows a comparison between data sent to New Relic with and without real time streaming. Note that 10,000 is an example number of events; some agents have lower default limits. The overall limits on how many events can be sent per minute haven't changed. Also, non-event data (spans, traces, and metrics) are unaffected; they're still sent every minute. Use real time streaming to quickly understand the impact when something has changed, such as deploying a new app version. Examine key performance indicators (throughput, error rates, charting, etc.) in near real time. Respond quickly to failure conditions and anomalies. Get the most out of New Relic One dashboards. Reduce mean time to detection with APM events reporting every five seconds. Agent version to automatically enable To enable real time streaming, update to the latest New Relic APM agent. You don't need to configure anything to enable real time streaming; it will automatically report faster! Real time streaming is supported by all APM agents. Here are the minimum agent versions: C SDK: v1.3.0 or higher Go: v2.8.0 or higher Java: v5.5.0 or higher .NET: v8.23.107.0 or higher Node.js: v5.13.0 or higher PHP: v9.5.0.252 or higher Python: v5.2.0.127 or higher Ruby: v6.7.0.359 or higher Caution If Transaction event reporting is disabled, this can affect some UI elements throughout New Relic. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Query real time streaming data When building charts, include the following in your NRQL query: NRQL clause Comments SINCE 5 minutes ago Be sure to add a SINCE 5 minutes ago clause to your NRQL query in order to take advantage of the 5 second chart refresh interval. This is because the chart's refresh interval is based on the time window. TIMESERIES bucket To set the refresh interval for time series charts, you can also specify the bucket size as an optional argument to the TIMESERIES clause. For example, SINCE 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 5 seconds will display a 30 minute window at a 5 second resolution. You can have a maximum of 366 buckets. Create real time streaming charts You can visualize the results of your NRQL query in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com, and at the top of the page, select Query your data. Use the chart builder to start building a chart. Select the advanced (NRQL) mode. (If you start with basic mode, switch to advanced mode to complete the next step.) In your NRQL query, adjust the SINCE and TIMESERIES clauses to take advantage of the 5 second refresh intervals.",

      "body": "New Relic collects and reports information on web transactions and non-web transactions, such as background tasks. New Relic normally produces complete information automatically, without any need to modify your application code. However, if you are not using a supported framework, you may need to add custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation is also useful to: Add detail to your transaction traces. Block instrumentation on selected transactions you do not want instrumented. Instrument a part of your code that New Relic simply is not picking up. Custom instrumentation that creates a new transaction collects both metric timeslice and event data. Custom instrumentation for already instrumented transactions collects only metric timeslice data. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. When to use custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to track interactions that are not captured by New Relic's automatic instrumentation. Custom instrumentation can also add detail to your transaction traces, to help you identify key issues. New Relic collects data from many frameworks automatically. If you are using a supported framework, you should not need custom instrumentation to collect metric timeslices, events, and traces. However, if you encounter any of these situations, you may need custom instrumentation: Transactions do not appear in the UI. Transaction traces include large blocks of application code time without full detail. If you are using a supported framework, but are not seeing transaction on the New Relic APM Transactions page, get support at support.newrelic.com to ensure the framework instrumentation is working. Implement custom instrumentation Each agent implements custom instrumentation differently: C SDK custom instrumentation For applications monitored by the C SDK, you must manually instrument transactions, segments, and errors. For more information, see the C SDK instrumentation procedures. Go custom instrumentation Because Golang apps run from a compiled, native binary file, all New Relic instrumentation must be done manually. See Instrument Go transactions and Instrument Go segments for how to set up instrumentation in your Go app. Java custom instrumentation New Relic's Java agent supports two methods of custom instrumentation: Annotation: Add @Trace annotations to your code to ensure New Relic instruments specific methods. Annotation is easy to implement, if you are instrumenting only a few methods. For more complex instrumentation, or if you are unable to modify your code, use XML. XML: Define the methods you want New Relic to monitor in an XML file. XML instrumentation is flexible and doesn't require editing your code, but is more difficult to troubleshoot than annotation. For more information, see Java custom instrumentation. .NET custom instrumentation New Relic's .NET agent supports two methods of custom instrumentation: Attributes: Annotate your code with agent API calls to instrument specific methods. Annotation is easy to implement, but requires editing your source code. XML: Define the methods you want New Relic to instrument in an XML file. XML instrumentation does not require modifying your source code, but is more complicated to create and keep updated than attribute instrumentation. For more information, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js custom instrumentation New Relic's Node.js agent uses API calls for custom instrumentation. For more information, see Node.js custom instrumentation. PHP custom instrumentation New Relic's PHP agent uses API calls for custom instrumentation. For more information, see PHP custom instrumentation. Python custom instrumentation New Relic's Python agent supports two methods of custom instrumentation: Configuration file: Use the agent configuration file to specify the functions and methods you want instrumented. The agent configuration file is easy to set up, and it does not require you to modify your code. However, it is less flexible than API calls. API calls: Edit your code to call the New Relic Python API. The API is more flexible than instrumentation via the configuration file, but it requires you to modify your code. For more information, see Python custom instrumentation. Ruby custom instrumentation New Relic's Ruby agent uses API calls to define target methods and add transaction tracers to them. For more information, see Ruby custom instrumentation. Grouping issues A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently-named metric timeslices to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. Custom instrumentation can cause metric grouping issues if you introduce too many uniquely-named metric timeslices that New Relic cannot effectively group. If you send thousands of metrics, New Relic may apply rules to reduce the number of transactions.",

The navigation for the homepage is an aggregate of all the top-level pages. Tip Each category has its own index.md page (list of pages for that category). When updating the navigation, you may also want to update these pages to reflect the new information architecture more correctly. Use nav YAML to generate auto index content On build we automatically generate an index page for each sub-directory in src/content that does not already have an index.mdx file and that has at least one .mdx or .md file in it. When creating the page we look through each nav YAML file for a reference to the path to know which nav data to use for the left nav and the auto index page content. If an index page path is in more than one nav YAML file, we use the nav that matches its top level path with the beginning of index page path. Nav requirements for auto index pages In order to populate the auto index page with nav YAML data, you must add the index page path somewhere in the most relevant nav YAML file. This helps the auto index page plugin determine which nav to attach to the index page, but also helps the <IndexContents /> component know which section to display on the index page itself. Each nav item must reference a directory path in src/content that contains at least one .md or .mdx file (otherwise the auto index plugin does not create a page for it). Example If this auto index page is used in full-stack-observability.yml and integrations.yml, we will attach the integrations.yml nav to it because: the top level path in the integrations.yml matches the beginning of the auto index page path: title: Integrations path: /docs/integrations Copy matches this auto index page path: /docs/integrations /amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list Copy",

      "body": "When working with your data in New Relic, you may want to view aggregated data for an application across clusters, environments, or data centers, while at the same time be able to view each of your application instance's data individually. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file. Roll up app data Normally, when two instances report with the same app name, agent language, and license key, New Relic aggregates their data into a single app within the New Relic user interface. You can also view data for the individual hosts and instances from the app's New Relic APM Overview page. To segment your app in a different way, or to work with each instance as an individual app while maintaining the overall view of the data, use your New Relic agent's config file to give an app up to three different rollup names. New Relic will then report the app's data separately to each app listed in the config file. For example, you might want to separate the data collected for your app running in development, staging, and production environments, but also have a common view of the app in every environment. Or, if you have two data centers running the same code, you could name one app EastCoastApp;AggregateApp and the second app WestCoastApp;AggregateApp. Prevent duplicate transaction events By default, an app with multiple names will generate multiple Insights events for transactions (a duplicate transaction for each name). For example, if you give your app three names, that's three times the number of Insights events for transactions. To avoid duplicate Insights events, disable collection for each of the duplicate app names: Go to one.newrelic.com or one.eu.newrelic.com > More > Manage Insights Data. Toggle data collection on/off for duplicate app names, then save. To prevent duplicate events from being collected for an app with multiple names, go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > Configure data sources. Roll up Browser data When you use multiple names to report application data, any Browser monitoring data from that application will also be grouped into multiple applications using the same configuration. Important Session trace data will only report to the first application listed. Other Browser data will populate into each of the up to three applications, but session trace data will be limited to the most specific application. Define app names from most to least specific You can give each app up to three names, which New Relic uses to aggregate data from most to least specific. You can then use the New Relic UI to view data for each app name individually, as well as in aggregate for overall application performance. When doing so, the order in which you specify the app names is important. Using multiple names Comments Most specific A unique rollup name. Less specific A shared rollup name to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. This provides more general organization. Optional, least specific An additional, shared rollup name. If used, this is the most general name New Relic uses to aggregate data into a single app. Name app instances via agent config file The naming convention you use in your configuration file depends on your New Relic agent. Set the order of your app's names so that the first rollup name is the most unique. The second and third names can be unique, or they can be the same. The second name is more general for aggregate data, and the third name (if used) is the most general. Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ; in your newrelic_app_config_t * config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the string of names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP Use any of the available options to name your PHP application. Use three names separated by a semicolon. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. For more information, refer to the configuration file documentation for your agent. Examples Here are examples of how you could use multiple rollup names for a single app. One app, three clusters A Java app collecting survey data runs on three clusters. Change the value for the app name in your agent config file by giving it three different names, one for each cluster. Cluster 1: app_name: SurveyCluster1;Survey Data Copy Cluster 2: app_name: SurveyCluster2;Survey Data Copy Cluster 3: app_name: SurveyCluster3;Survey Data Copy This will report four applications in New Relic APM: The app name for aggregate data from all three clusters is Survey Data. Three individual applications named SurveyCluster1, SurveyCluster2, and SurveyCluster3. Two instances of one app A PHP agent is monitoring an e-commerce application running on two clusters in each of two data centers, and you want to view data for each subgroup as well as the overall aggregated data. Cluster A: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterA;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster B: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterB;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster C: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterC;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster D: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterD;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy This example configuration will report seven applications in the New Relic APM UI: Four apps: One for each of the four clusters (A B C D) Two apps: One for each datacenter (East and West) One app for the overall data across clusters and data centers (EcomAll) Other options to organize your apps If you do not want to apply multiple names to your apps, you can organize them with labels and categories. This allows you to easily sort, filter, and page through them from their product index pages in the New Relic UI. You can also set distinct performance thresholds for each environment with alert conditions and key transactions. These thresholds will apply to the individual apps, while the overall app will not have its own thresholds. The overall app will treat incoming data according to the threshold for the relevant enviroment.",

      "body": "New Relic connects metrics to individual applications using your license key and the primary application name. You can change the app's name in your config file, or assign an alias to the app to change how it appears in the New Relic UI. Important If you do not specify the app name in your New Relic configuration file, most New Relic agents provide a generic application name by default. To ensure all aggregated data for the same app is reported accurately, make sure you give each app a descriptive name. Changing the name vs. the alias You can assign a new app name or change the app alias. These have two different effects: Term How to change it Effect Name Assign the name in your config file Changing the app name in the agent's configuration file will cause the application to report to a new heading in the New Relic user interface, with a total discontinuity of data. This is useful, for example, if you want to start over and report new data. If no other agents are reporting to the old app name, the old app name will appear gray and can be deleted. Alias Change the alias in the APM Settings UI Creating an alias for the app name only changes how the app name appears in the New Relic UI. Changing the alias does not affect how data is reported. It simply helps you keep track of your data with a useful alias. Give each app a descriptive name By default, most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as My Application or PHP Application, for each app that is linked to your account. Important We recommend changing the default name of an app to a more descriptive name before deployment, and it can be up to 128 characters long. Each unique app name creates a new application record in your New Relic UI, which allows you to: Run an application on more than one host, and have all the data aggregated (collected) under the same name. Run multiple applications on a single host, and have all the data aggregated (collected) under different names. Assign the name in your config file To change the app name, set the app name value in the agent's configuration file. If you have deployed an app via one APM agent, and then deploy another app with the same name via a different APM agent, New Relic will automatically append the agent language name to the end of the second app's name. For example, if you deploy a Node.js app named New-App, and then deploy a .NET app named New-App, New Relic will automatically append the second app name as New-App (DOTNET). Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ;in your newrelic_app_config_t* config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java See the options for naming your Java application. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP See the options for naming your PHP application. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Change the application's alias The application name you set in the New Relic user interface is a human-readable alias. If you rename your app, the visible name is updated everywhere in the New Relic site, including New Relic Browser. Initially, this alias is the same as the app's identifier name in the New Relic agent configuration file. However, changing the UI alias does not affect the underlying app name used for data rollup, which is set in the agent config file. The application must be actively reporting data to change the alias. Changing the UI alias will cause all agents that report under the app identifier to restart themselves. To change the alias for your application's name in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. In the Application alias field, type a new name (alias) for the selected app. Select Save application settings. Tip You can also change the app's alias with the New Relic REST API. Using multiple names for an app By giving your app multiple names, you can aggregate metrics for multiple agents across an entire app or service. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file.",

The navigation for the homepage is an aggregate of all the top-level pages. Tip Each category has its own index.md page (list of pages for that category). When updating the navigation, you may also want to update these pages to reflect the new information architecture more correctly. Use nav YAML to generate auto index content On build we automatically generate an index page for each sub-directory in src/content that does not already have an index.mdx file and that has at least one .mdx or .md file in it. When creating the page we look through each nav YAML file for a reference to the path to know which nav data to use for the left nav and the auto index page content. If an index page path is in more than one nav YAML file, we use the nav that matches its top level path with the beginning of index page path. Nav requirements for auto index pages In order to populate the auto index page with nav YAML data, you must add the index page path somewhere in the most relevant nav YAML file. This helps the auto index page plugin determine which nav to attach to the index page, but also helps the <IndexContents /> component know which section to display on the index page itself. Each nav item must reference a directory path in src/content that contains at least one .md or .mdx file (otherwise the auto index plugin does not create a page for it). Example If this auto index page is used in full-stack-observability.yml and integrations.yml, we will attach the integrations.yml nav to it because: the top level path in the integrations.yml matches the beginning of the auto index page path: title: Integrations path: /docs/integrations Copy matches this auto index page path: /docs/integrations /amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list Copy",

Please reach out to the engineering team if that is not enough. Configuration file options When you're changing the navigation, keep in mind that each node in the .yml configuration file can have the following properties: Key Required? Description title yes The text that is shown in the navigation. path * no The URL path to the page. Do not use trailing slashes. * Adding a path is required to generate auto index page content. See path requirements below. children no Any sub-navigation nodes. When the user goes to a page, we determine which section of the site they are on and load the appropriate .yml file to populate the sidebar navigation. The navigation for the homepage is an aggregate of all the top-level pages. Tip Each category has its own index.md page (list of pages for that category). When updating the navigation, you may also want to update these pages to reflect the new information architecture more correctly. Use nav YAML to generate auto index content On build we automatically generate an index page for each sub-directory in src/content that does not already have an index.mdx file and that has at least one .mdx or .md file in it. When creating the page we look through each nav YAML file for a reference to the path to know which nav data to use for the left nav and the auto index page content. If an index page path is in more than one nav YAML file, we use the nav that matches its top level path with the beginning of index page path. Nav requirements for auto index pages In order to populate the auto index page with nav YAML data, you must add the index page path somewhere in the most relevant nav YAML file. This helps the auto index page plugin determine which nav to attach to the index page, but also helps the <IndexContents /> component know which section to display on the index page itself. Each nav item must reference a directory path in src/content that contains at least one .md or .mdx file (otherwise the auto index plugin does not create a page for it). Example If this auto index page is used in full-stack-observability.yml and integrations.yml, we will attach the integrations.yml nav to it because: the top level path in the integrations.yml matches the beginning of the auto index page path: title: Integrations path: /docs/integrations Copy matches this auto index page path: /docs/integrations /amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list Copy",

      "body": "New Relic's default APM agent settings provide a high level of security. However, you may need to guarantee that even if the default APM agent settings are overridden to be more permissive, no sensitive data will ever be sent to New Relic. If this is the case, then you will want to turn on APM's high security mode (also known as enterprise security mode). For more information about our security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Requirements Customers on our New Relic One pricing plan require Enterprise edition. Customers on our original pricing plan have access depending on their subscription level. Account level If you choose to turn on high security, you must enable high security for all applications reporting to the account. High security must be set on each individual account. For organizations with multiple accounts, sub-accounts do not automatically inherit the high security setting when it is enabled on the master account. Currently there are two versions of high security mode. Version 1 is deprecated and is only available if you already have it. If you are enabling high security mode for the first time, the only option is version 2 (v2). Agent Version 2 support C SDK n/a Go All versions Java 3.7 or higher (enabled by default) .NET 3.3 or higher Node.js 1.7.0 or higher PHP 4.9 or higher Python 2.22.0.0 or higher Ruby 3.9.1 or higher Enable high security mode (version 2) To enable high security, you must update both the local configuration on your server and the remote configuration in the UI. Caution Once you enable high security for an account, high security cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. Setting location Description Set in UI To set high security in the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown and select Account settings. On that page, select High security mode. If you are on our original pricing plan, only the account owner can view this option. If the agent is configured for high security via the UI but not locally, then the agent connections will be rejected, and the agent will shut down. However, this won't shut down your application. Local, via agent Enable high security mode in your agent configuration file. High security mode is disabled by default, and the exact procedure to enable it varies by agent: C SDK: n/a Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby If the agent is configured for high security locally but not via the UI, then the agent connections will be rejected, and the agent will shut down. This will not shut down your application. Results of enabling high security mode (version 2) Once enabled, high security mode (v2) ensures the following for your account: Feature Comments Requires agents to use a secure connection (HTTPS) High security mode requires a secure (HTTPS) connection. Non-secure connection attempts will be rejected. The latest version of all New Relic agents support HTTPS. If the configuration is not set appropriately, the agent will override the property to ensure all data in transit per the latest industry standards. Prevents HTTP param capture High security mode does not allow HTTP params, which may contain sensitive customer data, to be sent to the New Relic collector. If the agent is configured to send HTTP params locally or through server-side configuration, high security mode will override the configuration to never capture HTTP params. Prevents message queue param capture High security mode does not allow message queue params, which may contain sensitive customer data, to be sent to the New Relic collector. If the agent is configured to send message queue params locally or through server-side configuration, then high security mode will override the configuration to never capture message queue params. Prevents raw query statement capture High security mode does not allow raw database query statements, which may contain sensitive customer data, to be captured. If the agent is configured to capture raw queries locally or through server-side configuration, then high security mode will override the configuration to never capture raw queries. Prevents user attribute capture High security mode does not allow attributes set using each agent's API to be captured, as these may contain sensitive customer data. For example, in the Java agent, attributes passed in through the following NewRelic agent API calls will be blocked: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(String key, String value) Copy NewRelic.addCustomParameter(String key, Number value) Copy NewRelic.setUserName(String name) Copy NewRelic.setAccountName(String name) Copy NewRelic.setProductName(String name) Copy Prevents noticeError attribute capture High security mode does not allow attributes set using each agent's noticeError API call to be captured as these may contain sensitive customer data. For example, in the Java agent, attributes passed in through the following NewRelic agent API calls will be blocked: NewRelic.noticeError(String message, Map<String, String> params) Copy NewRelic.noticeError(Throwable throwable, Map<String, String> params) Copy Prevents custom events High security mode does not allow custom events to be created using the agent API, as these may contain sensitive customer data. For example, in the .NET agent, the API call RecordCustomEvent will be blocked. Prevents deploying Custom Instrumentation via CIE High security mode does not allow deploying custom instrumentation when using the Custom Instrumentation Editor. If you have high security mode enabled, you must export the instrumentation and manually import it to your app server. Results of enabling high security mode v1 (deprecated) High security mode version 1 is deprecated and only available if you enabled it prior to version 2 being available. High security mode version 1 ensures the following for your account: Feature Comments Requires agents to use a secure connection (HTTPS) High security mode requires an encrypted connection (HTTPS). Non-secure connection attempts will be rejected. The latest version of all New Relic agents support HTTPS. If the configuration is not set appropriately, the agent will override the property to ensure that all data in transit is encrypted as per the latest industry standards. Prevents HTTP param capture Agents configured to capture HTTP params, which may contain sensitive customer data, are not allowed to connect to New Relic. If the local configuration is set to capture request parameters, then New Relic's collector will reject the connection, and the agent will shut down. Prevents raw query statement capture Agents configured to capture raw database query statements, which may contain sensitive customer data, are not allowed to connect to New Relic. If the agent is configured to capture raw queries locally or through server-side configuration, New Relic's collector will reject the connection and the agent will shut down. Prevents deploying Custom Instrumentation via CIE High security mode does not allow deploying custom instrumentation when using the Custom Instrumentation Editor. If you have high security mode enabled, you must export the instrumentation and manually import it to your app server. Migrate from version 1 to version 2 These are the main differences between the two versions of high security: In order to make high security even more secure, high security must be enabled in the New Relic user interface and in the local New Relic configuration file. High security v1 only required high security to be set in the New Relic UI. User attributes, noticeError attributes, and message queue parameters are turned off with high security in version 2, but not in version 1. To update from v1 to v2, add high_security: true to your local agent configuration file.",

You'll most likely edit a version of this file in your branch and merge it into the develop branch. The configuration file As an example, here's a snippet of the agents.yml navigation configuration. Note that the file has indentation that corresponds to the level of the navigation hierarchy.

Please reach out to the engineering team if that is not enough. Configuration file options When you're changing the navigation, keep in mind that each node in the .yml configuration file can have the following properties: Key Required? Description title yes The text that is shown in the navigation. path * no The URL path to the page. Do not use trailing slashes. * Adding a path is required to generate auto index page content. See path requirements below. children no Any sub-navigation nodes. When the user goes to a page, we determine which section of the site they are on and load the appropriate .yml file to populate the sidebar navigation. The navigation for the homepage is an aggregate of all the top-level pages. Tip Each category has its own index.md page (list of pages for that category). When updating the navigation, you may also want to update these pages to reflect the new information architecture more correctly. Use nav YAML to generate auto index content On build we automatically generate an index page for each sub-directory in src/content that does not already have an index.mdx file and that has at least one .mdx or .md file in it. When creating the page we look through each nav YAML file for a reference to the path to know which nav data to use for the left nav and the auto index page content. If an index page path is in more than one nav YAML file, we use the nav that matches its top level path with the beginning of index page path. Nav requirements for auto index pages In order to populate the auto index page with nav YAML data, you must add the index page path somewhere in the most relevant nav YAML file. This helps the auto index page plugin determine which nav to attach to the index page, but also helps the <IndexContents /> component know which section to display on the index page itself. Each nav item must reference a directory path in src/content that contains at least one .md or .mdx file (otherwise the auto index plugin does not create a page for it). Example If this auto index page is used in full-stack-observability.yml and integrations.yml, we will attach the integrations.yml nav to it because: the top level path in the integrations.yml matches the beginning of the auto index page path: title: Integrations path: /docs/integrations Copy matches this auto index page path: /docs/integrations /amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list Copy",

High security mode version 1 ensures the following for your account: Feature Comments Requires agents to use a secure connection (HTTPS) High security mode requires an encrypted connection (HTTPS). Non-secure connection attempts will be rejected. The latest version of all New Relic agents support HTTPS. If the configuration is not set appropriately, the agent will override the property to ensure that all data in transit is encrypted as per the latest industry standards. Prevents HTTP param capture Agents configured to capture HTTP params, which may contain sensitive customer data, are not allowed to connect to New Relic. If the local configuration is set to capture request parameters, then New Relic's collector will reject the connection, and the agent will shut down. Prevents raw query statement capture Agents configured to capture raw database query statements, which may contain sensitive customer data, are not allowed to connect to New Relic. If the agent is configured to capture raw queries locally or through server-side configuration, New Relic's collector will reject the connection and the agent will shut down. Prevents deploying Custom Instrumentation via CIE High security mode does not allow deploying custom instrumentation when using the Custom Instrumentation Editor. If you have high security mode enabled, you must export the instrumentation and manually import it to your app server. Migrate from version 1 to version 2 These are the main differences between the two versions of high security: In order to make high security even more secure, high security must be enabled in the New Relic user interface and in the local New Relic configuration file. High security v1 only required high security to be set in the New Relic UI. User attributes, noticeError attributes, and message queue parameters are turned off with high security in version 2, but not in version 1. To update from v1 to v2, add high_security: true to your local agent configuration file.",

Please reach out to the engineering team if that is not enough. Configuration file options When you're changing the navigation, keep in mind that each node in the .yml configuration file can have the following properties: Key Required? Description title yes The text that is shown in the navigation. path * no The URL path to the page. Do not use trailing slashes. * Adding a path is required to generate auto index page content. See path requirements below. children no Any sub-navigation nodes. When the user goes to a page, we determine which section of the site they are on and load the appropriate .yml file to populate the sidebar navigation. The navigation for the homepage is an aggregate of all the top-level pages. Tip Each category has its own index.md page (list of pages for that category). When updating the navigation, you may also want to update these pages to reflect the new information architecture more correctly. Use nav YAML to generate auto index content On build we automatically generate an index page for each sub-directory in src/content that does not already have an index.mdx file and that has at least one .mdx or .md file in it. When creating the page we look through each nav YAML file for a reference to the path to know which nav data to use for the left nav and the auto index page content. If an index page path is in more than one nav YAML file, we use the nav that matches its top level path with the beginning of index page path. Nav requirements for auto index pages In order to populate the auto index page with nav YAML data, you must add the index page path somewhere in the most relevant nav YAML file. This helps the auto index page plugin determine which nav to attach to the index page, but also helps the <IndexContents /> component know which section to display on the index page itself. Each nav item must reference a directory path in src/content that contains at least one .md or .mdx file (otherwise the auto index plugin does not create a page for it). Example If this auto index page is used in full-stack-observability.yml and integrations.yml, we will attach the integrations.yml nav to it because: the top level path in the integrations.yml matches the beginning of the auto index page path: title: Integrations path: /docs/integrations Copy matches this auto index page path: /docs/integrations /amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list Copy",

Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change automatically applies to all New Relic APM agents, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings not available from the UI. Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly within the New Relic UI, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you utilize environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

      "body": "This document contains the configuration options for the APM .NET agent. Configuration overview APM agent configuration options allow you to control some aspects of how the agent behaves. Some of these config options are part of the basic install process (like setting your license key and app name), but most are more advanced settings, such as: setting a log level, setting up proxy host access, excluding certain attributes, and enabling distributed tracing. The .NET agent gets its configuration from the newrelic.config file, which is generated as part of the install process. By default, only a global newrelic.config file is created, but you can also create app-local newrelic.config files for finer control over a multi-app system. Other ways to set config options include: using environment variables, or setting server-side configuration from the UI. For more on the various config options and what overrides what, see Config settings precedence. Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core use the same configuration options and have the same APM features, unless otherwise stated. If you make changes to the config file and want to validate that it's in the right format, you can check it against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows) with any XSD validator. Important For IIS: after you change your newrelic.config or app.config file, perform an IISRESET from an administrative command prompt. Log level adjustments do not require a reset. Configuration methods and precedence levels Upon installation, the .NET agent's configuration file (newrelic.config) applies to all monitored applications, but you can configure the agent in other ways. Here's a diagram showing how different configuration options take precedence over one another: This diagram explains the order of precedence for different ways you might configure the .NET agent. Here are details about the configuration methods shown in the diagram, and their precedence levels: .NET configuration Details and precedence web.config or app.config or appsettings.json Configuration settings set in these files take highest precedence. However, if the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Environment variables Second-highest precedence. For more about these, see .NET environment variables. Server-side configuration Third-highest precedence. A limited number of server-side configuration settings are available; the other settings will come from other configuration sources. App-local newrelic.config Fourth-highest precedence. You can create app-local newrelic.config files to configure individual apps on a multi-app system. These local configuration files override settings in the global newrelic.config file. The agent looks for app-local config files in the following directories, in this order: A directory specified in your web.config or app.config file with the NewRelic.ConfigFile property The web app's root directory (with the app.config or web.config) The directory containing your app's executable file Note that the app-local config file must be complete and validate against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows). Default (global) newrelic.config Default source and the lowest precedence. Will configure all applications on a host in the absence of other config files. The global config file is located in the New Relic agent home directory: %PROGRAMDATA%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent Required environment variables New Relic's .NET agent relies on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to attach New Relic to your processes. Some .NET agent install procedures (like the MSI installer) will automatically set these variables for you; some procedures will require you to manually set them. Caution Security recommendation: You should consider what users can set system environment variables. You should also secure the accounts under which your applications execute to prevent user environment variables overriding system environment variables .NET Framework environment variables For .NET Framework, the following variables are required: COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. .NET Core environment variables For .NET Core, the following variables are required: Linux: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path/to/agent/directory CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=\"${CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME}/libNewRelicProfiler.so\" Copy Windows: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. If your system has previously used monitoring services (non-New Relic), you may have a \"profiler conflict\" when trying to install and use the New Relic agent. More details: Profiler conflict explanation New Relic’s .NET agents rely on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to load New Relic into your processes. The install-related environment variables are Microsoft variables, not New Relic variables. They can be used by other .NET profilers, and only one profiler can be attached to a process at a time. For this reason, if you have used previous application monitoring products, you may have profiler conflicts. For specific install instructions, see the .NET agent install documentation. Optional environment variables Some configuration options in New Relic's .NET agent can be set via environment variables as an alternative to setting them in a config file. Below is a list of environment variables recognized by the .NET agent with example values. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false NEW_RELIC_LABELS=foo:bar;zip:zap NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY=path\\to\\agent\\directory (not configurable via config file) Copy Setup options, newrelic.config Use these options to setup and configure your agent via the newrelic.config file. The New Relic .NET agent supports the following categories of setup options: Configuration element Service element Obscuring key element Proxy element Log element Application element (configuration) Data transmission element Host name Configuration element The root element of the configuration document is a configuration element. <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\" agentEnabled=\"true\" maxStackTraceLines=\"50\" timingPrecision=\"low\"> Copy The configuration element supports the following attributes: agentEnabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the New Relic agent. maxStackTraceLines Type Integer Default 80 The maximum number of stack frames to trace in any stack dump. timingPrecision Type String Default low Controls the precision of the timers. High precision will provide better data, but at a lower execution speed. Possible values are high and low. Service element The first child of the configuration element is a service element. The service element configures the agent's connection to the New Relic service. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" sendEnvironmentInfo=\"true\" syncStartup=\"false\" sendDataOnExit=\"false\" sendDataOnExitThreshold=\"60000\" autoStart=\"true\"/> Copy The service element supports the following attributes: licenseKey (required) Type String Default (none) Your New Relic license key. New Relic uses the license key to match your app's data to the correct account in the UI. Set the license key via environment variable. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX Copy sendEnvironmentInfo Type Boolean Default true Instructs the agent to record execution environment information. Environment information includes operating system, agent version, and which assemblies are available. syncStartup Type Boolean Default false Block application startup until the agent connects to New Relic. If set to true, the first transaction may take substantially longer to complete, because it is blocked until the connection to New Relic is finished. sendDataOnExit Type Boolean Default false Block application shutdown until the agent sends all data from the latest harvest cycle. sendDataOnExitThreshold Type Integer Default 60000 Unit Milliseconds The minimum amount of time the process must run before the agent blocks it from shutting down. This setting only applies when sendDataOnExit is true. completeTransactionsOnThread Type Boolean Default false If false, the agent uses a pool thread to complete the transaction processing. If true, the agent will complete transaction processing on the request thread. requestTimeout Type Integer Default 2000 (sendDataOnExit enabled) 120000 (sendDataOnExit disabled) Unit Milliseconds The agent's request timeout when communicating with New Relic. autoStart Type Boolean Default True Automatically start the .NET agent when the first instrumented method is hit. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true The option to disable SSL is valid only for .NET agent versions 7.x and earlier. .NET agent version 8.x and higher communicate only via SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. Obscuring key element The obscuringKey element is an optional child of the service element. The .NET Agent uses this value to deobfuscate supported configuration values. For example, when an obfuscated proxy password is supplied, it will be deobfuscated using this key. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <obscuringKey>OBSCURING_KEY</obscuringKey> </service> Copy The obscuring key may also be configured by setting the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY environment variable. Caution Security recommendation: The placement of the obscuring Key in the same configuration file as an obfuscated value may pose a security risk. Consider placing the obscuring key in an environment variable and limiting access to environment variables within your environment. Proxy element The proxy element is an optional child of the service element. The proxy element is used when the agent communicates to the New Relic back-end service via a proxy. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <proxy host=\"hostname\" port=\"PROXY_PORT\" uriPath=\"path/to/something.aspx\" domain=\"mydomain.com\" user=\"PROXY_USERNAME\" password=\"PROXY_PASSWORD\" passwordObfuscated=\"OBFUSCATED_PROXY_PASSWORD\"/> </service> Copy The proxy element supports the following attributes: host Type String Default (none) Defines the proxy host. port Type Integer Default 8080 Defines the proxy port. uriPath Type String Default (none) Optionally define a proxy URI path. domain Type String Default (none) Optionally define a domain to use when authenticating with the proxy server. user Type String Default (none) Optionally define a user name for authentication. password Type String Default (none) Optionally define a password for authentication. passwordObfuscated Type String Default (none) For additional security, the .NET Agent supports the use of an obfuscated proxy password with the passwordObfuscated attribute. The obfuscated proxy password is generated using the following New Relic CLI command: newrelic agent config obfuscate --key OBSCURING_KEY --value \"CLEAR_TEXT_PROXY_PASSWORD\" Copy Important When using an obfuscated proxy password, the obscuring key must also be configured. Log element The log element is a child of the configuration element. The log element configures New Relic's logging . The agent generates its own log file to keep its logging information separate from your application's logs. <log level=\"info\" auditLog=\"false\" console=\"false\" directory=\"PATH\\TO\\LOG\\DIRECTORY\" fileName=\"FILENAME.log\" /> Copy The log element supports the following attributes: level Type String Default info Defines the level of detail recorded in the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: off error warn info debug finest all Important Increasing the log level will increase New Relic's performance impact. auditLog Type Boolean Default false Records all data sent to and received from New Relic in both an auditlog log file and the standard log file. console Type Boolean Default false Send log messages to the console, in addition to the log file. directory Type String Default C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs The directory to hold log files generated by the agent. If this is omitted, then a directory named logs in the New Relic agent install area will be used by default. fileName Type String Default (none) Defines a name for the log file. If you do not define a fileName, the name is derived from the name of the monitored process. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log Copy Application element (required) The application element is a child of the configuration element. This required element defines your application name, and disables or enables sampling. name Type String Default My Application The name of your .NET application is a child of the application element. New Relic will aggregate your data according to this name. For example, if you have two running applications named AppA and AppB, you will see two applications in the New Relic interface: AppA and AppB. You can also assign up to three names to your app. The first name is the primary name. For example: <application> <name>MY APPLICATION PRIMARY</name> <name>SECOND APP NAME</name> <name>THIRD APP NAME</name> </application> Copy Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name Copy disableSamplers Type Boolean Default false Samplers collect information about memory and CPU consumption. Set this to true to disable sampling. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true Copy Data transmission element The dataTransmission element is a child of the configuration element. This element affects how data is sent to New Relic and can be used if you have specific data transmission requirements. <dataTransmission putForDataSend=\"false\" compressedContentEncoding=\"deflate\"/> Copy The dataTransmission element supports the following attributes: putForDataSend Type Boolean Default false Defines the HTTP method used when sending data to New Relic. Set this to true to enable using the PUT method when sending data. The POST method is used by default. Host name If the default host name label in the APM UI is not useful, you can decorate that name in the New Relic UI with a display name. After the application process is restarted and the .NET agent is reporting again, the display name will appear in the Servers drop-down list. This host name setting does not affect the list of hosts on your application's Summary page. To set a display name, choose one of the following options. The environment variable takes precedence over the config file value. Then restart your application to see your changes in the New Relic UI. Set using config file Set the displayName attribute in the processHost element in newrelic.config. The processHost element is a child of the configuration element. <configuration . . . > <processHost displayName=\"CUSTOM_NAME\" /> </configuration> Copy Set using environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME environment variable: NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME = \"CUSTOM_NAME\" Copy Cloud platform utilization Configures the utilization configuration element to control how the agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service to determine pricing. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances, Docker containers, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and Kubernetes. detectAws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detectAzure Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Azure metadata API. detectGcp Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls GCP metadata API. detectPcf Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls PCF information from environment variables. detectDocker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. detectKubernetes Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Kubernetes information from environment variables. Instrumentation options Use these options to configure which elements of your application and environment to instrument. New Relic for .NET supports the following categories of instrumentation options: Instrumentation element Applications element (instrumentation) Attributes element Instrumentation element The instrumentation element is a child of the configuration element. By default, the .NET agent instruments IIS asp worker processes and Azure web and worker roles. To instrument other processes, see Instrumenting custom applications. Applications element (instrumentation) The applications element is a child of the instrumentation element. The applications element specifies which non-web apps to instrument. It contains a name attribute. Important This is not the same as the application (configuration) element, which is a child of the configuration element. <instrumentation> <applications> <application name=\"MyService1.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService2.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService3.exe\" /> </applications> </instrumentation> Copy Attributes element An attribute is a key/value pair that determines the properties of an event or transaction. Each attribute is sent to APM transaction traces, APM error traces, Transaction events, TransactionError events, or PageView events. The primary attributes element enables or disables attribute collection for the .NET agent, and defines specific attributes to collect or exclude. You can also configure attribute settings based on their destination: Error collection, transaction traces, Browser instrumentation, and transaction events. In this example, the agent excludes all attributes whose key begins with myApiKey (myApiKey.bar, myApiKey.value), but collects the custom attribute myApiKey.foo. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> Copy You can view the .NET APM attributes on the .NET agent attributes page. You can also define custom attributes with the agent API call AddCustomParameter. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable attribute collection. When set to false in the primary attribute element, this setting overrides all attribute settings for individual destinations. include Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will collect all attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. exclude Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will not collect attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. Feature options Use these options to enable, disable, and configure New Relic features. New Relic for .NET allows you to configure the following features: App pools Cross application traces Error collection High security mode Strip exception messages Transaction events Custom events Custom parameters Tags/labels Browser instrumentation Slow Queries Transaction traces Datastore tracer Distributed tracing Span events App pools Important This is only applicable to a system's global config file. The applicationPools element is a child of the configuration element. The applicationPools element specifies for the profiler exactly which application pools to instrument and uses the same name as the IIS application pool name. This configuration element is useful when you may need to instrument only a small subset of your app pools. For example, a given server might have several hundred application pools, but only a few of those pools need to be instrumented by the .NET agent. Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"false\"/> </applicationPools> Copy Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for all application pools currently executing on the server and enabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <defaultBehavior instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"true\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"true\"/> </applicationPools> Copy The applicationPools element supports the following elements: defaultBehavior Type Boolean Default false Defines how the .NET agent will behave on a \"global\" level for application pools served via IIS. The .NET agent instruments all application pools by default. When true, application pools listed under applicationPool with an instrument attribute set to false will not be instrumented. Essentially, when set to false, the application pool list acts as an allow list. When set to true, the application pool list acts as a deny list. applicationPool Defines instrumentation behavior for a specific application pool. The name attribute is the name of an application pool. Enable or disable profiling in the instrument attribute. Define this application in the name attribute. Cross application traces The crossApplicationTracer element is a child of the configuration element. crossApplicationTracer links transaction traces across applications. When linked in a service-oriented architecture, all instrumented applications that communicate with each other via HTTP will now \"link\" transaction traces with the applications that they call and the applications they are called by. Cross application tracing makes it easier to understand the performance relationship between services and applications. <crossApplicationTracer enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The crossApplicationTracer element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable cross application tracing Error collection The errorCollector element is a child of the configuration element. errorCollector configures error collection, which captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic. <errorCollector enabled=\"true\" captureEvents=\"true\" maxEventSamplesStored=\"100\"> <ignoreClasses> <errorClass>System.IO.FileNotFoundException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.Threading.ThreadAbortException</errorClass> </ignoreClasses> <ignoreMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Ignore message</message> <message>Ignore too</message> </errorClass> </ignoreMessages> <ignoreStatusCodes> <code>401</code> <code>404</code> </ignoreStatusCodes> <expectedClasses> <errorClass>System.ArgumentNullException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException</errorClass> </expectedClasses> <expectedMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Expected message</message> <message>Expected too</message> </errorClass> </expectedMessages> <expectedStatusCodes>403,500-505</expectedStatusCodes> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </errorCollector> Copy Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. The errorCollector element supports the following elements and attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the error collector. captureEvents Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capturing of error events. maxEventSamplesStored Type Integer Default 100 Reservoir limit for error events. ignoreClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be ignored. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreErrors (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Lists specific exceptions to not report to New Relic. The full name of the exception should be used, such as System.IO.FileNotFoundException. ignoreStatusCodes Type String Default (none) Lists specific HTTP error codes to not report to New Relic. You can use standard integral HTTP error codes, such as just 401, or you may use Microsoft full status codes with decimal points, such as 401.4 or 403.18. The status codes should be equal to or greater than 400. expectedClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be marked as expected. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedStatusCodes A comma separated list of status codes. The list may include integer ranges, using a single dash (-) and will be inclusive of both the starting and ending integer in the range. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for error traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. High security mode The highSecurity element is a child of the configuration element. To enable high security mode, set this property to true and enable high security property in the New Relic user interface. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request parameters and custom parameters are not collected, strip exception messages is enabled, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable high security mode. Example: <highSecurity enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Strip exception messages The stripExceptionMessages element is a child of the configuration element. To enable strip exception messages, set this property to true. By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically changed to true, and the agent strips the messages from exceptions. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable strip exception messages. Example: <stripExceptionMessages enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Transaction events The transactionEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use transactionEvents to configure transaction events. <transactionEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionEvents> Copy The transactionEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to transaction events. Attribute settings can be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Caution When distributed tracing and/or Infinite Tracing are enabled, information from transaction events is applied to the root Span Event of the transaction. Consider applying any attribute settings for transaction events to span events and/or apply them as Global Attribute settings. Custom events The customEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use customEvents to configure custom events. <customEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"/> Copy The CustomEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy Custom parameters The customParameters element is a child of the configuration element. Use customParameters to configure custom parameters. <customParameters enabled=\"true\" /> Copy The CustomParameters element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capture of custom parameters. Labels (tags) The labels element is a child of the configuration element. This sets tag names and values. The list is a semicolon delimited list of colon-separated name and value pairs. You can also use with the NEW_RELIC_LABELS environment variable. Example: <labels>foo:bar;zip:zap</labels> Copy Browser instrumentation The browserMonitoring element is a child of the configuration element. browserMonitoring configures Browser monitoring in your .NET application. Browser gives you insight your end users' performance experience. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your webpages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. // If you use both the Exclude and Attribute elements // the Exclude element must be listed first. <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </browserMonitoring> Copy The browserMonitoring element supports the following attributes: autoInstrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically injects the Browser agent JavaScript. To turn off automatic injection, set this attribute to false. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for Browser. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. requestPathsExcluded Use this sub-element to prevent the Browser agent from being injected in specific pages. The element is used as follows: <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> Copy The agent will not inject the Browser agent into pages whose URL matches one of the specified regular expressions. The regular expression should follow Microsoft guidelines for the Regex class. It is a reference to the virtual directory of the path in your application and not the full URL of the path you wish to exclude. For example, to exclude the pages in https://www.mywebsite.com/mywebpages/ you would simply insert /mywebpages/ as the path regex value. The requestPathsExcluded element should be used in cases where it is impossible or undesirable to use the DisableBrowserMonitoring() call. To minimize a possible performance impact try to use as few regular expressions as possible and keep them as simple as possible. Slow queries The slowSql element is a child of the configuration element. slowSql configures capturing information about slow query executions, and captures and obfuscates explain plans for these queries. <slowSql enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The slowSql element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable slow query tracing. Transaction traces The transactionTracer element is a child of the configuration element. transactionTracer configures transaction traces. Included in the trace is the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. <transactionTracer enabled=\"true\" transactionThreshold=\"apdex_f\" recordSql=\"obfuscated\" explainEnabled=\"true\" explainThreshold=\"500\" maxSegments=\"3000\" maxExplainPlans=\"20\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionTracer> Copy The transactionTracer element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable transaction traces. transactionThreshold Type String Default apdex_f Defines the threshold for transaction traces. If a transaction takes longer than the threshold, it is eligible for being traced. See transaction trace basics for more about the rules governing traces. The default value is apdex_f, which sets the threshold to four times the application's apdex_t value. For more information about apdex_t, see Apdex. You can also set the threshold to be a specific time value in milliseconds. recordSql Type String Default obfuscated Select a query tracing policy. Options are off, which records nothing; obfuscated, which records an obfuscated version of the query; or raw, which records the query exactly as it is issued to the database. Caution Recording raw queries may capture sensitive information. explainEnabled Type Boolean Default false When true, the agent captures EXPLAIN statements for slow queries. explainThreshold Type Integer Default 500 Unit Milliseconds The agent collects slow query data for queries that exceed this threshold, along with any available explain plans, as part of transaction traces. maxSegments Type Integer Default 3000 The maximum number of segments to collect in a transaction trace. maxExplainPlans Type Integer Default 20 The maximum number of explain plans to collect during a harvest cycle. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Datastore tracer The datastoreTracer element is a child of the configuration element. <datastoreTracer> <instanceReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <databaseNameReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <queryParameters enabled=\"false\" /> </datastoreTracer> Copy The datastoreTracer element supports the following sub-elements: instanceReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. databaseNameReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. The default value of attribute enabled is true. queryParameters Use this sub-element to enable collection of the SQL query parameters on slow query traces. The default value of attribute enabled is false. Caution Recording query parameters may capture sensitive information. The transactionTracer.recordSql configuration option must be set to raw or this option is ignored. Distributed tracing The distributedTracing element is a child of the configuration element. <distributedTracing enabled=\"false\" excludeNewrelicHeader=\"false\"/> Copy Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the planning guide. Important Requires .NET agent version 8.6.45.0 or higher. The distributedTracing element supports the following attributes: To enable or disable, see Enable distributed tracing. enabled Type Boolean Default false Alternatively, enable distributed tracing via the NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true Copy excludeNewrelicHeader Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing reports span events. Span event reporting is enabled by default, but distributed tracing must be enabled for spans to be reported. To disable span events, choose one of the following options: Disable span events via config file Set the <spanEvents> element to false to disable via the newrelic.config file. This element is a child of the <configuration> element. <configuration . . . > <spanEvents enabled=\"false\" /> </configuration> Copy Disable span events via environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false Copy Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing extends the distributed tracing service by employing a trace observer that is external to the agent. It observes 100% of your application traces across various services and provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. Important Infinite Tracing requires .NET Agent version 8.30 or higher. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional settings below <configuration . . . > <distributedTracing enabled=\"true\" /> <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer host=\"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" /> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy The infiniteTracing element supports the following elements: trace_observer The trace_observer element identifies an observer host that is independent from the agent. For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint. The trace observer may be configured using the NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST environment variable as well. Important When configuring the trace observer, you should not supply the protocol as part of the host. For example, use myhost.infinitetracing.com instead of https://myhost.infinitetracing.com. Span events The spanEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use spanEvents to configure span events. <spanEvents enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </spanEvents> Copy The spanEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for span events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to span events. Attribute settings may be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Settings in app.config or web.config For ASP.NET and .NET Framework console apps you can also configure the following settings in your app's app.config or web.config, within the outermost element, <configuration>: Enable and disable the agent <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"false\" /> </appSettings> Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AppName\" value =\"Descriptive Name\" /> </appSettings> Copy License key <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\" value =\"XXXXXXXX\" /> </appSettings> Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\" value=\"C:\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\newrelic.config\" /> </appSettings> Copy Settings in appsettings.json For .NET Core apps, you can configure the following settings in appsettings.json if the following is true: The appsettings.json file must be located in the current working directory of the application. The application must have the following dependencies: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.EnvironmentVariables Enable and disable the agent { \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\":\"false\" } Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled setting in this file will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. { \"NewRelic.AppName\": \"Descriptive Name\" } Copy License key { \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\": \"XXXXXXXX\" } Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. { \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\": \"C:\\\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\\\newrelic.config\" } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation allows you to instrument parts of your app that are not instrumented automatically. This document describes how to instrument your app by decorating the methods in your app code with attributes. Use the Transaction attribute to create a custom transaction. You can also mark the custom transaction as a web transaction with the attribute's Web property. Use the Trace attribute to add custom instrumentation to methods that are invoked within a preexisting transaction. Requirements and recommendations Requirements include: .NET agent version 6.16.178.0 or higher. You must be willing to modify your source code. If you cannot or do not want to modify your source code, use custom instrumentation via XML. Your project must have a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll (for example, installing the package and placing using NewRelic.Api.Agent; in your code). This package is in the NuGet gallery. The Transaction and Trace attributes must be applied to concrete implementations of methods. They cannot be applied on interfaces or super class method definitions. Transactions called within transactions Methods decorated with the [Transaction] attribute will only create a new transaction when one does not already exist. When a method decorated with [Transaction] is called from within a previously started transaction, it will be treated as the [Trace] attribute instead, and will provide more information about the existing transaction. Example: Calling Transaction in an already-started transaction During the execution of this console application, OuterMethod will be called first and create a new transaction. The InnerMethod is called from within the transaction started by OuterMethod, so it will not create a new transaction. Instead, information about the execution of InnerMethod will be tracked as if the [Trace] attribute had been applied. static void Main(string[] args) { OuterMethod(); } [Transaction] public void OuterMethod() { InnerMethod(); } [Transaction] public void InnerMethod() { } Copy Create a new non-web transaction To start a non-web transaction (also known as a background request) with the Transaction attribute: [Transaction] public void Run() { // your background task } Copy For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Create a new web transaction To tell the agent to mark a non-web task as a web browser transaction, use either of these options: Set the Web property of the Transaction attribute to true. Set the transaction's URI with SetTransactionUri(). [Transaction(Web = true)] public void Run() { var uri = new Uri(\"http://www.mydomain.com/path\"); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.SetTransactionUri(uri); // your web task } Copy When used inside a previously started transaction, this will be treated as a [Trace] attribute. For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Add detail to existing transactions with Trace If your transaction traces show large blocks of un-instrumented time and you want to include additional methods within the trace, you can use the Trace attribute: [Trace] protected void MethodWithinTransaction() { // your app code } Copy Properties for [ Transaction] The Transaction attribute supports the following properties: Web Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent starts a web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. If a transaction is in progress, then that transaction will continue. If false (default), the agent starts a non-web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. For example: [Transaction(Web = true)] Copy Read forum posts about instrumentation For more specific recommendations, check out these posts in our Explorers Hub community: Troubleshoot attribute-based custom instrumentation issues Build custom instrumentation tracer factories from .NET agent log files Use other API functions For more about the .NET agent API and its functionality, see New Relic's .NET agent API guide.

      "body": "This document contains the configuration options for the APM .NET agent. Configuration overview APM agent configuration options allow you to control some aspects of how the agent behaves. Some of these config options are part of the basic install process (like setting your license key and app name), but most are more advanced settings, such as: setting a log level, setting up proxy host access, excluding certain attributes, and enabling distributed tracing. The .NET agent gets its configuration from the newrelic.config file, which is generated as part of the install process. By default, only a global newrelic.config file is created, but you can also create app-local newrelic.config files for finer control over a multi-app system. Other ways to set config options include: using environment variables, or setting server-side configuration from the UI. For more on the various config options and what overrides what, see Config settings precedence. Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core use the same configuration options and have the same APM features, unless otherwise stated. If you make changes to the config file and want to validate that it's in the right format, you can check it against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows) with any XSD validator. Important For IIS: after you change your newrelic.config or app.config file, perform an IISRESET from an administrative command prompt. Log level adjustments do not require a reset. Configuration methods and precedence levels Upon installation, the .NET agent's configuration file (newrelic.config) applies to all monitored applications, but you can configure the agent in other ways. Here's a diagram showing how different configuration options take precedence over one another: This diagram explains the order of precedence for different ways you might configure the .NET agent. Here are details about the configuration methods shown in the diagram, and their precedence levels: .NET configuration Details and precedence web.config or app.config or appsettings.json Configuration settings set in these files take highest precedence. However, if the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Environment variables Second-highest precedence. For more about these, see .NET environment variables. Server-side configuration Third-highest precedence. A limited number of server-side configuration settings are available; the other settings will come from other configuration sources. App-local newrelic.config Fourth-highest precedence. You can create app-local newrelic.config files to configure individual apps on a multi-app system. These local configuration files override settings in the global newrelic.config file. The agent looks for app-local config files in the following directories, in this order: A directory specified in your web.config or app.config file with the NewRelic.ConfigFile property The web app's root directory (with the app.config or web.config) The directory containing your app's executable file Note that the app-local config file must be complete and validate against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows). Default (global) newrelic.config Default source and the lowest precedence. Will configure all applications on a host in the absence of other config files. The global config file is located in the New Relic agent home directory: %PROGRAMDATA%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent Required environment variables New Relic's .NET agent relies on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to attach New Relic to your processes. Some .NET agent install procedures (like the MSI installer) will automatically set these variables for you; some procedures will require you to manually set them. Caution Security recommendation: You should consider what users can set system environment variables. You should also secure the accounts under which your applications execute to prevent user environment variables overriding system environment variables .NET Framework environment variables For .NET Framework, the following variables are required: COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. .NET Core environment variables For .NET Core, the following variables are required: Linux: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path/to/agent/directory CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=\"${CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME}/libNewRelicProfiler.so\" Copy Windows: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. If your system has previously used monitoring services (non-New Relic), you may have a \"profiler conflict\" when trying to install and use the New Relic agent. More details: Profiler conflict explanation New Relic’s .NET agents rely on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to load New Relic into your processes. The install-related environment variables are Microsoft variables, not New Relic variables. They can be used by other .NET profilers, and only one profiler can be attached to a process at a time. For this reason, if you have used previous application monitoring products, you may have profiler conflicts. For specific install instructions, see the .NET agent install documentation. Optional environment variables Some configuration options in New Relic's .NET agent can be set via environment variables as an alternative to setting them in a config file. Below is a list of environment variables recognized by the .NET agent with example values. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false NEW_RELIC_LABELS=foo:bar;zip:zap NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY=path\\to\\agent\\directory (not configurable via config file) Copy Setup options, newrelic.config Use these options to setup and configure your agent via the newrelic.config file. The New Relic .NET agent supports the following categories of setup options: Configuration element Service element Obscuring key element Proxy element Log element Application element (configuration) Data transmission element Host name Configuration element The root element of the configuration document is a configuration element. <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\" agentEnabled=\"true\" maxStackTraceLines=\"50\" timingPrecision=\"low\"> Copy The configuration element supports the following attributes: agentEnabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the New Relic agent. maxStackTraceLines Type Integer Default 80 The maximum number of stack frames to trace in any stack dump. timingPrecision Type String Default low Controls the precision of the timers. High precision will provide better data, but at a lower execution speed. Possible values are high and low. Service element The first child of the configuration element is a service element. The service element configures the agent's connection to the New Relic service. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" sendEnvironmentInfo=\"true\" syncStartup=\"false\" sendDataOnExit=\"false\" sendDataOnExitThreshold=\"60000\" autoStart=\"true\"/> Copy The service element supports the following attributes: licenseKey (required) Type String Default (none) Your New Relic license key. New Relic uses the license key to match your app's data to the correct account in the UI. Set the license key via environment variable. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX Copy sendEnvironmentInfo Type Boolean Default true Instructs the agent to record execution environment information. Environment information includes operating system, agent version, and which assemblies are available. syncStartup Type Boolean Default false Block application startup until the agent connects to New Relic. If set to true, the first transaction may take substantially longer to complete, because it is blocked until the connection to New Relic is finished. sendDataOnExit Type Boolean Default false Block application shutdown until the agent sends all data from the latest harvest cycle. sendDataOnExitThreshold Type Integer Default 60000 Unit Milliseconds The minimum amount of time the process must run before the agent blocks it from shutting down. This setting only applies when sendDataOnExit is true. completeTransactionsOnThread Type Boolean Default false If false, the agent uses a pool thread to complete the transaction processing. If true, the agent will complete transaction processing on the request thread. requestTimeout Type Integer Default 2000 (sendDataOnExit enabled) 120000 (sendDataOnExit disabled) Unit Milliseconds The agent's request timeout when communicating with New Relic. autoStart Type Boolean Default True Automatically start the .NET agent when the first instrumented method is hit. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true The option to disable SSL is valid only for .NET agent versions 7.x and earlier. .NET agent version 8.x and higher communicate only via SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. Obscuring key element The obscuringKey element is an optional child of the service element. The .NET Agent uses this value to deobfuscate supported configuration values. For example, when an obfuscated proxy password is supplied, it will be deobfuscated using this key. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <obscuringKey>OBSCURING_KEY</obscuringKey> </service> Copy The obscuring key may also be configured by setting the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY environment variable. Caution Security recommendation: The placement of the obscuring Key in the same configuration file as an obfuscated value may pose a security risk. Consider placing the obscuring key in an environment variable and limiting access to environment variables within your environment. Proxy element The proxy element is an optional child of the service element. The proxy element is used when the agent communicates to the New Relic back-end service via a proxy. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <proxy host=\"hostname\" port=\"PROXY_PORT\" uriPath=\"path/to/something.aspx\" domain=\"mydomain.com\" user=\"PROXY_USERNAME\" password=\"PROXY_PASSWORD\" passwordObfuscated=\"OBFUSCATED_PROXY_PASSWORD\"/> </service> Copy The proxy element supports the following attributes: host Type String Default (none) Defines the proxy host. port Type Integer Default 8080 Defines the proxy port. uriPath Type String Default (none) Optionally define a proxy URI path. domain Type String Default (none) Optionally define a domain to use when authenticating with the proxy server. user Type String Default (none) Optionally define a user name for authentication. password Type String Default (none) Optionally define a password for authentication. passwordObfuscated Type String Default (none) For additional security, the .NET Agent supports the use of an obfuscated proxy password with the passwordObfuscated attribute. The obfuscated proxy password is generated using the following New Relic CLI command: newrelic agent config obfuscate --key OBSCURING_KEY --value \"CLEAR_TEXT_PROXY_PASSWORD\" Copy Important When using an obfuscated proxy password, the obscuring key must also be configured. Log element The log element is a child of the configuration element. The log element configures New Relic's logging . The agent generates its own log file to keep its logging information separate from your application's logs. <log level=\"info\" auditLog=\"false\" console=\"false\" directory=\"PATH\\TO\\LOG\\DIRECTORY\" fileName=\"FILENAME.log\" /> Copy The log element supports the following attributes: level Type String Default info Defines the level of detail recorded in the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: off error warn info debug finest all Important Increasing the log level will increase New Relic's performance impact. auditLog Type Boolean Default false Records all data sent to and received from New Relic in both an auditlog log file and the standard log file. console Type Boolean Default false Send log messages to the console, in addition to the log file. directory Type String Default C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs The directory to hold log files generated by the agent. If this is omitted, then a directory named logs in the New Relic agent install area will be used by default. fileName Type String Default (none) Defines a name for the log file. If you do not define a fileName, the name is derived from the name of the monitored process. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log Copy Application element (required) The application element is a child of the configuration element. This required element defines your application name, and disables or enables sampling. name Type String Default My Application The name of your .NET application is a child of the application element. New Relic will aggregate your data according to this name. For example, if you have two running applications named AppA and AppB, you will see two applications in the New Relic interface: AppA and AppB. You can also assign up to three names to your app. The first name is the primary name. For example: <application> <name>MY APPLICATION PRIMARY</name> <name>SECOND APP NAME</name> <name>THIRD APP NAME</name> </application> Copy Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name Copy disableSamplers Type Boolean Default false Samplers collect information about memory and CPU consumption. Set this to true to disable sampling. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true Copy Data transmission element The dataTransmission element is a child of the configuration element. This element affects how data is sent to New Relic and can be used if you have specific data transmission requirements. <dataTransmission putForDataSend=\"false\" compressedContentEncoding=\"deflate\"/> Copy The dataTransmission element supports the following attributes: putForDataSend Type Boolean Default false Defines the HTTP method used when sending data to New Relic. Set this to true to enable using the PUT method when sending data. The POST method is used by default. Host name If the default host name label in the APM UI is not useful, you can decorate that name in the New Relic UI with a display name. After the application process is restarted and the .NET agent is reporting again, the display name will appear in the Servers drop-down list. This host name setting does not affect the list of hosts on your application's Summary page. To set a display name, choose one of the following options. The environment variable takes precedence over the config file value. Then restart your application to see your changes in the New Relic UI. Set using config file Set the displayName attribute in the processHost element in newrelic.config. The processHost element is a child of the configuration element. <configuration . . . > <processHost displayName=\"CUSTOM_NAME\" /> </configuration> Copy Set using environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME environment variable: NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME = \"CUSTOM_NAME\" Copy Cloud platform utilization Configures the utilization configuration element to control how the agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service to determine pricing. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances, Docker containers, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and Kubernetes. detectAws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detectAzure Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Azure metadata API. detectGcp Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls GCP metadata API. detectPcf Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls PCF information from environment variables. detectDocker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. detectKubernetes Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Kubernetes information from environment variables. Instrumentation options Use these options to configure which elements of your application and environment to instrument. New Relic for .NET supports the following categories of instrumentation options: Instrumentation element Applications element (instrumentation) Attributes element Instrumentation element The instrumentation element is a child of the configuration element. By default, the .NET agent instruments IIS asp worker processes and Azure web and worker roles. To instrument other processes, see Instrumenting custom applications. Applications element (instrumentation) The applications element is a child of the instrumentation element. The applications element specifies which non-web apps to instrument. It contains a name attribute. Important This is not the same as the application (configuration) element, which is a child of the configuration element. <instrumentation> <applications> <application name=\"MyService1.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService2.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService3.exe\" /> </applications> </instrumentation> Copy Attributes element An attribute is a key/value pair that determines the properties of an event or transaction. Each attribute is sent to APM transaction traces, APM error traces, Transaction events, TransactionError events, or PageView events. The primary attributes element enables or disables attribute collection for the .NET agent, and defines specific attributes to collect or exclude. You can also configure attribute settings based on their destination: Error collection, transaction traces, Browser instrumentation, and transaction events. In this example, the agent excludes all attributes whose key begins with myApiKey (myApiKey.bar, myApiKey.value), but collects the custom attribute myApiKey.foo. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> Copy You can view the .NET APM attributes on the .NET agent attributes page. You can also define custom attributes with the agent API call AddCustomParameter. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable attribute collection. When set to false in the primary attribute element, this setting overrides all attribute settings for individual destinations. include Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will collect all attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. exclude Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will not collect attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. Feature options Use these options to enable, disable, and configure New Relic features. New Relic for .NET allows you to configure the following features: App pools Cross application traces Error collection High security mode Strip exception messages Transaction events Custom events Custom parameters Tags/labels Browser instrumentation Slow Queries Transaction traces Datastore tracer Distributed tracing Span events App pools Important This is only applicable to a system's global config file. The applicationPools element is a child of the configuration element. The applicationPools element specifies for the profiler exactly which application pools to instrument and uses the same name as the IIS application pool name. This configuration element is useful when you may need to instrument only a small subset of your app pools. For example, a given server might have several hundred application pools, but only a few of those pools need to be instrumented by the .NET agent. Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"false\"/> </applicationPools> Copy Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for all application pools currently executing on the server and enabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <defaultBehavior instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"true\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"true\"/> </applicationPools> Copy The applicationPools element supports the following elements: defaultBehavior Type Boolean Default false Defines how the .NET agent will behave on a \"global\" level for application pools served via IIS. The .NET agent instruments all application pools by default. When true, application pools listed under applicationPool with an instrument attribute set to false will not be instrumented. Essentially, when set to false, the application pool list acts as an allow list. When set to true, the application pool list acts as a deny list. applicationPool Defines instrumentation behavior for a specific application pool. The name attribute is the name of an application pool. Enable or disable profiling in the instrument attribute. Define this application in the name attribute. Cross application traces The crossApplicationTracer element is a child of the configuration element. crossApplicationTracer links transaction traces across applications. When linked in a service-oriented architecture, all instrumented applications that communicate with each other via HTTP will now \"link\" transaction traces with the applications that they call and the applications they are called by. Cross application tracing makes it easier to understand the performance relationship between services and applications. <crossApplicationTracer enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The crossApplicationTracer element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable cross application tracing Error collection The errorCollector element is a child of the configuration element. errorCollector configures error collection, which captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic. <errorCollector enabled=\"true\" captureEvents=\"true\" maxEventSamplesStored=\"100\"> <ignoreClasses> <errorClass>System.IO.FileNotFoundException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.Threading.ThreadAbortException</errorClass> </ignoreClasses> <ignoreMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Ignore message</message> <message>Ignore too</message> </errorClass> </ignoreMessages> <ignoreStatusCodes> <code>401</code> <code>404</code> </ignoreStatusCodes> <expectedClasses> <errorClass>System.ArgumentNullException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException</errorClass> </expectedClasses> <expectedMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Expected message</message> <message>Expected too</message> </errorClass> </expectedMessages> <expectedStatusCodes>403,500-505</expectedStatusCodes> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </errorCollector> Copy Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. The errorCollector element supports the following elements and attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the error collector. captureEvents Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capturing of error events. maxEventSamplesStored Type Integer Default 100 Reservoir limit for error events. ignoreClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be ignored. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreErrors (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Lists specific exceptions to not report to New Relic. The full name of the exception should be used, such as System.IO.FileNotFoundException. ignoreStatusCodes Type String Default (none) Lists specific HTTP error codes to not report to New Relic. You can use standard integral HTTP error codes, such as just 401, or you may use Microsoft full status codes with decimal points, such as 401.4 or 403.18. The status codes should be equal to or greater than 400. expectedClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be marked as expected. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedStatusCodes A comma separated list of status codes. The list may include integer ranges, using a single dash (-) and will be inclusive of both the starting and ending integer in the range. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for error traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. High security mode The highSecurity element is a child of the configuration element. To enable high security mode, set this property to true and enable high security property in the New Relic user interface. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request parameters and custom parameters are not collected, strip exception messages is enabled, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable high security mode. Example: <highSecurity enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Strip exception messages The stripExceptionMessages element is a child of the configuration element. To enable strip exception messages, set this property to true. By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically changed to true, and the agent strips the messages from exceptions. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable strip exception messages. Example: <stripExceptionMessages enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Transaction events The transactionEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use transactionEvents to configure transaction events. <transactionEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionEvents> Copy The transactionEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to transaction events. Attribute settings can be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Caution When distributed tracing and/or Infinite Tracing are enabled, information from transaction events is applied to the root Span Event of the transaction. Consider applying any attribute settings for transaction events to span events and/or apply them as Global Attribute settings. Custom events The customEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use customEvents to configure custom events. <customEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"/> Copy The CustomEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy Custom parameters The customParameters element is a child of the configuration element. Use customParameters to configure custom parameters. <customParameters enabled=\"true\" /> Copy The CustomParameters element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capture of custom parameters. Labels (tags) The labels element is a child of the configuration element. This sets tag names and values. The list is a semicolon delimited list of colon-separated name and value pairs. You can also use with the NEW_RELIC_LABELS environment variable. Example: <labels>foo:bar;zip:zap</labels> Copy Browser instrumentation The browserMonitoring element is a child of the configuration element. browserMonitoring configures Browser monitoring in your .NET application. Browser gives you insight your end users' performance experience. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your webpages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. // If you use both the Exclude and Attribute elements // the Exclude element must be listed first. <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </browserMonitoring> Copy The browserMonitoring element supports the following attributes: autoInstrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically injects the Browser agent JavaScript. To turn off automatic injection, set this attribute to false. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for Browser. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. requestPathsExcluded Use this sub-element to prevent the Browser agent from being injected in specific pages. The element is used as follows: <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> Copy The agent will not inject the Browser agent into pages whose URL matches one of the specified regular expressions. The regular expression should follow Microsoft guidelines for the Regex class. It is a reference to the virtual directory of the path in your application and not the full URL of the path you wish to exclude. For example, to exclude the pages in https://www.mywebsite.com/mywebpages/ you would simply insert /mywebpages/ as the path regex value. The requestPathsExcluded element should be used in cases where it is impossible or undesirable to use the DisableBrowserMonitoring() call. To minimize a possible performance impact try to use as few regular expressions as possible and keep them as simple as possible. Slow queries The slowSql element is a child of the configuration element. slowSql configures capturing information about slow query executions, and captures and obfuscates explain plans for these queries. <slowSql enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The slowSql element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable slow query tracing. Transaction traces The transactionTracer element is a child of the configuration element. transactionTracer configures transaction traces. Included in the trace is the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. <transactionTracer enabled=\"true\" transactionThreshold=\"apdex_f\" recordSql=\"obfuscated\" explainEnabled=\"true\" explainThreshold=\"500\" maxSegments=\"3000\" maxExplainPlans=\"20\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionTracer> Copy The transactionTracer element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable transaction traces. transactionThreshold Type String Default apdex_f Defines the threshold for transaction traces. If a transaction takes longer than the threshold, it is eligible for being traced. See transaction trace basics for more about the rules governing traces. The default value is apdex_f, which sets the threshold to four times the application's apdex_t value. For more information about apdex_t, see Apdex. You can also set the threshold to be a specific time value in milliseconds. recordSql Type String Default obfuscated Select a query tracing policy. Options are off, which records nothing; obfuscated, which records an obfuscated version of the query; or raw, which records the query exactly as it is issued to the database. Caution Recording raw queries may capture sensitive information. explainEnabled Type Boolean Default false When true, the agent captures EXPLAIN statements for slow queries. explainThreshold Type Integer Default 500 Unit Milliseconds The agent collects slow query data for queries that exceed this threshold, along with any available explain plans, as part of transaction traces. maxSegments Type Integer Default 3000 The maximum number of segments to collect in a transaction trace. maxExplainPlans Type Integer Default 20 The maximum number of explain plans to collect during a harvest cycle. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Datastore tracer The datastoreTracer element is a child of the configuration element. <datastoreTracer> <instanceReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <databaseNameReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <queryParameters enabled=\"false\" /> </datastoreTracer> Copy The datastoreTracer element supports the following sub-elements: instanceReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. databaseNameReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. The default value of attribute enabled is true. queryParameters Use this sub-element to enable collection of the SQL query parameters on slow query traces. The default value of attribute enabled is false. Caution Recording query parameters may capture sensitive information. The transactionTracer.recordSql configuration option must be set to raw or this option is ignored. Distributed tracing The distributedTracing element is a child of the configuration element. <distributedTracing enabled=\"false\" excludeNewrelicHeader=\"false\"/> Copy Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the planning guide. Important Requires .NET agent version 8.6.45.0 or higher. The distributedTracing element supports the following attributes: To enable or disable, see Enable distributed tracing. enabled Type Boolean Default false Alternatively, enable distributed tracing via the NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true Copy excludeNewrelicHeader Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing reports span events. Span event reporting is enabled by default, but distributed tracing must be enabled for spans to be reported. To disable span events, choose one of the following options: Disable span events via config file Set the <spanEvents> element to false to disable via the newrelic.config file. This element is a child of the <configuration> element. <configuration . . . > <spanEvents enabled=\"false\" /> </configuration> Copy Disable span events via environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false Copy Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing extends the distributed tracing service by employing a trace observer that is external to the agent. It observes 100% of your application traces across various services and provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. Important Infinite Tracing requires .NET Agent version 8.30 or higher. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional settings below <configuration . . . > <distributedTracing enabled=\"true\" /> <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer host=\"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" /> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy The infiniteTracing element supports the following elements: trace_observer The trace_observer element identifies an observer host that is independent from the agent. For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint. The trace observer may be configured using the NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST environment variable as well. Important When configuring the trace observer, you should not supply the protocol as part of the host. For example, use myhost.infinitetracing.com instead of https://myhost.infinitetracing.com. Span events The spanEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use spanEvents to configure span events. <spanEvents enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </spanEvents> Copy The spanEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for span events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to span events. Attribute settings may be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Settings in app.config or web.config For ASP.NET and .NET Framework console apps you can also configure the following settings in your app's app.config or web.config, within the outermost element, <configuration>: Enable and disable the agent <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"false\" /> </appSettings> Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AppName\" value =\"Descriptive Name\" /> </appSettings> Copy License key <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\" value =\"XXXXXXXX\" /> </appSettings> Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\" value=\"C:\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\newrelic.config\" /> </appSettings> Copy Settings in appsettings.json For .NET Core apps, you can configure the following settings in appsettings.json if the following is true: The appsettings.json file must be located in the current working directory of the application. The application must have the following dependencies: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.EnvironmentVariables Enable and disable the agent { \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\":\"false\" } Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled setting in this file will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. { \"NewRelic.AppName\": \"Descriptive Name\" } Copy License key { \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\": \"XXXXXXXX\" } Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location.

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation allows you to instrument parts of your app that are not instrumented automatically. This document describes how to instrument your app by decorating the methods in your app code with attributes. Use the Transaction attribute to create a custom transaction. You can also mark the custom transaction as a web transaction with the attribute's Web property. Use the Trace attribute to add custom instrumentation to methods that are invoked within a preexisting transaction. Requirements and recommendations Requirements include: .NET agent version 6.16.178.0 or higher. You must be willing to modify your source code. If you cannot or do not want to modify your source code, use custom instrumentation via XML. Your project must have a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll (for example, installing the package and placing using NewRelic.Api.Agent; in your code). This package is in the NuGet gallery. The Transaction and Trace attributes must be applied to concrete implementations of methods. They cannot be applied on interfaces or super class method definitions. Transactions called within transactions Methods decorated with the [Transaction] attribute will only create a new transaction when one does not already exist. When a method decorated with [Transaction] is called from within a previously started transaction, it will be treated as the [Trace] attribute instead, and will provide more information about the existing transaction. Example: Calling Transaction in an already-started transaction During the execution of this console application, OuterMethod will be called first and create a new transaction. The InnerMethod is called from within the transaction started by OuterMethod, so it will not create a new transaction. Instead, information about the execution of InnerMethod will be tracked as if the [Trace] attribute had been applied. static void Main(string[] args) { OuterMethod(); } [Transaction] public void OuterMethod() { InnerMethod(); } [Transaction] public void InnerMethod() { } Copy Create a new non-web transaction To start a non-web transaction (also known as a background request) with the Transaction attribute: [Transaction] public void Run() { // your background task } Copy For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Create a new web transaction To tell the agent to mark a non-web task as a web browser transaction, use either of these options: Set the Web property of the Transaction attribute to true. Set the transaction's URI with SetTransactionUri(). [Transaction(Web = true)] public void Run() { var uri = new Uri(\"http://www.mydomain.com/path\"); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.SetTransactionUri(uri); // your web task } Copy When used inside a previously started transaction, this will be treated as a [Trace] attribute. For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Add detail to existing transactions with Trace If your transaction traces show large blocks of un-instrumented time and you want to include additional methods within the trace, you can use the Trace attribute: [Trace] protected void MethodWithinTransaction() { // your app code } Copy Properties for [ Transaction] The Transaction attribute supports the following properties: Web Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent starts a web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. If a transaction is in progress, then that transaction will continue. If false (default), the agent starts a non-web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. For example: [Transaction(Web = true)] Copy Read forum posts about instrumentation For more specific recommendations, check out these posts in our Explorers Hub community: Troubleshoot attribute-based custom instrumentation issues Build custom instrumentation tracer factories from .NET agent log files Use other API functions For more about the .NET agent API and its functionality, see New Relic's .NET agent API guide.

      "body": "This document contains the configuration options for the APM .NET agent. Configuration overview APM agent configuration options allow you to control some aspects of how the agent behaves. Some of these config options are part of the basic install process (like setting your license key and app name), but most are more advanced settings, such as: setting a log level, setting up proxy host access, excluding certain attributes, and enabling distributed tracing. The .NET agent gets its configuration from the newrelic.config file, which is generated as part of the install process. By default, only a global newrelic.config file is created, but you can also create app-local newrelic.config files for finer control over a multi-app system. Other ways to set config options include: using environment variables, or setting server-side configuration from the UI. For more on the various config options and what overrides what, see Config settings precedence. Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core use the same configuration options and have the same APM features, unless otherwise stated. If you make changes to the config file and want to validate that it's in the right format, you can check it against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows) with any XSD validator. Important For IIS: after you change your newrelic.config or app.config file, perform an IISRESET from an administrative command prompt. Log level adjustments do not require a reset. Configuration methods and precedence levels Upon installation, the .NET agent's configuration file (newrelic.config) applies to all monitored applications, but you can configure the agent in other ways. Here's a diagram showing how different configuration options take precedence over one another: This diagram explains the order of precedence for different ways you might configure the .NET agent. Here are details about the configuration methods shown in the diagram, and their precedence levels: .NET configuration Details and precedence web.config or app.config or appsettings.json Configuration settings set in these files take highest precedence. However, if the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Environment variables Second-highest precedence. For more about these, see .NET environment variables. Server-side configuration Third-highest precedence. A limited number of server-side configuration settings are available; the other settings will come from other configuration sources. App-local newrelic.config Fourth-highest precedence. You can create app-local newrelic.config files to configure individual apps on a multi-app system. These local configuration files override settings in the global newrelic.config file. The agent looks for app-local config files in the following directories, in this order: A directory specified in your web.config or app.config file with the NewRelic.ConfigFile property The web app's root directory (with the app.config or web.config) The directory containing your app's executable file Note that the app-local config file must be complete and validate against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows). Default (global) newrelic.config Default source and the lowest precedence. Will configure all applications on a host in the absence of other config files. The global config file is located in the New Relic agent home directory: %PROGRAMDATA%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent Required environment variables New Relic's .NET agent relies on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to attach New Relic to your processes. Some .NET agent install procedures (like the MSI installer) will automatically set these variables for you; some procedures will require you to manually set them. Caution Security recommendation: You should consider what users can set system environment variables. You should also secure the accounts under which your applications execute to prevent user environment variables overriding system environment variables .NET Framework environment variables For .NET Framework, the following variables are required: COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. .NET Core environment variables For .NET Core, the following variables are required: Linux: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path/to/agent/directory CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=\"${CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME}/libNewRelicProfiler.so\" Copy Windows: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. If your system has previously used monitoring services (non-New Relic), you may have a \"profiler conflict\" when trying to install and use the New Relic agent. More details: Profiler conflict explanation New Relic’s .NET agents rely on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to load New Relic into your processes. The install-related environment variables are Microsoft variables, not New Relic variables. They can be used by other .NET profilers, and only one profiler can be attached to a process at a time. For this reason, if you have used previous application monitoring products, you may have profiler conflicts. For specific install instructions, see the .NET agent install documentation. Optional environment variables Some configuration options in New Relic's .NET agent can be set via environment variables as an alternative to setting them in a config file. Below is a list of environment variables recognized by the .NET agent with example values. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false NEW_RELIC_LABELS=foo:bar;zip:zap NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY=path\\to\\agent\\directory (not configurable via config file) Copy Setup options, newrelic.config Use these options to setup and configure your agent via the newrelic.config file. The New Relic .NET agent supports the following categories of setup options: Configuration element Service element Obscuring key element Proxy element Log element Application element (configuration) Data transmission element Host name Configuration element The root element of the configuration document is a configuration element. <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\" agentEnabled=\"true\" maxStackTraceLines=\"50\" timingPrecision=\"low\"> Copy The configuration element supports the following attributes: agentEnabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the New Relic agent. maxStackTraceLines Type Integer Default 80 The maximum number of stack frames to trace in any stack dump. timingPrecision Type String Default low Controls the precision of the timers. High precision will provide better data, but at a lower execution speed. Possible values are high and low. Service element The first child of the configuration element is a service element. The service element configures the agent's connection to the New Relic service. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" sendEnvironmentInfo=\"true\" syncStartup=\"false\" sendDataOnExit=\"false\" sendDataOnExitThreshold=\"60000\" autoStart=\"true\"/> Copy The service element supports the following attributes: licenseKey (required) Type String Default (none) Your New Relic license key. New Relic uses the license key to match your app's data to the correct account in the UI. Set the license key via environment variable. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX Copy sendEnvironmentInfo Type Boolean Default true Instructs the agent to record execution environment information. Environment information includes operating system, agent version, and which assemblies are available. syncStartup Type Boolean Default false Block application startup until the agent connects to New Relic. If set to true, the first transaction may take substantially longer to complete, because it is blocked until the connection to New Relic is finished. sendDataOnExit Type Boolean Default false Block application shutdown until the agent sends all data from the latest harvest cycle. sendDataOnExitThreshold Type Integer Default 60000 Unit Milliseconds The minimum amount of time the process must run before the agent blocks it from shutting down. This setting only applies when sendDataOnExit is true. completeTransactionsOnThread Type Boolean Default false If false, the agent uses a pool thread to complete the transaction processing. If true, the agent will complete transaction processing on the request thread. requestTimeout Type Integer Default 2000 (sendDataOnExit enabled) 120000 (sendDataOnExit disabled) Unit Milliseconds The agent's request timeout when communicating with New Relic. autoStart Type Boolean Default True Automatically start the .NET agent when the first instrumented method is hit. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true The option to disable SSL is valid only for .NET agent versions 7.x and earlier. .NET agent version 8.x and higher communicate only via SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. Obscuring key element The obscuringKey element is an optional child of the service element. The .NET Agent uses this value to deobfuscate supported configuration values. For example, when an obfuscated proxy password is supplied, it will be deobfuscated using this key. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <obscuringKey>OBSCURING_KEY</obscuringKey> </service> Copy The obscuring key may also be configured by setting the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY environment variable. Caution Security recommendation: The placement of the obscuring Key in the same configuration file as an obfuscated value may pose a security risk. Consider placing the obscuring key in an environment variable and limiting access to environment variables within your environment. Proxy element The proxy element is an optional child of the service element. The proxy element is used when the agent communicates to the New Relic back-end service via a proxy. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <proxy host=\"hostname\" port=\"PROXY_PORT\" uriPath=\"path/to/something.aspx\" domain=\"mydomain.com\" user=\"PROXY_USERNAME\" password=\"PROXY_PASSWORD\" passwordObfuscated=\"OBFUSCATED_PROXY_PASSWORD\"/> </service> Copy The proxy element supports the following attributes: host Type String Default (none) Defines the proxy host. port Type Integer Default 8080 Defines the proxy port. uriPath Type String Default (none) Optionally define a proxy URI path. domain Type String Default (none) Optionally define a domain to use when authenticating with the proxy server. user Type String Default (none) Optionally define a user name for authentication. password Type String Default (none) Optionally define a password for authentication. passwordObfuscated Type String Default (none) For additional security, the .NET Agent supports the use of an obfuscated proxy password with the passwordObfuscated attribute. The obfuscated proxy password is generated using the following New Relic CLI command: newrelic agent config obfuscate --key OBSCURING_KEY --value \"CLEAR_TEXT_PROXY_PASSWORD\" Copy Important When using an obfuscated proxy password, the obscuring key must also be configured. Log element The log element is a child of the configuration element. The log element configures New Relic's logging . The agent generates its own log file to keep its logging information separate from your application's logs. <log level=\"info\" auditLog=\"false\" console=\"false\" directory=\"PATH\\TO\\LOG\\DIRECTORY\" fileName=\"FILENAME.log\" /> Copy The log element supports the following attributes: level Type String Default info Defines the level of detail recorded in the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: off error warn info debug finest all Important Increasing the log level will increase New Relic's performance impact. auditLog Type Boolean Default false Records all data sent to and received from New Relic in both an auditlog log file and the standard log file. console Type Boolean Default false Send log messages to the console, in addition to the log file. directory Type String Default C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs The directory to hold log files generated by the agent. If this is omitted, then a directory named logs in the New Relic agent install area will be used by default. fileName Type String Default (none) Defines a name for the log file. If you do not define a fileName, the name is derived from the name of the monitored process. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log Copy Application element (required) The application element is a child of the configuration element. This required element defines your application name, and disables or enables sampling. name Type String Default My Application The name of your .NET application is a child of the application element. New Relic will aggregate your data according to this name. For example, if you have two running applications named AppA and AppB, you will see two applications in the New Relic interface: AppA and AppB. You can also assign up to three names to your app. The first name is the primary name. For example: <application> <name>MY APPLICATION PRIMARY</name> <name>SECOND APP NAME</name> <name>THIRD APP NAME</name> </application> Copy Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name Copy disableSamplers Type Boolean Default false Samplers collect information about memory and CPU consumption. Set this to true to disable sampling. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true Copy Data transmission element The dataTransmission element is a child of the configuration element. This element affects how data is sent to New Relic and can be used if you have specific data transmission requirements. <dataTransmission putForDataSend=\"false\" compressedContentEncoding=\"deflate\"/> Copy The dataTransmission element supports the following attributes: putForDataSend Type Boolean Default false Defines the HTTP method used when sending data to New Relic. Set this to true to enable using the PUT method when sending data. The POST method is used by default. Host name If the default host name label in the APM UI is not useful, you can decorate that name in the New Relic UI with a display name. After the application process is restarted and the .NET agent is reporting again, the display name will appear in the Servers drop-down list. This host name setting does not affect the list of hosts on your application's Summary page. To set a display name, choose one of the following options. The environment variable takes precedence over the config file value. Then restart your application to see your changes in the New Relic UI. Set using config file Set the displayName attribute in the processHost element in newrelic.config. The processHost element is a child of the configuration element. <configuration . . . > <processHost displayName=\"CUSTOM_NAME\" /> </configuration> Copy Set using environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME environment variable: NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME = \"CUSTOM_NAME\" Copy Cloud platform utilization Configures the utilization configuration element to control how the agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service to determine pricing. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances, Docker containers, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and Kubernetes. detectAws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detectAzure Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Azure metadata API. detectGcp Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls GCP metadata API. detectPcf Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls PCF information from environment variables. detectDocker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. detectKubernetes Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Kubernetes information from environment variables. Instrumentation options Use these options to configure which elements of your application and environment to instrument. New Relic for .NET supports the following categories of instrumentation options: Instrumentation element Applications element (instrumentation) Attributes element Instrumentation element The instrumentation element is a child of the configuration element. By default, the .NET agent instruments IIS asp worker processes and Azure web and worker roles. To instrument other processes, see Instrumenting custom applications. Applications element (instrumentation) The applications element is a child of the instrumentation element. The applications element specifies which non-web apps to instrument. It contains a name attribute. Important This is not the same as the application (configuration) element, which is a child of the configuration element. <instrumentation> <applications> <application name=\"MyService1.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService2.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService3.exe\" /> </applications> </instrumentation> Copy Attributes element An attribute is a key/value pair that determines the properties of an event or transaction. Each attribute is sent to APM transaction traces, APM error traces, Transaction events, TransactionError events, or PageView events. The primary attributes element enables or disables attribute collection for the .NET agent, and defines specific attributes to collect or exclude. You can also configure attribute settings based on their destination: Error collection, transaction traces, Browser instrumentation, and transaction events. In this example, the agent excludes all attributes whose key begins with myApiKey (myApiKey.bar, myApiKey.value), but collects the custom attribute myApiKey.foo. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> Copy You can view the .NET APM attributes on the .NET agent attributes page. You can also define custom attributes with the agent API call AddCustomParameter. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable attribute collection. When set to false in the primary attribute element, this setting overrides all attribute settings for individual destinations. include Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will collect all attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. exclude Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will not collect attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. Feature options Use these options to enable, disable, and configure New Relic features. New Relic for .NET allows you to configure the following features: App pools Cross application traces Error collection High security mode Strip exception messages Transaction events Custom events Custom parameters Tags/labels Browser instrumentation Slow Queries Transaction traces Datastore tracer Distributed tracing Span events App pools Important This is only applicable to a system's global config file. The applicationPools element is a child of the configuration element. The applicationPools element specifies for the profiler exactly which application pools to instrument and uses the same name as the IIS application pool name. This configuration element is useful when you may need to instrument only a small subset of your app pools. For example, a given server might have several hundred application pools, but only a few of those pools need to be instrumented by the .NET agent. Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"false\"/> </applicationPools> Copy Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for all application pools currently executing on the server and enabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <defaultBehavior instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"true\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"true\"/> </applicationPools> Copy The applicationPools element supports the following elements: defaultBehavior Type Boolean Default false Defines how the .NET agent will behave on a \"global\" level for application pools served via IIS. The .NET agent instruments all application pools by default. When true, application pools listed under applicationPool with an instrument attribute set to false will not be instrumented. Essentially, when set to false, the application pool list acts as an allow list. When set to true, the application pool list acts as a deny list. applicationPool Defines instrumentation behavior for a specific application pool. The name attribute is the name of an application pool. Enable or disable profiling in the instrument attribute. Define this application in the name attribute. Cross application traces The crossApplicationTracer element is a child of the configuration element. crossApplicationTracer links transaction traces across applications. When linked in a service-oriented architecture, all instrumented applications that communicate with each other via HTTP will now \"link\" transaction traces with the applications that they call and the applications they are called by. Cross application tracing makes it easier to understand the performance relationship between services and applications. <crossApplicationTracer enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The crossApplicationTracer element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable cross application tracing Error collection The errorCollector element is a child of the configuration element. errorCollector configures error collection, which captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic. <errorCollector enabled=\"true\" captureEvents=\"true\" maxEventSamplesStored=\"100\"> <ignoreClasses> <errorClass>System.IO.FileNotFoundException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.Threading.ThreadAbortException</errorClass> </ignoreClasses> <ignoreMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Ignore message</message> <message>Ignore too</message> </errorClass> </ignoreMessages> <ignoreStatusCodes> <code>401</code> <code>404</code> </ignoreStatusCodes> <expectedClasses> <errorClass>System.ArgumentNullException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException</errorClass> </expectedClasses> <expectedMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Expected message</message> <message>Expected too</message> </errorClass> </expectedMessages> <expectedStatusCodes>403,500-505</expectedStatusCodes> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </errorCollector> Copy Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. The errorCollector element supports the following elements and attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the error collector. captureEvents Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capturing of error events. maxEventSamplesStored Type Integer Default 100 Reservoir limit for error events. ignoreClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be ignored. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreErrors (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Lists specific exceptions to not report to New Relic. The full name of the exception should be used, such as System.IO.FileNotFoundException. ignoreStatusCodes Type String Default (none) Lists specific HTTP error codes to not report to New Relic. You can use standard integral HTTP error codes, such as just 401, or you may use Microsoft full status codes with decimal points, such as 401.4 or 403.18. The status codes should be equal to or greater than 400. expectedClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be marked as expected. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedStatusCodes A comma separated list of status codes. The list may include integer ranges, using a single dash (-) and will be inclusive of both the starting and ending integer in the range. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for error traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. High security mode The highSecurity element is a child of the configuration element. To enable high security mode, set this property to true and enable high security property in the New Relic user interface. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request parameters and custom parameters are not collected, strip exception messages is enabled, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable high security mode. Example: <highSecurity enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Strip exception messages The stripExceptionMessages element is a child of the configuration element. To enable strip exception messages, set this property to true. By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically changed to true, and the agent strips the messages from exceptions. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable strip exception messages. Example: <stripExceptionMessages enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Transaction events The transactionEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use transactionEvents to configure transaction events. <transactionEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionEvents> Copy The transactionEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to transaction events. Attribute settings can be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Caution When distributed tracing and/or Infinite Tracing are enabled, information from transaction events is applied to the root Span Event of the transaction. Consider applying any attribute settings for transaction events to span events and/or apply them as Global Attribute settings. Custom events The customEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use customEvents to configure custom events. <customEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"/> Copy The CustomEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy Custom parameters The customParameters element is a child of the configuration element. Use customParameters to configure custom parameters. <customParameters enabled=\"true\" /> Copy The CustomParameters element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capture of custom parameters. Labels (tags) The labels element is a child of the configuration element. This sets tag names and values. The list is a semicolon delimited list of colon-separated name and value pairs. You can also use with the NEW_RELIC_LABELS environment variable. Example: <labels>foo:bar;zip:zap</labels> Copy Browser instrumentation The browserMonitoring element is a child of the configuration element. browserMonitoring configures Browser monitoring in your .NET application. Browser gives you insight your end users' performance experience. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your webpages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. // If you use both the Exclude and Attribute elements // the Exclude element must be listed first. <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </browserMonitoring> Copy The browserMonitoring element supports the following attributes: autoInstrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically injects the Browser agent JavaScript. To turn off automatic injection, set this attribute to false. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for Browser. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. requestPathsExcluded Use this sub-element to prevent the Browser agent from being injected in specific pages. The element is used as follows: <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> Copy The agent will not inject the Browser agent into pages whose URL matches one of the specified regular expressions. The regular expression should follow Microsoft guidelines for the Regex class. It is a reference to the virtual directory of the path in your application and not the full URL of the path you wish to exclude. For example, to exclude the pages in https://www.mywebsite.com/mywebpages/ you would simply insert /mywebpages/ as the path regex value. The requestPathsExcluded element should be used in cases where it is impossible or undesirable to use the DisableBrowserMonitoring() call. To minimize a possible performance impact try to use as few regular expressions as possible and keep them as simple as possible. Slow queries The slowSql element is a child of the configuration element. slowSql configures capturing information about slow query executions, and captures and obfuscates explain plans for these queries. <slowSql enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The slowSql element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable slow query tracing. Transaction traces The transactionTracer element is a child of the configuration element. transactionTracer configures transaction traces. Included in the trace is the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. <transactionTracer enabled=\"true\" transactionThreshold=\"apdex_f\" recordSql=\"obfuscated\" explainEnabled=\"true\" explainThreshold=\"500\" maxSegments=\"3000\" maxExplainPlans=\"20\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionTracer> Copy The transactionTracer element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable transaction traces. transactionThreshold Type String Default apdex_f Defines the threshold for transaction traces. If a transaction takes longer than the threshold, it is eligible for being traced. See transaction trace basics for more about the rules governing traces. The default value is apdex_f, which sets the threshold to four times the application's apdex_t value. For more information about apdex_t, see Apdex. You can also set the threshold to be a specific time value in milliseconds. recordSql Type String Default obfuscated Select a query tracing policy. Options are off, which records nothing; obfuscated, which records an obfuscated version of the query; or raw, which records the query exactly as it is issued to the database. Caution Recording raw queries may capture sensitive information. explainEnabled Type Boolean Default false When true, the agent captures EXPLAIN statements for slow queries. explainThreshold Type Integer Default 500 Unit Milliseconds The agent collects slow query data for queries that exceed this threshold, along with any available explain plans, as part of transaction traces. maxSegments Type Integer Default 3000 The maximum number of segments to collect in a transaction trace. maxExplainPlans Type Integer Default 20 The maximum number of explain plans to collect during a harvest cycle. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Datastore tracer The datastoreTracer element is a child of the configuration element. <datastoreTracer> <instanceReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <databaseNameReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <queryParameters enabled=\"false\" /> </datastoreTracer> Copy The datastoreTracer element supports the following sub-elements: instanceReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. databaseNameReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. The default value of attribute enabled is true. queryParameters Use this sub-element to enable collection of the SQL query parameters on slow query traces. The default value of attribute enabled is false. Caution Recording query parameters may capture sensitive information. The transactionTracer.recordSql configuration option must be set to raw or this option is ignored. Distributed tracing The distributedTracing element is a child of the configuration element. <distributedTracing enabled=\"false\" excludeNewrelicHeader=\"false\"/> Copy Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the planning guide. Important Requires .NET agent version 8.6.45.0 or higher. The distributedTracing element supports the following attributes: To enable or disable, see Enable distributed tracing. enabled Type Boolean Default false Alternatively, enable distributed tracing via the NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true Copy excludeNewrelicHeader Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing reports span events. Span event reporting is enabled by default, but distributed tracing must be enabled for spans to be reported. To disable span events, choose one of the following options: Disable span events via config file Set the <spanEvents> element to false to disable via the newrelic.config file. This element is a child of the <configuration> element. <configuration . . . > <spanEvents enabled=\"false\" /> </configuration> Copy Disable span events via environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false Copy Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing extends the distributed tracing service by employing a trace observer that is external to the agent. It observes 100% of your application traces across various services and provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. Important Infinite Tracing requires .NET Agent version 8.30 or higher. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional settings below <configuration . . . > <distributedTracing enabled=\"true\" /> <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer host=\"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" /> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy The infiniteTracing element supports the following elements: trace_observer The trace_observer element identifies an observer host that is independent from the agent. For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint. The trace observer may be configured using the NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST environment variable as well. Important When configuring the trace observer, you should not supply the protocol as part of the host. For example, use myhost.infinitetracing.com instead of https://myhost.infinitetracing.com. Span events The spanEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use spanEvents to configure span events. <spanEvents enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </spanEvents> Copy The spanEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for span events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to span events. Attribute settings may be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Settings in app.config or web.config For ASP.NET and .NET Framework console apps you can also configure the following settings in your app's app.config or web.config, within the outermost element, <configuration>: Enable and disable the agent <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"false\" /> </appSettings> Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AppName\" value =\"Descriptive Name\" /> </appSettings> Copy License key <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\" value =\"XXXXXXXX\" /> </appSettings> Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\" value=\"C:\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\newrelic.config\" /> </appSettings> Copy Settings in appsettings.json For .NET Core apps, you can configure the following settings in appsettings.json if the following is true: The appsettings.json file must be located in the current working directory of the application. The application must have the following dependencies: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.EnvironmentVariables Enable and disable the agent { \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\":\"false\" } Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled setting in this file will be ignored.

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation allows you to instrument parts of your app that are not instrumented automatically. This document describes how to instrument your app by decorating the methods in your app code with attributes. Use the Transaction attribute to create a custom transaction. You can also mark the custom transaction as a web transaction with the attribute's Web property. Use the Trace attribute to add custom instrumentation to methods that are invoked within a preexisting transaction. Requirements and recommendations Requirements include: .NET agent version 6.16.178.0 or higher. You must be willing to modify your source code. If you cannot or do not want to modify your source code, use custom instrumentation via XML. Your project must have a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll (for example, installing the package and placing using NewRelic.Api.Agent; in your code). This package is in the NuGet gallery. The Transaction and Trace attributes must be applied to concrete implementations of methods. They cannot be applied on interfaces or super class method definitions. Transactions called within transactions Methods decorated with the [Transaction] attribute will only create a new transaction when one does not already exist. When a method decorated with [Transaction] is called from within a previously started transaction, it will be treated as the [Trace] attribute instead, and will provide more information about the existing transaction. Example: Calling Transaction in an already-started transaction During the execution of this console application, OuterMethod will be called first and create a new transaction. The InnerMethod is called from within the transaction started by OuterMethod, so it will not create a new transaction. Instead, information about the execution of InnerMethod will be tracked as if the [Trace] attribute had been applied. static void Main(string[] args) { OuterMethod(); } [Transaction] public void OuterMethod() { InnerMethod(); } [Transaction] public void InnerMethod() { } Copy Create a new non-web transaction To start a non-web transaction (also known as a background request) with the Transaction attribute: [Transaction] public void Run() { // your background task } Copy For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Create a new web transaction To tell the agent to mark a non-web task as a web browser transaction, use either of these options: Set the Web property of the Transaction attribute to true. Set the transaction's URI with SetTransactionUri(). [Transaction(Web = true)] public void Run() { var uri = new Uri(\"http://www.mydomain.com/path\"); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.SetTransactionUri(uri); // your web task } Copy When used inside a previously started transaction, this will be treated as a [Trace] attribute. For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Add detail to existing transactions with Trace If your transaction traces show large blocks of un-instrumented time and you want to include additional methods within the trace, you can use the Trace attribute: [Trace] protected void MethodWithinTransaction() { // your app code } Copy Properties for [ Transaction] The Transaction attribute supports the following properties: Web Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent starts a web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. If a transaction is in progress, then that transaction will continue. If false (default), the agent starts a non-web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. For example: [Transaction(Web = true)] Copy Read forum posts about instrumentation For more specific recommendations, check out these posts in our Explorers Hub community: Troubleshoot attribute-based custom instrumentation issues Build custom instrumentation tracer factories from .NET agent log files Use other API functions For more about the .NET agent API and its functionality, see New Relic's .NET agent API guide.

      "body": "This document contains the configuration options for the APM .NET agent. Configuration overview APM agent configuration options allow you to control some aspects of how the agent behaves. Some of these config options are part of the basic install process (like setting your license key and app name), but most are more advanced settings, such as: setting a log level, setting up proxy host access, excluding certain attributes, and enabling distributed tracing. The .NET agent gets its configuration from the newrelic.config file, which is generated as part of the install process. By default, only a global newrelic.config file is created, but you can also create app-local newrelic.config files for finer control over a multi-app system. Other ways to set config options include: using environment variables, or setting server-side configuration from the UI. For more on the various config options and what overrides what, see Config settings precedence. Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core use the same configuration options and have the same APM features, unless otherwise stated. If you make changes to the config file and want to validate that it's in the right format, you can check it against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows) with any XSD validator. Important For IIS: after you change your newrelic.config or app.config file, perform an IISRESET from an administrative command prompt. Log level adjustments do not require a reset. Configuration methods and precedence levels Upon installation, the .NET agent's configuration file (newrelic.config) applies to all monitored applications, but you can configure the agent in other ways. Here's a diagram showing how different configuration options take precedence over one another: This diagram explains the order of precedence for different ways you might configure the .NET agent. Here are details about the configuration methods shown in the diagram, and their precedence levels: .NET configuration Details and precedence web.config or app.config or appsettings.json Configuration settings set in these files take highest precedence. However, if the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Environment variables Second-highest precedence. For more about these, see .NET environment variables. Server-side configuration Third-highest precedence. A limited number of server-side configuration settings are available; the other settings will come from other configuration sources. App-local newrelic.config Fourth-highest precedence. You can create app-local newrelic.config files to configure individual apps on a multi-app system. These local configuration files override settings in the global newrelic.config file. The agent looks for app-local config files in the following directories, in this order: A directory specified in your web.config or app.config file with the NewRelic.ConfigFile property The web app's root directory (with the app.config or web.config) The directory containing your app's executable file Note that the app-local config file must be complete and validate against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows). Default (global) newrelic.config Default source and the lowest precedence. Will configure all applications on a host in the absence of other config files. The global config file is located in the New Relic agent home directory: %PROGRAMDATA%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent Required environment variables New Relic's .NET agent relies on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to attach New Relic to your processes. Some .NET agent install procedures (like the MSI installer) will automatically set these variables for you; some procedures will require you to manually set them. Caution Security recommendation: You should consider what users can set system environment variables. You should also secure the accounts under which your applications execute to prevent user environment variables overriding system environment variables .NET Framework environment variables For .NET Framework, the following variables are required: COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. .NET Core environment variables For .NET Core, the following variables are required: Linux: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path/to/agent/directory CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=\"${CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME}/libNewRelicProfiler.so\" Copy Windows: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. If your system has previously used monitoring services (non-New Relic), you may have a \"profiler conflict\" when trying to install and use the New Relic agent. More details: Profiler conflict explanation New Relic’s .NET agents rely on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to load New Relic into your processes. The install-related environment variables are Microsoft variables, not New Relic variables. They can be used by other .NET profilers, and only one profiler can be attached to a process at a time. For this reason, if you have used previous application monitoring products, you may have profiler conflicts. For specific install instructions, see the .NET agent install documentation. Optional environment variables Some configuration options in New Relic's .NET agent can be set via environment variables as an alternative to setting them in a config file. Below is a list of environment variables recognized by the .NET agent with example values. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false NEW_RELIC_LABELS=foo:bar;zip:zap NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY=path\\to\\agent\\directory (not configurable via config file) Copy Setup options, newrelic.config Use these options to setup and configure your agent via the newrelic.config file. The New Relic .NET agent supports the following categories of setup options: Configuration element Service element Obscuring key element Proxy element Log element Application element (configuration) Data transmission element Host name Configuration element The root element of the configuration document is a configuration element. <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\" agentEnabled=\"true\" maxStackTraceLines=\"50\" timingPrecision=\"low\"> Copy The configuration element supports the following attributes: agentEnabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the New Relic agent. maxStackTraceLines Type Integer Default 80 The maximum number of stack frames to trace in any stack dump. timingPrecision Type String Default low Controls the precision of the timers. High precision will provide better data, but at a lower execution speed. Possible values are high and low. Service element The first child of the configuration element is a service element. The service element configures the agent's connection to the New Relic service. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" sendEnvironmentInfo=\"true\" syncStartup=\"false\" sendDataOnExit=\"false\" sendDataOnExitThreshold=\"60000\" autoStart=\"true\"/> Copy The service element supports the following attributes: licenseKey (required) Type String Default (none) Your New Relic license key. New Relic uses the license key to match your app's data to the correct account in the UI. Set the license key via environment variable. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX Copy sendEnvironmentInfo Type Boolean Default true Instructs the agent to record execution environment information. Environment information includes operating system, agent version, and which assemblies are available. syncStartup Type Boolean Default false Block application startup until the agent connects to New Relic. If set to true, the first transaction may take substantially longer to complete, because it is blocked until the connection to New Relic is finished. sendDataOnExit Type Boolean Default false Block application shutdown until the agent sends all data from the latest harvest cycle. sendDataOnExitThreshold Type Integer Default 60000 Unit Milliseconds The minimum amount of time the process must run before the agent blocks it from shutting down. This setting only applies when sendDataOnExit is true. completeTransactionsOnThread Type Boolean Default false If false, the agent uses a pool thread to complete the transaction processing. If true, the agent will complete transaction processing on the request thread. requestTimeout Type Integer Default 2000 (sendDataOnExit enabled) 120000 (sendDataOnExit disabled) Unit Milliseconds The agent's request timeout when communicating with New Relic. autoStart Type Boolean Default True Automatically start the .NET agent when the first instrumented method is hit. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true The option to disable SSL is valid only for .NET agent versions 7.x and earlier. .NET agent version 8.x and higher communicate only via SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. Obscuring key element The obscuringKey element is an optional child of the service element. The .NET Agent uses this value to deobfuscate supported configuration values. For example, when an obfuscated proxy password is supplied, it will be deobfuscated using this key. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <obscuringKey>OBSCURING_KEY</obscuringKey> </service> Copy The obscuring key may also be configured by setting the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY environment variable. Caution Security recommendation: The placement of the obscuring Key in the same configuration file as an obfuscated value may pose a security risk. Consider placing the obscuring key in an environment variable and limiting access to environment variables within your environment. Proxy element The proxy element is an optional child of the service element. The proxy element is used when the agent communicates to the New Relic back-end service via a proxy. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <proxy host=\"hostname\" port=\"PROXY_PORT\" uriPath=\"path/to/something.aspx\" domain=\"mydomain.com\" user=\"PROXY_USERNAME\" password=\"PROXY_PASSWORD\" passwordObfuscated=\"OBFUSCATED_PROXY_PASSWORD\"/> </service> Copy The proxy element supports the following attributes: host Type String Default (none) Defines the proxy host. port Type Integer Default 8080 Defines the proxy port. uriPath Type String Default (none) Optionally define a proxy URI path. domain Type String Default (none) Optionally define a domain to use when authenticating with the proxy server. user Type String Default (none) Optionally define a user name for authentication. password Type String Default (none) Optionally define a password for authentication. passwordObfuscated Type String Default (none) For additional security, the .NET Agent supports the use of an obfuscated proxy password with the passwordObfuscated attribute. The obfuscated proxy password is generated using the following New Relic CLI command: newrelic agent config obfuscate --key OBSCURING_KEY --value \"CLEAR_TEXT_PROXY_PASSWORD\" Copy Important When using an obfuscated proxy password, the obscuring key must also be configured. Log element The log element is a child of the configuration element. The log element configures New Relic's logging . The agent generates its own log file to keep its logging information separate from your application's logs. <log level=\"info\" auditLog=\"false\" console=\"false\" directory=\"PATH\\TO\\LOG\\DIRECTORY\" fileName=\"FILENAME.log\" /> Copy The log element supports the following attributes: level Type String Default info Defines the level of detail recorded in the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: off error warn info debug finest all Important Increasing the log level will increase New Relic's performance impact. auditLog Type Boolean Default false Records all data sent to and received from New Relic in both an auditlog log file and the standard log file. console Type Boolean Default false Send log messages to the console, in addition to the log file. directory Type String Default C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs The directory to hold log files generated by the agent. If this is omitted, then a directory named logs in the New Relic agent install area will be used by default. fileName Type String Default (none) Defines a name for the log file. If you do not define a fileName, the name is derived from the name of the monitored process. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log Copy Application element (required) The application element is a child of the configuration element. This required element defines your application name, and disables or enables sampling. name Type String Default My Application The name of your .NET application is a child of the application element. New Relic will aggregate your data according to this name. For example, if you have two running applications named AppA and AppB, you will see two applications in the New Relic interface: AppA and AppB. You can also assign up to three names to your app. The first name is the primary name. For example: <application> <name>MY APPLICATION PRIMARY</name> <name>SECOND APP NAME</name> <name>THIRD APP NAME</name> </application> Copy Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name Copy disableSamplers Type Boolean Default false Samplers collect information about memory and CPU consumption. Set this to true to disable sampling. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true Copy Data transmission element The dataTransmission element is a child of the configuration element. This element affects how data is sent to New Relic and can be used if you have specific data transmission requirements. <dataTransmission putForDataSend=\"false\" compressedContentEncoding=\"deflate\"/> Copy The dataTransmission element supports the following attributes: putForDataSend Type Boolean Default false Defines the HTTP method used when sending data to New Relic. Set this to true to enable using the PUT method when sending data. The POST method is used by default. Host name If the default host name label in the APM UI is not useful, you can decorate that name in the New Relic UI with a display name. After the application process is restarted and the .NET agent is reporting again, the display name will appear in the Servers drop-down list. This host name setting does not affect the list of hosts on your application's Summary page. To set a display name, choose one of the following options. The environment variable takes precedence over the config file value. Then restart your application to see your changes in the New Relic UI. Set using config file Set the displayName attribute in the processHost element in newrelic.config. The processHost element is a child of the configuration element. <configuration . . . > <processHost displayName=\"CUSTOM_NAME\" /> </configuration> Copy Set using environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME environment variable: NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME = \"CUSTOM_NAME\" Copy Cloud platform utilization Configures the utilization configuration element to control how the agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service to determine pricing. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances, Docker containers, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and Kubernetes. detectAws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detectAzure Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Azure metadata API. detectGcp Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls GCP metadata API. detectPcf Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls PCF information from environment variables. detectDocker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. detectKubernetes Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Kubernetes information from environment variables. Instrumentation options Use these options to configure which elements of your application and environment to instrument. New Relic for .NET supports the following categories of instrumentation options: Instrumentation element Applications element (instrumentation) Attributes element Instrumentation element The instrumentation element is a child of the configuration element. By default, the .NET agent instruments IIS asp worker processes and Azure web and worker roles. To instrument other processes, see Instrumenting custom applications. Applications element (instrumentation) The applications element is a child of the instrumentation element. The applications element specifies which non-web apps to instrument. It contains a name attribute. Important This is not the same as the application (configuration) element, which is a child of the configuration element. <instrumentation> <applications> <application name=\"MyService1.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService2.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService3.exe\" /> </applications> </instrumentation> Copy Attributes element An attribute is a key/value pair that determines the properties of an event or transaction. Each attribute is sent to APM transaction traces, APM error traces, Transaction events, TransactionError events, or PageView events. The primary attributes element enables or disables attribute collection for the .NET agent, and defines specific attributes to collect or exclude. You can also configure attribute settings based on their destination: Error collection, transaction traces, Browser instrumentation, and transaction events. In this example, the agent excludes all attributes whose key begins with myApiKey (myApiKey.bar, myApiKey.value), but collects the custom attribute myApiKey.foo. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> Copy You can view the .NET APM attributes on the .NET agent attributes page. You can also define custom attributes with the agent API call AddCustomParameter. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable attribute collection. When set to false in the primary attribute element, this setting overrides all attribute settings for individual destinations. include Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will collect all attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. exclude Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will not collect attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. Feature options Use these options to enable, disable, and configure New Relic features. New Relic for .NET allows you to configure the following features: App pools Cross application traces Error collection High security mode Strip exception messages Transaction events Custom events Custom parameters Tags/labels Browser instrumentation Slow Queries Transaction traces Datastore tracer Distributed tracing Span events App pools Important This is only applicable to a system's global config file. The applicationPools element is a child of the configuration element. The applicationPools element specifies for the profiler exactly which application pools to instrument and uses the same name as the IIS application pool name. This configuration element is useful when you may need to instrument only a small subset of your app pools. For example, a given server might have several hundred application pools, but only a few of those pools need to be instrumented by the .NET agent. Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"false\"/> </applicationPools> Copy Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for all application pools currently executing on the server and enabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <defaultBehavior instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"true\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"true\"/> </applicationPools> Copy The applicationPools element supports the following elements: defaultBehavior Type Boolean Default false Defines how the .NET agent will behave on a \"global\" level for application pools served via IIS. The .NET agent instruments all application pools by default. When true, application pools listed under applicationPool with an instrument attribute set to false will not be instrumented. Essentially, when set to false, the application pool list acts as an allow list. When set to true, the application pool list acts as a deny list. applicationPool Defines instrumentation behavior for a specific application pool. The name attribute is the name of an application pool. Enable or disable profiling in the instrument attribute. Define this application in the name attribute. Cross application traces The crossApplicationTracer element is a child of the configuration element. crossApplicationTracer links transaction traces across applications. When linked in a service-oriented architecture, all instrumented applications that communicate with each other via HTTP will now \"link\" transaction traces with the applications that they call and the applications they are called by. Cross application tracing makes it easier to understand the performance relationship between services and applications. <crossApplicationTracer enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The crossApplicationTracer element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable cross application tracing Error collection The errorCollector element is a child of the configuration element. errorCollector configures error collection, which captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic. <errorCollector enabled=\"true\" captureEvents=\"true\" maxEventSamplesStored=\"100\"> <ignoreClasses> <errorClass>System.IO.FileNotFoundException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.Threading.ThreadAbortException</errorClass> </ignoreClasses> <ignoreMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Ignore message</message> <message>Ignore too</message> </errorClass> </ignoreMessages> <ignoreStatusCodes> <code>401</code> <code>404</code> </ignoreStatusCodes> <expectedClasses> <errorClass>System.ArgumentNullException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException</errorClass> </expectedClasses> <expectedMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Expected message</message> <message>Expected too</message> </errorClass> </expectedMessages> <expectedStatusCodes>403,500-505</expectedStatusCodes> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </errorCollector> Copy Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. The errorCollector element supports the following elements and attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the error collector. captureEvents Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capturing of error events. maxEventSamplesStored Type Integer Default 100 Reservoir limit for error events. ignoreClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be ignored. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreErrors (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Lists specific exceptions to not report to New Relic. The full name of the exception should be used, such as System.IO.FileNotFoundException. ignoreStatusCodes Type String Default (none) Lists specific HTTP error codes to not report to New Relic. You can use standard integral HTTP error codes, such as just 401, or you may use Microsoft full status codes with decimal points, such as 401.4 or 403.18. The status codes should be equal to or greater than 400. expectedClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be marked as expected. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedStatusCodes A comma separated list of status codes. The list may include integer ranges, using a single dash (-) and will be inclusive of both the starting and ending integer in the range. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for error traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. High security mode The highSecurity element is a child of the configuration element. To enable high security mode, set this property to true and enable high security property in the New Relic user interface. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request parameters and custom parameters are not collected, strip exception messages is enabled, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable high security mode. Example: <highSecurity enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Strip exception messages The stripExceptionMessages element is a child of the configuration element. To enable strip exception messages, set this property to true. By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically changed to true, and the agent strips the messages from exceptions. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable strip exception messages. Example: <stripExceptionMessages enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Transaction events The transactionEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use transactionEvents to configure transaction events. <transactionEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionEvents> Copy The transactionEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to transaction events. Attribute settings can be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Caution When distributed tracing and/or Infinite Tracing are enabled, information from transaction events is applied to the root Span Event of the transaction. Consider applying any attribute settings for transaction events to span events and/or apply them as Global Attribute settings. Custom events The customEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use customEvents to configure custom events. <customEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"/> Copy The CustomEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy Custom parameters The customParameters element is a child of the configuration element. Use customParameters to configure custom parameters. <customParameters enabled=\"true\" /> Copy The CustomParameters element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capture of custom parameters. Labels (tags) The labels element is a child of the configuration element. This sets tag names and values. The list is a semicolon delimited list of colon-separated name and value pairs. You can also use with the NEW_RELIC_LABELS environment variable. Example: <labels>foo:bar;zip:zap</labels> Copy Browser instrumentation The browserMonitoring element is a child of the configuration element. browserMonitoring configures Browser monitoring in your .NET application. Browser gives you insight your end users' performance experience. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your webpages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. // If you use both the Exclude and Attribute elements // the Exclude element must be listed first. <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </browserMonitoring> Copy The browserMonitoring element supports the following attributes: autoInstrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically injects the Browser agent JavaScript. To turn off automatic injection, set this attribute to false. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for Browser. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. requestPathsExcluded Use this sub-element to prevent the Browser agent from being injected in specific pages. The element is used as follows: <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> Copy The agent will not inject the Browser agent into pages whose URL matches one of the specified regular expressions. The regular expression should follow Microsoft guidelines for the Regex class. It is a reference to the virtual directory of the path in your application and not the full URL of the path you wish to exclude. For example, to exclude the pages in https://www.mywebsite.com/mywebpages/ you would simply insert /mywebpages/ as the path regex value. The requestPathsExcluded element should be used in cases where it is impossible or undesirable to use the DisableBrowserMonitoring() call. To minimize a possible performance impact try to use as few regular expressions as possible and keep them as simple as possible. Slow queries The slowSql element is a child of the configuration element. slowSql configures capturing information about slow query executions, and captures and obfuscates explain plans for these queries. <slowSql enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The slowSql element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable slow query tracing. Transaction traces The transactionTracer element is a child of the configuration element. transactionTracer configures transaction traces. Included in the trace is the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. <transactionTracer enabled=\"true\" transactionThreshold=\"apdex_f\" recordSql=\"obfuscated\" explainEnabled=\"true\" explainThreshold=\"500\" maxSegments=\"3000\" maxExplainPlans=\"20\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionTracer> Copy The transactionTracer element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable transaction traces. transactionThreshold Type String Default apdex_f Defines the threshold for transaction traces. If a transaction takes longer than the threshold, it is eligible for being traced. See transaction trace basics for more about the rules governing traces. The default value is apdex_f, which sets the threshold to four times the application's apdex_t value. For more information about apdex_t, see Apdex. You can also set the threshold to be a specific time value in milliseconds. recordSql Type String Default obfuscated Select a query tracing policy. Options are off, which records nothing; obfuscated, which records an obfuscated version of the query; or raw, which records the query exactly as it is issued to the database. Caution Recording raw queries may capture sensitive information. explainEnabled Type Boolean Default false When true, the agent captures EXPLAIN statements for slow queries. explainThreshold Type Integer Default 500 Unit Milliseconds The agent collects slow query data for queries that exceed this threshold, along with any available explain plans, as part of transaction traces. maxSegments Type Integer Default 3000 The maximum number of segments to collect in a transaction trace. maxExplainPlans Type Integer Default 20 The maximum number of explain plans to collect during a harvest cycle. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Datastore tracer The datastoreTracer element is a child of the configuration element. <datastoreTracer> <instanceReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <databaseNameReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <queryParameters enabled=\"false\" /> </datastoreTracer> Copy The datastoreTracer element supports the following sub-elements: instanceReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. databaseNameReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. The default value of attribute enabled is true. queryParameters Use this sub-element to enable collection of the SQL query parameters on slow query traces. The default value of attribute enabled is false. Caution Recording query parameters may capture sensitive information. The transactionTracer.recordSql configuration option must be set to raw or this option is ignored. Distributed tracing The distributedTracing element is a child of the configuration element. <distributedTracing enabled=\"false\" excludeNewrelicHeader=\"false\"/> Copy Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the planning guide. Important Requires .NET agent version 8.6.45.0 or higher. The distributedTracing element supports the following attributes: To enable or disable, see Enable distributed tracing. enabled Type Boolean Default false Alternatively, enable distributed tracing via the NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true Copy excludeNewrelicHeader Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing reports span events. Span event reporting is enabled by default, but distributed tracing must be enabled for spans to be reported. To disable span events, choose one of the following options: Disable span events via config file Set the <spanEvents> element to false to disable via the newrelic.config file. This element is a child of the <configuration> element. <configuration . . . > <spanEvents enabled=\"false\" /> </configuration> Copy Disable span events via environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false Copy Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing extends the distributed tracing service by employing a trace observer that is external to the agent. It observes 100% of your application traces across various services and provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. Important Infinite Tracing requires .NET Agent version 8.30 or higher. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional settings below <configuration . . . > <distributedTracing enabled=\"true\" /> <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer host=\"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" /> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy The infiniteTracing element supports the following elements: trace_observer The trace_observer element identifies an observer host that is independent from the agent. For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint. The trace observer may be configured using the NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST environment variable as well. Important When configuring the trace observer, you should not supply the protocol as part of the host. For example, use myhost.infinitetracing.com instead of https://myhost.infinitetracing.com. Span events The spanEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use spanEvents to configure span events. <spanEvents enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </spanEvents> Copy The spanEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for span events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to span events. Attribute settings may be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Settings in app.config or web.config For ASP.NET and .NET Framework console apps you can also configure the following settings in your app's app.config or web.config, within the outermost element, <configuration>: Enable and disable the agent <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"false\" /> </appSettings> Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AppName\" value =\"Descriptive Name\" /> </appSettings> Copy License key <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\" value =\"XXXXXXXX\" /> </appSettings> Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\" value=\"C:\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\newrelic.config\" /> </appSettings> Copy Settings in appsettings.json For .NET Core apps, you can configure the following settings in appsettings.json if the following is true: The appsettings.json file must be located in the current working directory of the application.

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation allows you to instrument parts of your app that are not instrumented automatically. This document describes how to instrument your app by decorating the methods in your app code with attributes. Use the Transaction attribute to create a custom transaction. You can also mark the custom transaction as a web transaction with the attribute's Web property. Use the Trace attribute to add custom instrumentation to methods that are invoked within a preexisting transaction. Requirements and recommendations Requirements include: .NET agent version 6.16.178.0 or higher. You must be willing to modify your source code. If you cannot or do not want to modify your source code, use custom instrumentation via XML. Your project must have a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll (for example, installing the package and placing using NewRelic.Api.Agent; in your code). This package is in the NuGet gallery. The Transaction and Trace attributes must be applied to concrete implementations of methods. They cannot be applied on interfaces or super class method definitions. Transactions called within transactions Methods decorated with the [Transaction] attribute will only create a new transaction when one does not already exist. When a method decorated with [Transaction] is called from within a previously started transaction, it will be treated as the [Trace] attribute instead, and will provide more information about the existing transaction. Example: Calling Transaction in an already-started transaction During the execution of this console application, OuterMethod will be called first and create a new transaction. The InnerMethod is called from within the transaction started by OuterMethod, so it will not create a new transaction. Instead, information about the execution of InnerMethod will be tracked as if the [Trace] attribute had been applied. static void Main(string[] args) { OuterMethod(); } [Transaction] public void OuterMethod() { InnerMethod(); } [Transaction] public void InnerMethod() { } Copy Create a new non-web transaction To start a non-web transaction (also known as a background request) with the Transaction attribute: [Transaction] public void Run() { // your background task } Copy For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Create a new web transaction To tell the agent to mark a non-web task as a web browser transaction, use either of these options: Set the Web property of the Transaction attribute to true. Set the transaction's URI with SetTransactionUri(). [Transaction(Web = true)] public void Run() { var uri = new Uri(\"http://www.mydomain.com/path\"); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.SetTransactionUri(uri); // your web task } Copy When used inside a previously started transaction, this will be treated as a [Trace] attribute. For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Add detail to existing transactions with Trace If your transaction traces show large blocks of un-instrumented time and you want to include additional methods within the trace, you can use the Trace attribute: [Trace] protected void MethodWithinTransaction() { // your app code } Copy Properties for [ Transaction] The Transaction attribute supports the following properties: Web Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent starts a web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. If a transaction is in progress, then that transaction will continue. If false (default), the agent starts a non-web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. For example: [Transaction(Web = true)] Copy Read forum posts about instrumentation For more specific recommendations, check out these posts in our Explorers Hub community: Troubleshoot attribute-based custom instrumentation issues Build custom instrumentation tracer factories from .NET agent log files Use other API functions For more about the .NET agent API and its functionality, see New Relic's .NET agent API guide.

      "body": "This document contains the configuration options for the APM .NET agent. Configuration overview APM agent configuration options allow you to control some aspects of how the agent behaves. Some of these config options are part of the basic install process (like setting your license key and app name), but most are more advanced settings, such as: setting a log level, setting up proxy host access, excluding certain attributes, and enabling distributed tracing. The .NET agent gets its configuration from the newrelic.config file, which is generated as part of the install process. By default, only a global newrelic.config file is created, but you can also create app-local newrelic.config files for finer control over a multi-app system. Other ways to set config options include: using environment variables, or setting server-side configuration from the UI. For more on the various config options and what overrides what, see Config settings precedence. Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core use the same configuration options and have the same APM features, unless otherwise stated. If you make changes to the config file and want to validate that it's in the right format, you can check it against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows) with any XSD validator. Important For IIS: after you change your newrelic.config or app.config file, perform an IISRESET from an administrative command prompt. Log level adjustments do not require a reset. Configuration methods and precedence levels Upon installation, the .NET agent's configuration file (newrelic.config) applies to all monitored applications, but you can configure the agent in other ways. Here's a diagram showing how different configuration options take precedence over one another: This diagram explains the order of precedence for different ways you might configure the .NET agent. Here are details about the configuration methods shown in the diagram, and their precedence levels: .NET configuration Details and precedence web.config or app.config or appsettings.json Configuration settings set in these files take highest precedence. However, if the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Environment variables Second-highest precedence. For more about these, see .NET environment variables. Server-side configuration Third-highest precedence. A limited number of server-side configuration settings are available; the other settings will come from other configuration sources. App-local newrelic.config Fourth-highest precedence. You can create app-local newrelic.config files to configure individual apps on a multi-app system. These local configuration files override settings in the global newrelic.config file. The agent looks for app-local config files in the following directories, in this order: A directory specified in your web.config or app.config file with the NewRelic.ConfigFile property The web app's root directory (with the app.config or web.config) The directory containing your app's executable file Note that the app-local config file must be complete and validate against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows). Default (global) newrelic.config Default source and the lowest precedence. Will configure all applications on a host in the absence of other config files. The global config file is located in the New Relic agent home directory: %PROGRAMDATA%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent Required environment variables New Relic's .NET agent relies on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to attach New Relic to your processes. Some .NET agent install procedures (like the MSI installer) will automatically set these variables for you; some procedures will require you to manually set them. Caution Security recommendation: You should consider what users can set system environment variables. You should also secure the accounts under which your applications execute to prevent user environment variables overriding system environment variables .NET Framework environment variables For .NET Framework, the following variables are required: COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. .NET Core environment variables For .NET Core, the following variables are required: Linux: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path/to/agent/directory CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=\"${CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME}/libNewRelicProfiler.so\" Copy Windows: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. If your system has previously used monitoring services (non-New Relic), you may have a \"profiler conflict\" when trying to install and use the New Relic agent. More details: Profiler conflict explanation New Relic’s .NET agents rely on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to load New Relic into your processes. The install-related environment variables are Microsoft variables, not New Relic variables. They can be used by other .NET profilers, and only one profiler can be attached to a process at a time. For this reason, if you have used previous application monitoring products, you may have profiler conflicts. For specific install instructions, see the .NET agent install documentation. Optional environment variables Some configuration options in New Relic's .NET agent can be set via environment variables as an alternative to setting them in a config file. Below is a list of environment variables recognized by the .NET agent with example values. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false NEW_RELIC_LABELS=foo:bar;zip:zap NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY=path\\to\\agent\\directory (not configurable via config file) Copy Setup options, newrelic.config Use these options to setup and configure your agent via the newrelic.config file. The New Relic .NET agent supports the following categories of setup options: Configuration element Service element Obscuring key element Proxy element Log element Application element (configuration) Data transmission element Host name Configuration element The root element of the configuration document is a configuration element. <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\" agentEnabled=\"true\" maxStackTraceLines=\"50\" timingPrecision=\"low\"> Copy The configuration element supports the following attributes: agentEnabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the New Relic agent. maxStackTraceLines Type Integer Default 80 The maximum number of stack frames to trace in any stack dump. timingPrecision Type String Default low Controls the precision of the timers. High precision will provide better data, but at a lower execution speed. Possible values are high and low. Service element The first child of the configuration element is a service element. The service element configures the agent's connection to the New Relic service. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" sendEnvironmentInfo=\"true\" syncStartup=\"false\" sendDataOnExit=\"false\" sendDataOnExitThreshold=\"60000\" autoStart=\"true\"/> Copy The service element supports the following attributes: licenseKey (required) Type String Default (none) Your New Relic license key. New Relic uses the license key to match your app's data to the correct account in the UI. Set the license key via environment variable. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX Copy sendEnvironmentInfo Type Boolean Default true Instructs the agent to record execution environment information. Environment information includes operating system, agent version, and which assemblies are available. syncStartup Type Boolean Default false Block application startup until the agent connects to New Relic. If set to true, the first transaction may take substantially longer to complete, because it is blocked until the connection to New Relic is finished. sendDataOnExit Type Boolean Default false Block application shutdown until the agent sends all data from the latest harvest cycle. sendDataOnExitThreshold Type Integer Default 60000 Unit Milliseconds The minimum amount of time the process must run before the agent blocks it from shutting down. This setting only applies when sendDataOnExit is true. completeTransactionsOnThread Type Boolean Default false If false, the agent uses a pool thread to complete the transaction processing. If true, the agent will complete transaction processing on the request thread. requestTimeout Type Integer Default 2000 (sendDataOnExit enabled) 120000 (sendDataOnExit disabled) Unit Milliseconds The agent's request timeout when communicating with New Relic. autoStart Type Boolean Default True Automatically start the .NET agent when the first instrumented method is hit. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true The option to disable SSL is valid only for .NET agent versions 7.x and earlier. .NET agent version 8.x and higher communicate only via SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. Obscuring key element The obscuringKey element is an optional child of the service element. The .NET Agent uses this value to deobfuscate supported configuration values. For example, when an obfuscated proxy password is supplied, it will be deobfuscated using this key. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <obscuringKey>OBSCURING_KEY</obscuringKey> </service> Copy The obscuring key may also be configured by setting the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY environment variable. Caution Security recommendation: The placement of the obscuring Key in the same configuration file as an obfuscated value may pose a security risk. Consider placing the obscuring key in an environment variable and limiting access to environment variables within your environment. Proxy element The proxy element is an optional child of the service element. The proxy element is used when the agent communicates to the New Relic back-end service via a proxy. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <proxy host=\"hostname\" port=\"PROXY_PORT\" uriPath=\"path/to/something.aspx\" domain=\"mydomain.com\" user=\"PROXY_USERNAME\" password=\"PROXY_PASSWORD\" passwordObfuscated=\"OBFUSCATED_PROXY_PASSWORD\"/> </service> Copy The proxy element supports the following attributes: host Type String Default (none) Defines the proxy host. port Type Integer Default 8080 Defines the proxy port. uriPath Type String Default (none) Optionally define a proxy URI path. domain Type String Default (none) Optionally define a domain to use when authenticating with the proxy server. user Type String Default (none) Optionally define a user name for authentication. password Type String Default (none) Optionally define a password for authentication. passwordObfuscated Type String Default (none) For additional security, the .NET Agent supports the use of an obfuscated proxy password with the passwordObfuscated attribute. The obfuscated proxy password is generated using the following New Relic CLI command: newrelic agent config obfuscate --key OBSCURING_KEY --value \"CLEAR_TEXT_PROXY_PASSWORD\" Copy Important When using an obfuscated proxy password, the obscuring key must also be configured. Log element The log element is a child of the configuration element. The log element configures New Relic's logging . The agent generates its own log file to keep its logging information separate from your application's logs. <log level=\"info\" auditLog=\"false\" console=\"false\" directory=\"PATH\\TO\\LOG\\DIRECTORY\" fileName=\"FILENAME.log\" /> Copy The log element supports the following attributes: level Type String Default info Defines the level of detail recorded in the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: off error warn info debug finest all Important Increasing the log level will increase New Relic's performance impact. auditLog Type Boolean Default false Records all data sent to and received from New Relic in both an auditlog log file and the standard log file. console Type Boolean Default false Send log messages to the console, in addition to the log file. directory Type String Default C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs The directory to hold log files generated by the agent. If this is omitted, then a directory named logs in the New Relic agent install area will be used by default. fileName Type String Default (none) Defines a name for the log file. If you do not define a fileName, the name is derived from the name of the monitored process. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log Copy Application element (required) The application element is a child of the configuration element. This required element defines your application name, and disables or enables sampling. name Type String Default My Application The name of your .NET application is a child of the application element. New Relic will aggregate your data according to this name. For example, if you have two running applications named AppA and AppB, you will see two applications in the New Relic interface: AppA and AppB. You can also assign up to three names to your app. The first name is the primary name. For example: <application> <name>MY APPLICATION PRIMARY</name> <name>SECOND APP NAME</name> <name>THIRD APP NAME</name> </application> Copy Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name Copy disableSamplers Type Boolean Default false Samplers collect information about memory and CPU consumption. Set this to true to disable sampling. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true Copy Data transmission element The dataTransmission element is a child of the configuration element. This element affects how data is sent to New Relic and can be used if you have specific data transmission requirements. <dataTransmission putForDataSend=\"false\" compressedContentEncoding=\"deflate\"/> Copy The dataTransmission element supports the following attributes: putForDataSend Type Boolean Default false Defines the HTTP method used when sending data to New Relic. Set this to true to enable using the PUT method when sending data. The POST method is used by default. Host name If the default host name label in the APM UI is not useful, you can decorate that name in the New Relic UI with a display name. After the application process is restarted and the .NET agent is reporting again, the display name will appear in the Servers drop-down list. This host name setting does not affect the list of hosts on your application's Summary page. To set a display name, choose one of the following options. The environment variable takes precedence over the config file value. Then restart your application to see your changes in the New Relic UI. Set using config file Set the displayName attribute in the processHost element in newrelic.config. The processHost element is a child of the configuration element. <configuration . . . > <processHost displayName=\"CUSTOM_NAME\" /> </configuration> Copy Set using environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME environment variable: NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME = \"CUSTOM_NAME\" Copy Cloud platform utilization Configures the utilization configuration element to control how the agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service to determine pricing. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances, Docker containers, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and Kubernetes. detectAws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detectAzure Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Azure metadata API. detectGcp Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls GCP metadata API. detectPcf Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls PCF information from environment variables. detectDocker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. detectKubernetes Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Kubernetes information from environment variables. Instrumentation options Use these options to configure which elements of your application and environment to instrument. New Relic for .NET supports the following categories of instrumentation options: Instrumentation element Applications element (instrumentation) Attributes element Instrumentation element The instrumentation element is a child of the configuration element. By default, the .NET agent instruments IIS asp worker processes and Azure web and worker roles. To instrument other processes, see Instrumenting custom applications. Applications element (instrumentation) The applications element is a child of the instrumentation element. The applications element specifies which non-web apps to instrument. It contains a name attribute. Important This is not the same as the application (configuration) element, which is a child of the configuration element. <instrumentation> <applications> <application name=\"MyService1.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService2.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService3.exe\" /> </applications> </instrumentation> Copy Attributes element An attribute is a key/value pair that determines the properties of an event or transaction. Each attribute is sent to APM transaction traces, APM error traces, Transaction events, TransactionError events, or PageView events. The primary attributes element enables or disables attribute collection for the .NET agent, and defines specific attributes to collect or exclude. You can also configure attribute settings based on their destination: Error collection, transaction traces, Browser instrumentation, and transaction events. In this example, the agent excludes all attributes whose key begins with myApiKey (myApiKey.bar, myApiKey.value), but collects the custom attribute myApiKey.foo. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> Copy You can view the .NET APM attributes on the .NET agent attributes page. You can also define custom attributes with the agent API call AddCustomParameter. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable attribute collection. When set to false in the primary attribute element, this setting overrides all attribute settings for individual destinations. include Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will collect all attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. exclude Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will not collect attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. Feature options Use these options to enable, disable, and configure New Relic features. New Relic for .NET allows you to configure the following features: App pools Cross application traces Error collection High security mode Strip exception messages Transaction events Custom events Custom parameters Tags/labels Browser instrumentation Slow Queries Transaction traces Datastore tracer Distributed tracing Span events App pools Important This is only applicable to a system's global config file. The applicationPools element is a child of the configuration element. The applicationPools element specifies for the profiler exactly which application pools to instrument and uses the same name as the IIS application pool name. This configuration element is useful when you may need to instrument only a small subset of your app pools. For example, a given server might have several hundred application pools, but only a few of those pools need to be instrumented by the .NET agent. Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"false\"/> </applicationPools> Copy Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for all application pools currently executing on the server and enabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <defaultBehavior instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"true\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"true\"/> </applicationPools> Copy The applicationPools element supports the following elements: defaultBehavior Type Boolean Default false Defines how the .NET agent will behave on a \"global\" level for application pools served via IIS. The .NET agent instruments all application pools by default. When true, application pools listed under applicationPool with an instrument attribute set to false will not be instrumented. Essentially, when set to false, the application pool list acts as an allow list. When set to true, the application pool list acts as a deny list. applicationPool Defines instrumentation behavior for a specific application pool. The name attribute is the name of an application pool. Enable or disable profiling in the instrument attribute. Define this application in the name attribute. Cross application traces The crossApplicationTracer element is a child of the configuration element. crossApplicationTracer links transaction traces across applications. When linked in a service-oriented architecture, all instrumented applications that communicate with each other via HTTP will now \"link\" transaction traces with the applications that they call and the applications they are called by. Cross application tracing makes it easier to understand the performance relationship between services and applications. <crossApplicationTracer enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The crossApplicationTracer element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable cross application tracing Error collection The errorCollector element is a child of the configuration element. errorCollector configures error collection, which captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic. <errorCollector enabled=\"true\" captureEvents=\"true\" maxEventSamplesStored=\"100\"> <ignoreClasses> <errorClass>System.IO.FileNotFoundException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.Threading.ThreadAbortException</errorClass> </ignoreClasses> <ignoreMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Ignore message</message> <message>Ignore too</message> </errorClass> </ignoreMessages> <ignoreStatusCodes> <code>401</code> <code>404</code> </ignoreStatusCodes> <expectedClasses> <errorClass>System.ArgumentNullException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException</errorClass> </expectedClasses> <expectedMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Expected message</message> <message>Expected too</message> </errorClass> </expectedMessages> <expectedStatusCodes>403,500-505</expectedStatusCodes> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </errorCollector> Copy Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. The errorCollector element supports the following elements and attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the error collector. captureEvents Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capturing of error events. maxEventSamplesStored Type Integer Default 100 Reservoir limit for error events. ignoreClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be ignored. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreErrors (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Lists specific exceptions to not report to New Relic. The full name of the exception should be used, such as System.IO.FileNotFoundException. ignoreStatusCodes Type String Default (none) Lists specific HTTP error codes to not report to New Relic. You can use standard integral HTTP error codes, such as just 401, or you may use Microsoft full status codes with decimal points, such as 401.4 or 403.18. The status codes should be equal to or greater than 400. expectedClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be marked as expected. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedStatusCodes A comma separated list of status codes. The list may include integer ranges, using a single dash (-) and will be inclusive of both the starting and ending integer in the range. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for error traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. High security mode The highSecurity element is a child of the configuration element. To enable high security mode, set this property to true and enable high security property in the New Relic user interface. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request parameters and custom parameters are not collected, strip exception messages is enabled, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable high security mode. Example: <highSecurity enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Strip exception messages The stripExceptionMessages element is a child of the configuration element. To enable strip exception messages, set this property to true. By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically changed to true, and the agent strips the messages from exceptions. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable strip exception messages. Example: <stripExceptionMessages enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Transaction events The transactionEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use transactionEvents to configure transaction events. <transactionEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionEvents> Copy The transactionEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to transaction events. Attribute settings can be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Caution When distributed tracing and/or Infinite Tracing are enabled, information from transaction events is applied to the root Span Event of the transaction. Consider applying any attribute settings for transaction events to span events and/or apply them as Global Attribute settings. Custom events The customEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use customEvents to configure custom events. <customEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"/> Copy The CustomEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy Custom parameters The customParameters element is a child of the configuration element. Use customParameters to configure custom parameters. <customParameters enabled=\"true\" /> Copy The CustomParameters element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capture of custom parameters. Labels (tags) The labels element is a child of the configuration element. This sets tag names and values. The list is a semicolon delimited list of colon-separated name and value pairs. You can also use with the NEW_RELIC_LABELS environment variable. Example: <labels>foo:bar;zip:zap</labels> Copy Browser instrumentation The browserMonitoring element is a child of the configuration element. browserMonitoring configures Browser monitoring in your .NET application. Browser gives you insight your end users' performance experience. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your webpages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. // If you use both the Exclude and Attribute elements // the Exclude element must be listed first. <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </browserMonitoring> Copy The browserMonitoring element supports the following attributes: autoInstrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically injects the Browser agent JavaScript. To turn off automatic injection, set this attribute to false. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for Browser. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. requestPathsExcluded Use this sub-element to prevent the Browser agent from being injected in specific pages. The element is used as follows: <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> Copy The agent will not inject the Browser agent into pages whose URL matches one of the specified regular expressions. The regular expression should follow Microsoft guidelines for the Regex class. It is a reference to the virtual directory of the path in your application and not the full URL of the path you wish to exclude. For example, to exclude the pages in https://www.mywebsite.com/mywebpages/ you would simply insert /mywebpages/ as the path regex value. The requestPathsExcluded element should be used in cases where it is impossible or undesirable to use the DisableBrowserMonitoring() call. To minimize a possible performance impact try to use as few regular expressions as possible and keep them as simple as possible. Slow queries The slowSql element is a child of the configuration element. slowSql configures capturing information about slow query executions, and captures and obfuscates explain plans for these queries. <slowSql enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The slowSql element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable slow query tracing. Transaction traces The transactionTracer element is a child of the configuration element. transactionTracer configures transaction traces. Included in the trace is the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. <transactionTracer enabled=\"true\" transactionThreshold=\"apdex_f\" recordSql=\"obfuscated\" explainEnabled=\"true\" explainThreshold=\"500\" maxSegments=\"3000\" maxExplainPlans=\"20\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionTracer> Copy The transactionTracer element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable transaction traces. transactionThreshold Type String Default apdex_f Defines the threshold for transaction traces. If a transaction takes longer than the threshold, it is eligible for being traced. See transaction trace basics for more about the rules governing traces. The default value is apdex_f, which sets the threshold to four times the application's apdex_t value. For more information about apdex_t, see Apdex. You can also set the threshold to be a specific time value in milliseconds. recordSql Type String Default obfuscated Select a query tracing policy. Options are off, which records nothing; obfuscated, which records an obfuscated version of the query; or raw, which records the query exactly as it is issued to the database. Caution Recording raw queries may capture sensitive information. explainEnabled Type Boolean Default false When true, the agent captures EXPLAIN statements for slow queries. explainThreshold Type Integer Default 500 Unit Milliseconds The agent collects slow query data for queries that exceed this threshold, along with any available explain plans, as part of transaction traces. maxSegments Type Integer Default 3000 The maximum number of segments to collect in a transaction trace. maxExplainPlans Type Integer Default 20 The maximum number of explain plans to collect during a harvest cycle. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Datastore tracer The datastoreTracer element is a child of the configuration element. <datastoreTracer> <instanceReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <databaseNameReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <queryParameters enabled=\"false\" /> </datastoreTracer> Copy The datastoreTracer element supports the following sub-elements: instanceReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. databaseNameReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. The default value of attribute enabled is true. queryParameters Use this sub-element to enable collection of the SQL query parameters on slow query traces. The default value of attribute enabled is false. Caution Recording query parameters may capture sensitive information. The transactionTracer.recordSql configuration option must be set to raw or this option is ignored. Distributed tracing The distributedTracing element is a child of the configuration element. <distributedTracing enabled=\"false\" excludeNewrelicHeader=\"false\"/> Copy Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the planning guide. Important Requires .NET agent version 8.6.45.0 or higher. The distributedTracing element supports the following attributes: To enable or disable, see Enable distributed tracing. enabled Type Boolean Default false Alternatively, enable distributed tracing via the NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true Copy excludeNewrelicHeader Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing reports span events. Span event reporting is enabled by default, but distributed tracing must be enabled for spans to be reported. To disable span events, choose one of the following options: Disable span events via config file Set the <spanEvents> element to false to disable via the newrelic.config file. This element is a child of the <configuration> element. <configuration . . . > <spanEvents enabled=\"false\" /> </configuration> Copy Disable span events via environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false Copy Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing extends the distributed tracing service by employing a trace observer that is external to the agent. It observes 100% of your application traces across various services and provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. Important Infinite Tracing requires .NET Agent version 8.30 or higher. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional settings below <configuration . . . > <distributedTracing enabled=\"true\" /> <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer host=\"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" /> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy The infiniteTracing element supports the following elements: trace_observer The trace_observer element identifies an observer host that is independent from the agent. For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint. The trace observer may be configured using the NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST environment variable as well. Important When configuring the trace observer, you should not supply the protocol as part of the host. For example, use myhost.infinitetracing.com instead of https://myhost.infinitetracing.com. Span events The spanEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use spanEvents to configure span events. <spanEvents enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </spanEvents> Copy The spanEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for span events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to span events. Attribute settings may be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Settings in app.config or web.config For ASP.NET and .NET Framework console apps you can also configure the following settings in your app's app.config or web.config, within the outermost element, <configuration>: Enable and disable the agent <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"false\" /> </appSettings> Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AppName\" value =\"Descriptive Name\" /> </appSettings> Copy License key <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\" value =\"XXXXXXXX\" /> </appSettings> Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\" value=\"C:\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\newrelic.config\" /> </appSettings> Copy Settings in appsettings.json For .NET Core apps, you can configure the following settings in appsettings.json if the following is true: The appsettings.json file must be located in the current working directory of the application. The application must have the following dependencies: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.EnvironmentVariables Enable and disable the agent { \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\":\"false\" } Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled setting in this file will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. { \"NewRelic.AppName\": \"Descriptive Name\" } Copy License key { \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\": \"XXXXXXXX\" } Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location.

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation allows you to instrument parts of your app that are not instrumented automatically. This document describes how to instrument your app by decorating the methods in your app code with attributes. Use the Transaction attribute to create a custom transaction. You can also mark the custom transaction as a web transaction with the attribute's Web property. Use the Trace attribute to add custom instrumentation to methods that are invoked within a preexisting transaction. Requirements and recommendations Requirements include: .NET agent version 6.16.178.0 or higher. You must be willing to modify your source code. If you cannot or do not want to modify your source code, use custom instrumentation via XML. Your project must have a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll (for example, installing the package and placing using NewRelic.Api.Agent; in your code). This package is in the NuGet gallery. The Transaction and Trace attributes must be applied to concrete implementations of methods. They cannot be applied on interfaces or super class method definitions. Transactions called within transactions Methods decorated with the [Transaction] attribute will only create a new transaction when one does not already exist. When a method decorated with [Transaction] is called from within a previously started transaction, it will be treated as the [Trace] attribute instead, and will provide more information about the existing transaction. Example: Calling Transaction in an already-started transaction During the execution of this console application, OuterMethod will be called first and create a new transaction. The InnerMethod is called from within the transaction started by OuterMethod, so it will not create a new transaction. Instead, information about the execution of InnerMethod will be tracked as if the [Trace] attribute had been applied. static void Main(string[] args) { OuterMethod(); } [Transaction] public void OuterMethod() { InnerMethod(); } [Transaction] public void InnerMethod() { } Copy Create a new non-web transaction To start a non-web transaction (also known as a background request) with the Transaction attribute: [Transaction] public void Run() { // your background task } Copy For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Create a new web transaction To tell the agent to mark a non-web task as a web browser transaction, use either of these options: Set the Web property of the Transaction attribute to true. Set the transaction's URI with SetTransactionUri().

      "body": "This document explains how to install APM's .NET agent on Microsoft's Azure Cloud Services platform. This is not the same as installing the Infrastructure integrations for Microsoft Azure. To make sure you are using the most relevant instructions, first see the .NET agent install overview. Important Before installing the NuGet package into a multi-project Visual Studio solution, make sure you have selected the correct project for your New Relic .NET application (for example, a specific website project). Check Web or Worker role's location If Service files are nested within a Solution folder, the NuGet installer cannot locate or update the necessary files. This will cause issues with the .NET agent setup, which will in turn prevent the agent from reporting metrics on your Cloud Service. Recommendation: Place the Web or Worker role at the root of the solution before installing the NuGet package. Once the New Relic .NET agent is installed, you can move the Cloud role back into the Solution folder. Install the NuGet package for Cloud Services Important The NuGet packages in this procedure support only the old packages.config. They do not support the new PackageReference format. For more information see Microsoft's package reference documentation For multi-project solutions, make sure you have selected the correct project (for example, a specific website project) before installing the NuGet package. Open your Visual Studio solution, or create a new one by selecting File > New > Project. For multi-project solutions, make sure you have selected the correct project (for example, a specific website project). If you do not already have an Azure Cloud Service project in your solution, add one by right-clicking your app in the Solution Explorer and selecting Add Windows Azure Cloud Service Project. Open the Package Manager console by selecting Tools > Library Package Manager > Package Manager Console. Set your project as the default project. From the Package Manager command prompt, type Install-Package NewRelicWindowsAzure and press Enter. Follow the prompts to enter your New Relic license key and your application name as you want it to appear in the New Relic UI. Or, use your solution name as the default app name. From the Solution Explorer, right-click your Azure Cloud Service project, and select Publish. If this is your first time deploying this app to Azure, enter your Azure credentials. If applicable, instrument methods for Worker roles. Instrument Worker role A Worker role is a non-web process run as an Azure Cloud Service. To instrument a Worker role, you must create custom transactions. The .NET agent automatically instruments external calls and database calls, but it does not instrument default methods for transactions. Creating custom transactions solves this. After the Worker role starts up and the method executes, transaction data will appear in the APM Summary and Transactions pages under the Non-web category. The NuGet installer automatically adds the NewRelic.AppName parameter to the application config. This appears as <YOUR_WORKER_ROLE_NAME>.dll.config in E:\\approot. The .NET agent also automatically instruments WaWorkerHost.exe. This is the name of the actual Worker role process. Custom instrumentation example for Worker role This is a custom instrumentation example for a Worker role. It creates a custom transaction named ProcessMessage. The transaction begins when the ProcessMessage method is entered, and it ends when the method returns. The following example uses MyWorkerRole as the namespace. If you do not specify a name, it will default to the Solution name. namespace MyWorkerRole { public class NotificationQueue { public bool ProcessMessage(Message message) { // code to process message } } } Copy Here is the custom instrumentation file for the code: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-extension\"> <instrumentation> <tracerfactory name=\"NewRelic.Agent.Core.Tracer.Factories.BackgroundThreadTracerFactory\" metricName=\"Custom/ProcessMessage\"> <match assemblyname=\"MyWorkerRole\" classname=\"MyWorkerRole.NotificationQueue\"> <exactmethodmatcher methodName=\"ProcessMessage\" /> </match> </tracerfactory> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy On a local installation, place this instrumentation file in C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Extensions. Custom instrumentation file deployment Optional: To send the custom instrumentation file up with an Azure Cloud Service deployment: In your Azure Cloud project, add the instrumentation file to your Worker role inside the Roles folder. After installing the New Relic .NET agent NuGet package, locate newrelic.cmd in your Worker Role project. Find the statement IF %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 within the :INSTALL_NEWRELIC_AGENT block, and add the following statement to the conditional: IF %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 ( copy /Y \"%RoleRoot%\\approot\\MyInstrumentation.xml\" \"%NR_HOME%\\extensions\" >> %RoleRoot%\\nr.log ) ELSE ( Copy In this example, the newrelic.cmd batch file copies the custom instrumentation file to the Extensions folder in D:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\, or %NR_HOME%. This example uses MyInstrumentation.xml, but any name will work as long as the file name and copy command match, and the file is valid XML. Optional: Create custom config file You can create a custom configuration file in Visual Studio. This allows you to make changes to newrelic.config inside Visual Studio, without having to remote into your Azure Role instance every time you make a change. Whenever you publish your app, the config file in Visual Studio is automatically uploaded to the remote host. The choices you make with the installation wizard do not matter. Installing locally does not affect your Azure development environment. In Visual Studio, select the Solution Explorer, then open NewRelicAgent_x64_XYZ.msi. Follow the steps to install the agent locally. Import newrelic.config into your project: In Solution Explorer > Cloud Project, right-click the Web Role, then select Add > Existing Item. Navigate to C: \\ ProgramData \\ New Relic \\ .NET Agent and select newrelic.config. From C: \\ ProgramData \\ New Relic \\ .NET Agent, edit newrelic.cmd. In the :INSTALL_NEWRELIC_AGENT section, find this statement: IF $ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 ( Copy Add the following code as another statement inside the IF block, then save the file: copy /Y \"%RoleRoot%\\approot\\newrelic.config\" \"%NR_HOME%\" >> %RoleRoot%\\nr.log Copy You can now edit the newrelic.config hosted in Visual Studio. Whenever you publish your app, the copy command will upload the config file to the remote host. View your app's performance Your application must receive traffic in order for you to view its performance in New Relic. You may need to wait a few minutes for data to start appearing.

Recommendation: Before following these instructions, read the .NET agent installation overview. Installation options Tip To use .NET or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use any of the following methods to add the New Relic .NET agent to your Azure-deployed web app. The best option depends on your role, environment, deployments, etc. For example: For operations teams that need to monitor the app, best practice may be to: Install using the Azure Site Extension For developer teams, best practice may be to use NuGet: Install using NuGet (.NET Framework) Install using NuGet (.NET Core) In order to monitor non-web apps (including WebJobs), or ASP.NET Core apps targeting .NET Framework, you must explicitly enable the agent for that application's .exe process via one of these two methods: Enable via placement of local newrelic.config file. Enable via application config file In addition, WebJobs may need custom instrumentation for transactions to appear in APM, and additional configuration if they run for less than one minute. Disable Application Insights Both New Relic's .NET agent and Microsoft Application Insights rely on the CLR Profiler, but only one may be active at a time. You must disable Application Insights in order for the .NET agent to function properly. For more information, see our Application Insights troubleshooting procedures. Install using the New Relic Azure Site Extension To install the .NET agent for an Azure Web App using the New Relic Azure Site Extension: Shut down your web application before installing the New Relic Azure Site Extension. Add the site extension: Navigate to http://[yoursitename].scm.azurewebsites.net, then select Site extensions > Gallery. Select the plus icon next to the New Relic site extension. In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app to use the new version of the agent. Install using NuGet (.NET Framework) The NuGet packages in this procedure support only the old packages.config. They do not support the current PackageReference format. For more information, see Microsoft's package reference documentation. For multi-project solutions, make sure you have selected the correct project (for example, a specific web app project) before installing the NuGet package. If you are upgrading the .NET Framework agent using NuGet, any changes you made in the newrelic.config will be overwritten. To preserve any changes, save your newrelic.config outside of your project, then restore it after upgrading. To install the .NET agent on an Azure Web App using NuGet: In the Azure portal, verify your Azure Platform (32-bit or 64-bit): From the Azure sidebar menu, select App Services > Your Application > Settings > Configuration > General settings. Open your application in Visual Studio, and install the New Relic NuGet package by running the appropriate command from the Package manager console: 32-bit: Install-Package NewRelic.Azure.WebSites 64-bit: Install-Package NewRelic.Azure.WebSites.x64 Publish your application. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Settings > Configuration. From Configuration, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Key Value COR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 COR_PROFILER {71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} COR_PROFILER_PATH D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll NEWRELIC_HOME D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app. Install using NuGet (.NET Core) New Relic .NET Core agent supports Linux and Windows applications on Azure App Services. The installation process for Azure App Services differs from the .NET Core agent installation procedures for Linux and Windows. To install the .NET agent on an Azure Web App using NuGet: Install the NewRelic.Agent NuGet package. Modify the log node by adding a directory attribute to your newrelic.config file: Log file configuration for Windows log directory=\"D:\\Home\\LogFiles\\NewRelic\" level=\"info\"/log Copy Log file configuration for Linux log directory=\"/home/LogFiles/NewRelic\" level=\"info\"/log Copy Publish your application.

Restart your web app. Add New Relic app settings to Azure App Services To add your app settings: Make sure you have your license key before adding the New Relic .NET agent's app settings. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Configuration > Application settings. From Application settings, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Key Value NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY YOUR_LICENSE_KEY NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME YOUR_APP_NAME Save and restart your web app. Setting the license key and app name with Application settings will override the newrelic.config. To verify your app's environment variables in your app's Kudu diagnostic console, go to Environment > Environment variables. For example: https://myappname.scm.azurewebsites.net/Env.cshtml#envVariables Copy View your app's performance Your application must receive traffic in order for you to view its performance in New Relic.

This is not the same as installing the Infrastructure integrations for Microsoft Azure. Install .NET agent on Azure Service Fabric Important In most cases, installing the .NET agent in an Azure Service Fabric environment can be performed using the standard install procedures for either Windows or Linux. This document highlights some alternate ways you can install the agent. You will need to ensure the agent gets installed on all nodes in your cluster. To monitor multiple nodes, you may want to integrate the install into your deployment process. If you are using containers in your Service Fabric environment you should read Install for Docker. You can also install the agent in a Service Fabric environment using NuGet. NuGet is often a good option for developers because the agent gets deployed along with your application. Though, using NuGet requires some manual installation procedures. See Install with NuGet. Install using NuGet To install the .NET agent using NuGet: Follow the standard NuGet install procedures. When using NuGet, you must set some environment variables. This can be done in your application's ServiceManifest.xml file.

      "body": "This document explains how to install New Relic's .NET agent for application performance monitoring on your Azure Web App. (This is not the same as installing the infrastructure monitoring integrations for Microsoft Azure.) Recommendation: Before following these instructions, read the .NET agent installation overview. Installation options Tip To use .NET or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use any of the following methods to add the New Relic .NET agent to your Azure-deployed web app. The best option depends on your role, environment, deployments, etc. For example: For operations teams that need to monitor the app, best practice may be to: Install using the Azure Site Extension For developer teams, best practice may be to use NuGet: Install using NuGet (.NET Framework) Install using NuGet (.NET Core) In order to monitor non-web apps (including WebJobs), or ASP.NET Core apps targeting .NET Framework, you must explicitly enable the agent for that application's .exe process via one of these two methods: Enable via placement of local newrelic.config file. Enable via application config file In addition, WebJobs may need custom instrumentation for transactions to appear in APM, and additional configuration if they run for less than one minute. Disable Application Insights Both New Relic's .NET agent and Microsoft Application Insights rely on the CLR Profiler, but only one may be active at a time. You must disable Application Insights in order for the .NET agent to function properly. For more information, see our Application Insights troubleshooting procedures. Install using the New Relic Azure Site Extension To install the .NET agent for an Azure Web App using the New Relic Azure Site Extension: Shut down your web application before installing the New Relic Azure Site Extension. Add the site extension: Navigate to http://[yoursitename].scm.azurewebsites.net, then select Site extensions > Gallery. Select the plus icon next to the New Relic site extension. In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app to use the new version of the agent. Install using NuGet (.NET Framework) The NuGet packages in this procedure support only the old packages.config. They do not support the current PackageReference format. For more information, see Microsoft's package reference documentation. For multi-project solutions, make sure you have selected the correct project (for example, a specific web app project) before installing the NuGet package. If you are upgrading the .NET Framework agent using NuGet, any changes you made in the newrelic.config will be overwritten. To preserve any changes, save your newrelic.config outside of your project, then restore it after upgrading. To install the .NET agent on an Azure Web App using NuGet: In the Azure portal, verify your Azure Platform (32-bit or 64-bit): From the Azure sidebar menu, select App Services > Your Application > Settings > Configuration > General settings. Open your application in Visual Studio, and install the New Relic NuGet package by running the appropriate command from the Package manager console: 32-bit: Install-Package NewRelic.Azure.WebSites 64-bit: Install-Package NewRelic.Azure.WebSites.x64 Publish your application. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Settings > Configuration. From Configuration, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Key Value COR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 COR_PROFILER {71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} COR_PROFILER_PATH D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll NEWRELIC_HOME D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app. Install using NuGet (.NET Core) New Relic .NET Core agent supports Linux and Windows applications on Azure App Services. The installation process for Azure App Services differs from the .NET Core agent installation procedures for Linux and Windows. To install the .NET agent on an Azure Web App using NuGet: Install the NewRelic.Agent NuGet package. Modify the log node by adding a directory attribute to your newrelic.config file: Log file configuration for Windows log directory=\"D:\\Home\\LogFiles\\NewRelic\" level=\"info\"/log Copy Log file configuration for Linux log directory=\"/home/LogFiles/NewRelic\" level=\"info\"/log Copy Publish your application. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Settings > Configuration. From Configuration, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Environment variables for Windows Key Value CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 CORECLR_PROFILER {36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH_32 D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\x86\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH_64 D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic Environment variables for Linux Key Value CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 CORECLR_PROFILER {36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH /home/site/wwwroot/newrelic/libNewRelicProfiler.so CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME /home/site/wwwroot/newrelic In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app. Add New Relic app settings to Azure App Services To add your app settings: Make sure you have your license key before adding the New Relic .NET agent's app settings. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Configuration > Application settings. From Application settings, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Key Value NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY YOUR_LICENSE_KEY NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME YOUR_APP_NAME Save and restart your web app. Setting the license key and app name with Application settings will override the newrelic.config. To verify your app's environment variables in your app's Kudu diagnostic console, go to Environment > Environment variables. For example: https://myappname.scm.azurewebsites.net/Env.cshtml#envVariables Copy View your app's performance Your application must receive traffic in order for you to view its performance in New Relic. You may need to wait a few minutes for data to start appearing. If no data appears, see the troubleshooting procedures for Azure Web Apps. To view your app's performance in New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). The APM Summary page automatically appears. You can also view detailed information about errors, database and instance performance issues, and more. If you created your New Relic app prior to October 2017, you can use the Azure portal to select the New Relic account blade. You will be automatically logged in with SAML Single Sign-on (SSO) to APM. You can also view your application's error rate and throughput data in the Azure portal by going to New Relic Accounts > (select your app). Troubleshooting If no data appears after installing the agent, generating traffic for your app, and waiting a few minutes, try these troubleshooting tips: Make sure that all files in the newrelic directory at the root of your app got published to Azure. Make sure the environment variables are set correctly. Make sure Microsoft Application Insights is not installed and configured on the application. For more information, see the Application Insights troubleshooting procedures. Refer to additional Azure troubleshooting procedures as applicable.",

      "body": "This document explains how to install APM's .NET agent on Microsoft's Azure Cloud Services platform. This is not the same as installing the Infrastructure integrations for Microsoft Azure. To make sure you are using the most relevant instructions, first see the .NET agent install overview. Important Before installing the NuGet package into a multi-project Visual Studio solution, make sure you have selected the correct project for your New Relic .NET application (for example, a specific website project). Check Web or Worker role's location If Service files are nested within a Solution folder, the NuGet installer cannot locate or update the necessary files. This will cause issues with the .NET agent setup, which will in turn prevent the agent from reporting metrics on your Cloud Service. Recommendation: Place the Web or Worker role at the root of the solution before installing the NuGet package. Once the New Relic .NET agent is installed, you can move the Cloud role back into the Solution folder. Install the NuGet package for Cloud Services Important The NuGet packages in this procedure support only the old packages.config. They do not support the new PackageReference format. For more information see Microsoft's package reference documentation For multi-project solutions, make sure you have selected the correct project (for example, a specific website project) before installing the NuGet package. Open your Visual Studio solution, or create a new one by selecting File > New > Project. For multi-project solutions, make sure you have selected the correct project (for example, a specific website project). If you do not already have an Azure Cloud Service project in your solution, add one by right-clicking your app in the Solution Explorer and selecting Add Windows Azure Cloud Service Project. Open the Package Manager console by selecting Tools > Library Package Manager > Package Manager Console. Set your project as the default project. From the Package Manager command prompt, type Install-Package NewRelicWindowsAzure and press Enter. Follow the prompts to enter your New Relic license key and your application name as you want it to appear in the New Relic UI. Or, use your solution name as the default app name. From the Solution Explorer, right-click your Azure Cloud Service project, and select Publish. If this is your first time deploying this app to Azure, enter your Azure credentials. If applicable, instrument methods for Worker roles. Instrument Worker role A Worker role is a non-web process run as an Azure Cloud Service. To instrument a Worker role, you must create custom transactions. The .NET agent automatically instruments external calls and database calls, but it does not instrument default methods for transactions. Creating custom transactions solves this. After the Worker role starts up and the method executes, transaction data will appear in the APM Summary and Transactions pages under the Non-web category. The NuGet installer automatically adds the NewRelic.AppName parameter to the application config. This appears as <YOUR_WORKER_ROLE_NAME>.dll.config in E:\\approot. The .NET agent also automatically instruments WaWorkerHost.exe. This is the name of the actual Worker role process. Custom instrumentation example for Worker role This is a custom instrumentation example for a Worker role. It creates a custom transaction named ProcessMessage. The transaction begins when the ProcessMessage method is entered, and it ends when the method returns. The following example uses MyWorkerRole as the namespace. If you do not specify a name, it will default to the Solution name. namespace MyWorkerRole { public class NotificationQueue { public bool ProcessMessage(Message message) { // code to process message } } } Copy Here is the custom instrumentation file for the code: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-extension\"> <instrumentation> <tracerfactory name=\"NewRelic.Agent.Core.Tracer.Factories.BackgroundThreadTracerFactory\" metricName=\"Custom/ProcessMessage\"> <match assemblyname=\"MyWorkerRole\" classname=\"MyWorkerRole.NotificationQueue\"> <exactmethodmatcher methodName=\"ProcessMessage\" /> </match> </tracerfactory> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy On a local installation, place this instrumentation file in C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Extensions. Custom instrumentation file deployment Optional: To send the custom instrumentation file up with an Azure Cloud Service deployment: In your Azure Cloud project, add the instrumentation file to your Worker role inside the Roles folder. After installing the New Relic .NET agent NuGet package, locate newrelic.cmd in your Worker Role project. Find the statement IF %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 within the :INSTALL_NEWRELIC_AGENT block, and add the following statement to the conditional: IF %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 ( copy /Y \"%RoleRoot%\\approot\\MyInstrumentation.xml\" \"%NR_HOME%\\extensions\" >> %RoleRoot%\\nr.log ) ELSE ( Copy In this example, the newrelic.cmd batch file copies the custom instrumentation file to the Extensions folder in D:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\, or %NR_HOME%. This example uses MyInstrumentation.xml, but any name will work as long as the file name and copy command match, and the file is valid XML. Optional: Create custom config file You can create a custom configuration file in Visual Studio. This allows you to make changes to newrelic.config inside Visual Studio, without having to remote into your Azure Role instance every time you make a change. Whenever you publish your app, the config file in Visual Studio is automatically uploaded to the remote host. The choices you make with the installation wizard do not matter. Installing locally does not affect your Azure development environment. In Visual Studio, select the Solution Explorer, then open NewRelicAgent_x64_XYZ.msi. Follow the steps to install the agent locally. Import newrelic.config into your project: In Solution Explorer > Cloud Project, right-click the Web Role, then select Add > Existing Item. Navigate to C: \\ ProgramData \\ New Relic \\ .NET Agent and select newrelic.config. From C: \\ ProgramData \\ New Relic \\ .NET Agent, edit newrelic.cmd. In the :INSTALL_NEWRELIC_AGENT section, find this statement: IF $ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 ( Copy Add the following code as another statement inside the IF block, then save the file: copy /Y \"%RoleRoot%\\approot\\newrelic.config\" \"%NR_HOME%\" >> %RoleRoot%\\nr.log Copy You can now edit the newrelic.config hosted in Visual Studio. Whenever you publish your app, the copy command will upload the config file to the remote host. View your app's performance Your application must receive traffic in order for you to view its performance in New Relic. You may need to wait a few minutes for data to start appearing. If no data appears, see the troubleshooting procedures for Azure Cloud Services. To view your app's performance in APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). The APM Summary page automatically appears. You can also view detailed information about errors, database and instance performance issues, and more. If you created your New Relic app prior to October 2017, you can use the Azure Portal to select the New Relic account blade. You will be automatically logged in with SAML Single Sign-on (SSO) to APM. You can also view your application's error rate and throughput data in the Azure Portal by going to New Relic Accounts > choose your application.",

      "body": "This document explains how to install New Relic's .NET agent for application performance monitoring on your Azure Web App. (This is not the same as installing the infrastructure monitoring integrations for Microsoft Azure.) Recommendation: Before following these instructions, read the .NET agent installation overview. Installation options Tip To use .NET or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use any of the following methods to add the New Relic .NET agent to your Azure-deployed web app. The best option depends on your role, environment, deployments, etc. For example: For operations teams that need to monitor the app, best practice may be to: Install using the Azure Site Extension For developer teams, best practice may be to use NuGet: Install using NuGet (.NET Framework) Install using NuGet (.NET Core) In order to monitor non-web apps (including WebJobs), or ASP.NET Core apps targeting .NET Framework, you must explicitly enable the agent for that application's .exe process via one of these two methods: Enable via placement of local newrelic.config file. Enable via application config file In addition, WebJobs may need custom instrumentation for transactions to appear in APM, and additional configuration if they run for less than one minute. Disable Application Insights Both New Relic's .NET agent and Microsoft Application Insights rely on the CLR Profiler, but only one may be active at a time. You must disable Application Insights in order for the .NET agent to function properly. For more information, see our Application Insights troubleshooting procedures. Install using the New Relic Azure Site Extension To install the .NET agent for an Azure Web App using the New Relic Azure Site Extension: Shut down your web application before installing the New Relic Azure Site Extension. Add the site extension: Navigate to http://[yoursitename].scm.azurewebsites.net, then select Site extensions > Gallery. Select the plus icon next to the New Relic site extension. In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app to use the new version of the agent. Install using NuGet (.NET Framework) The NuGet packages in this procedure support only the old packages.config. They do not support the current PackageReference format. For more information, see Microsoft's package reference documentation. For multi-project solutions, make sure you have selected the correct project (for example, a specific web app project) before installing the NuGet package. If you are upgrading the .NET Framework agent using NuGet, any changes you made in the newrelic.config will be overwritten. To preserve any changes, save your newrelic.config outside of your project, then restore it after upgrading. To install the .NET agent on an Azure Web App using NuGet: In the Azure portal, verify your Azure Platform (32-bit or 64-bit): From the Azure sidebar menu, select App Services > Your Application > Settings > Configuration > General settings. Open your application in Visual Studio, and install the New Relic NuGet package by running the appropriate command from the Package manager console: 32-bit: Install-Package NewRelic.Azure.WebSites 64-bit: Install-Package NewRelic.Azure.WebSites.x64 Publish your application. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Settings > Configuration. From Configuration, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Key Value COR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 COR_PROFILER {71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} COR_PROFILER_PATH D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll NEWRELIC_HOME D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app. Install using NuGet (.NET Core) New Relic .NET Core agent supports Linux and Windows applications on Azure App Services. The installation process for Azure App Services differs from the .NET Core agent installation procedures for Linux and Windows. To install the .NET agent on an Azure Web App using NuGet: Install the NewRelic.Agent NuGet package. Modify the log node by adding a directory attribute to your newrelic.config file: Log file configuration for Windows log directory=\"D:\\Home\\LogFiles\\NewRelic\" level=\"info\"/log Copy Log file configuration for Linux log directory=\"/home/LogFiles/NewRelic\" level=\"info\"/log Copy Publish your application. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Settings > Configuration. From Configuration, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Environment variables for Windows Key Value CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 CORECLR_PROFILER {36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH_32 D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\x86\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH_64 D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic Environment variables for Linux Key Value CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 CORECLR_PROFILER {36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH /home/site/wwwroot/newrelic/libNewRelicProfiler.so CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME /home/site/wwwroot/newrelic In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app. Add New Relic app settings to Azure App Services To add your app settings: Make sure you have your license key before adding the New Relic .NET agent's app settings. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Configuration > Application settings. From Application settings, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Key Value NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY YOUR_LICENSE_KEY NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME YOUR_APP_NAME Save and restart your web app. Setting the license key and app name with Application settings will override the newrelic.config. To verify your app's environment variables in your app's Kudu diagnostic console, go to Environment > Environment variables. For example: https://myappname.scm.azurewebsites.net/Env.cshtml#envVariables Copy View your app's performance Your application must receive traffic in order for you to view its performance in New Relic. You may need to wait a few minutes for data to start appearing. If no data appears, see the troubleshooting procedures for Azure Web Apps. To view your app's performance in New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). The APM Summary page automatically appears.

You can also view your application's error rate and throughput data in the Azure portal by going to New Relic Accounts > (select your app). Troubleshooting If no data appears after installing the agent, generating traffic for your app, and waiting a few minutes, try these troubleshooting tips: Make sure that all files in the newrelic directory at the root of your app got published to Azure. Make sure the environment variables are set correctly. Make sure Microsoft Application Insights is not installed and configured on the application. For more information, see the Application Insights troubleshooting procedures. Refer to additional Azure troubleshooting procedures as applicable.",

Follow the steps to install the agent locally. Import newrelic.config into your project: In Solution Explorer > Cloud Project, right-click the Web Role, then select Add > Existing Item. Navigate to C: \\ ProgramData \\ New Relic \\ .NET Agent and select newrelic.config. From C: \\ ProgramData \\ New Relic \\ .NET Agent, edit newrelic.cmd. In the :INSTALL_NEWRELIC_AGENT section, find this statement: IF $ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 ( Copy Add the following code as another statement inside the IF block, then save the file: copy /Y \"%RoleRoot%\\approot\\newrelic.config\" \"%NR_HOME%\" >> %RoleRoot%\\nr.log Copy You can now edit the newrelic.config hosted in Visual Studio. Whenever you publish your app, the copy command will upload the config file to the remote host. View your app's performance Your application must receive traffic in order for you to view its performance in New Relic. You may need to wait a few minutes for data to start appearing. If no data appears, see the troubleshooting procedures for Azure Cloud Services. To view your app's performance in APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). The APM Summary page automatically appears. You can also view detailed information about errors, database and instance performance issues, and more. If you created your New Relic app prior to October 2017, you can use the Azure Portal to select the New Relic account blade. You will be automatically logged in with SAML Single Sign-on (SSO) to APM.

      "body": "This document explains how to install APM's .NET Framework agent and .NET Core agent on Azure Service Fabric. This is not the same as installing the Infrastructure integrations for Microsoft Azure. Install .NET agent on Azure Service Fabric Important In most cases, installing the .NET agent in an Azure Service Fabric environment can be performed using the standard install procedures for either Windows or Linux. This document highlights some alternate ways you can install the agent. You will need to ensure the agent gets installed on all nodes in your cluster. To monitor multiple nodes, you may want to integrate the install into your deployment process. If you are using containers in your Service Fabric environment you should read Install for Docker. You can also install the agent in a Service Fabric environment using NuGet. NuGet is often a good option for developers because the agent gets deployed along with your application. Though, using NuGet requires some manual installation procedures. See Install with NuGet. Install using NuGet To install the .NET agent using NuGet: Follow the standard NuGet install procedures. When using NuGet, you must set some environment variables. This can be done in your application's ServiceManifest.xml file. See the relevant instructions below: .NET Framework In the ServiceManifest.xml file in your project, include the following under the CodePackage node: <CodePackage Name=\"Code\" Version=\"1.0.0\"> </CodePackage> <CodePackage> ... <EntryPoint> <ExeHost> ... <!-- It is important for the WorkingFolder to be set to CodePackage --> <!-- This is because the environment variables set below rely on this being the working folder for the agent to work --> <WorkingFolder>CodePackage</WorkingFolder> ... </ExeHost> </EntryPoint> ... <EnvironmentVariables> ... <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"COR_ENABLE_PROFILING\" Value=\"1\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"COR_PROFILER\" Value=\"{71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41}\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"COR_PROFILER_PATH\" Value=\".\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEWRELIC_HOME\" Value=\".\\newrelic\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Value=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME\" Value=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" /> ... </EnvironmentVariables> ... </CodePackage> Copy .NET Core for Windows In the ServiceManifest.xml file in your project, include the following under the CodePackage node: <CodePackage> ... <EntryPoint> <ExeHost> ... <!-- It is important for the WorkingFolder to be set to CodePackage --> <!-- This is because the environment variables set below rely on this being the working folder for the agent to work --> <WorkingFolder>CodePackage</WorkingFolder> ... </ExeHost> </EntryPoint> ... <EnvironmentVariables> ... <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING\" Value=\"1\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_PROFILER\" Value=\"{36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A}\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH\" Value=\".\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME\" Value=\".\\newrelic\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Value=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME\" Value=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" /> ... </EnvironmentVariables> ... </CodePackage> Copy .NET Core for Linux In the ServiceManifest.xml file in your project, include the following under the CodePackage node: <CodePackage> ... <EntryPoint> <ExeHost> ... <!-- It is important for the WorkingFolder to be set to CodePackage --> <!-- This is because the environment variables set below rely on this being the working folder for the agent to work --> <WorkingFolder>CodePackage</WorkingFolder> ... </ExeHost> </EntryPoint> ... <EnvironmentVariables> ... <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING\" Value=\"1\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_PROFILER\" Value=\"{36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A}\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH\" Value=\"./newrelic/libNewRelicProfiler.so\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME\" Value=\"./newrelic\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Value=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME\" Value=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" /> ... </EnvironmentVariables> ... </CodePackage> Copy For the .NET Framework only: Edit your app.config file and add the NewRelic.AgentEnabled app setting: <appSettings> ... <add key=\"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"true\" /> ... </appSettings> Copy If your application is generating traffic, data should appear in your APM account in several minutes.

If you'd like to use Always On, simply update the agent. If your application targets .NET Framework 4.0 or lower, Always On will still interfere with the agent and the workarounds below are still applicable. Problem You installed New Relic's .NET agent through Microsoft Azure Web Apps and are using Azure's Always On setting. After generating some traffic and waiting a few minutes for data collection to start for your app, data still does not appear in the APM user interface. Cause If no data appears within five minutes, Azure's Always On setting may be conflicting with New Relic. This feature is only available in Azure's Basic and Standard modes. The Always On setting prevents the environment variable APP_POOL_ID from being set. New Relic's .NET agent needs this environment variable to get the app name. If the agent cannot determine an application name, then it won't start up. Solution If you are using Microsoft's Standard or Basic tiers with the Azure Portal, ensure that the Always On setting is disabled. In the Azure Portal, select (your app) > Settings > Application Settings. Set the Always On toggle to Off. Other options Here are some other options you can try. If these do not work, you must turn off the Always On setting. Use Kudu to name your app. To name your application in the local newrelic.config using Kudu: From the Microsoft Azure Portal, select (your app) > Tools > Kudu, then select Go. Select Debug Console > CMD. Select Site > wwwroot > newrelic. Select the edit icon for newrelic.config, and add: <application> <name> Your app's name </name> </application> Copy Save and restart your application. Use app/web.config to name your app. Important This option has been found to only be a temporary fix. The .NET agent may stop reporting intermittently. To name your application in its app/web.config file: Add the following key to appSettings: <appSettings> <add key=\"NewRelic.AppName\" value=\"Your app's name\" /> </appSettings> Copy Restart your instance. Use Synthetic monitoring to monitor your website. Depending on your usage of Always On, you can try using Synthetic monitoring to keep your website active. If you are not using the Always On setting, you can try using the Synthetic monitoring free pinger monitor. If you are using the Always On setting, Synthetic monitoring needs to be able to reach an endpoint for your worker roles. If it can't, you can try using a Synthetics scripted monitor to run on your site.",

After generating some traffic and waiting a few minutes for data collection to start for your app, data still does not appear in the APM user interface. Cause If no data appears within five minutes, Azure's Always On setting may be conflicting with New Relic. This feature is only available in Azure's Basic and Standard modes. The Always On setting prevents the environment variable APP_POOL_ID from being set. New Relic's .NET agent needs this environment variable to get the app name. If the agent cannot determine an application name, then it won't start up. Solution If you are using Microsoft's Standard or Basic tiers with the Azure Portal, ensure that the Always On setting is disabled. In the Azure Portal, select (your app) > Settings > Application Settings. Set the Always On toggle to Off. Other options Here are some other options you can try. If these do not work, you must turn off the Always On setting. Use Kudu to name your app. To name your application in the local newrelic.config using Kudu: From the Microsoft Azure Portal, select (your app) > Tools > Kudu, then select Go. Select Debug Console > CMD. Select Site > wwwroot > newrelic. Select the edit icon for newrelic.config, and add: <application> <name> Your app's name </name> </application> Copy Save and restart your application. Use app/web.config to name your app. Important This option has been found to only be a temporary fix. The .NET agent may stop reporting intermittently. To name your application in its app/web.config file: Add the following key to appSettings: <appSettings> <add key=\"NewRelic.AppName\" value=\"Your app's name\" /> </appSettings> Copy Restart your instance. Use Synthetic monitoring to monitor your website. Depending on your usage of Always On, you can try using Synthetic monitoring to keep your website active. If you are not using the Always On setting, you can try using the Synthetic monitoring free pinger monitor. If you are using the Always On setting, Synthetic monitoring needs to be able to reach an endpoint for your worker roles. If it can't, you can try using a Synthetics scripted monitor to run on your site.",
