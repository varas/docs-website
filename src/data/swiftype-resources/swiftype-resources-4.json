Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "With our Go agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. Here we explain how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and give an example of deploying a Go app with Docker. Important The Go agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the Go agent, building a custom Go runtime for Docker, and deploying a golang application. For more information about deploying and configuring your Go app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Go Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Go app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Go agent for your specific app server, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Go to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, download and install git, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. The following Dockerfile example code defines the golang version used. FROM golang:1.8-onbuild CMD go run main.go Copy 4. Build a Docker image To build the Docker image, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build --rm -t Docker-image-name . Copy 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project go-app-name app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see GAE's documentation for debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Go agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.yml file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy",

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing New Relic for PHP applications. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Important As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP if that version is PHP 5.1, which is deprecated. If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only found a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. Important If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-nnnn.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install-daemon mode Important Requires PHP agent 9.2 or higher. To install the daemon without the agent, run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This may be useful if the daemon is running on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application (as may happen with agent install on containers). Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in APM, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters that might have been placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. Tip To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling (RedHat and CentOS) or Uninstalling (Ubuntu and Debian).

Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data.

This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values.

To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing New Relic for PHP applications. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Important As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP if that version is PHP 5.1, which is deprecated. If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only found a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. Important If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-nnnn.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install-daemon mode Important Requires PHP agent 9.2 or higher. To install the daemon without the agent, run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This may be useful if the daemon is running on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application (as may happen with agent install on containers). Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in APM, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters that might have been placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. Tip To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling (RedHat and CentOS) or Uninstalling (Ubuntu and Debian).

With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

This also includes a summary of the PHP agent properties that have been deprecated with the release of New Relic agent attributes. Properties Use the following destination properties to open or close the destination to any attribute collection: newrelic.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes in all destinations. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: False Turns on or turns off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data that gets sent to page views in Insights. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to browser monitoring regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for traced errors. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for Span data. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to spans regardless of how this property is set. Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude properties to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: newrelic.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic. newrelic.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic Browser in page views. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.span_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in span events. newrelic.span_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection.

With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level.

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic UI. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change automatically applies to all New Relic APM agents, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings not available from the UI. Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly within the New Relic UI, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you utilize environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings. Go hierarchy Java hierarchy .NET hierarchy Node.js hierarchy PHP hierarchy (server-side configuration not supported) Python hierarchy Ruby hierarchy Enable server-side configuration Tip Owner, Admins, or Add-on Managers The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration.

View or change server-side configuration settings Tip Owner, Admins, or Add-on Managers If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector. The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file. Disable server-side configuration Once you enable server-side configuration for an account, server-side configuration cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support.

      "body": "Our PHP agent has a number of settings to fine-tune the types and amounts of data reported. For most users, the default values produce the best possible mix of overhead and utility. However, you can change the settings for your specific needs. Important Always restart your web server after changing INI settings. Otherwise, they may not take effect immediately. Configuration order of precedence Here is a simple illustration of the order of precedence that the PHP agent follows for configuration. Server-side configuration is not applicable. The only values you can change in the UI for apps using the PHP agent are the app's alias and its Apdex-T value. With New Relic's PHP agent, API settings override per-directory configuration settings. Per-directory settings override the php.ini file settings. Server-side configuration is not applicable. Configuration file variables During installation, the newrelic-install script provides information about the configuration files it created or a list of files you need to edit. By default it will attempt to create a configuration file named newrelic.ini. In some cases, you may be instructed to add configuration options to your php.ini file. Only do this if necessary. Exactly which file you need to edit depends on how your particular version (or versions) of PHP were configured. The two most common configurations are: Use a single newrelic.ini file. This is usually the default if you have installed or compiled PHP yourself with no special options. Scan a given directory for all .ini files. If you are unsure which file to edit: From the command line, review the output of php -i. In a browser, review the output of a page containing the script: <?php phpinfo(); ?> Copy If the newrelic.ini file appears, use it. Variable scope Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined scope. The scope controls where the setting can be established or modified. The two scopes supported for New Relic settings are: SYSTEM: Values set globally in the global newrelic.ini file. PERDIR: Values set on a per-directory basis. Each can also be set at a more general level. Valid locations for each are: Can be set for: SYSTEM PERDIR Set in the global newrelic.ini file. Set on a per-directory basis. Important You cannot use ini_set() for New Relic settings. Variable type Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined type. The type specifies the syntax for the value you use. Variable type Formatting and contents String String values can contain any alphanumeric character and punctuation. The value is delimited by quotes. Boolean A logical true or false setting. Valid values are: For true or enabled: on, true, the number 1. For false or disabled: off, false, the number 0. Number Numeric values can only contain digits, plus a period to indicate floats. Unless otherwise stated, all numbers are integers, not floats. Duration A string value delimited by quotes that represent a time duration. Use character flags to delimit time components. If there are no flags, the time is in milliseconds. w\\ = weeks d\\ = days h\\ = hours m\\ = minutes s\\ = seconds ms\\ = milliseconds us\\ = microseconds Example durations: \"1w3d23h10m\"\\ = 1 week, 3 days, 23 hours, and 10 minutes \"5h30m\"\\ = 5 hours and 30 minutes \"500\"\\ = 500 milliseconds General configuration settings These settings are available in the newrelic.ini file. newrelic.appname (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"PHP Application\" This config option sets the application name that data is reported under in APM. We highly recommends that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in New Relic, so set this carefully. For all application-naming options, including per-directory settings, see Name your PHP application. The setting's value is a semicolon-separated list of up to three application names. The first name in the list is the primary application name. It must be unique for each account. The application name is used as a key into a cache. When using multiple names for an app, New Relic only uses the first name for caching. Therefore, each application name can only appear as the first element once. Caching example If you set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App2\" and later in the code set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App3\", the second one will appear not to work. It will report to App1 and App2 because of the caching. If you need overlapping application names, set the common application name in the second or third positions. For example: newrelic.appname=\"App2;App1\" and newrelic.appname=\"App3;App1\". This is useful, for example, when you want to track a superset of applications. newrelic.capture_params Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. To set this value programmatically, use the newrelic_capture_params() API function. If you pass sensitive information directly in the URL, keep this disabled. If set to true, this will enable the recording of parameters passed to a PHP script via the URL (everything after the ? in the URL) in transaction traces. These will appear under the Parameters dropdown when displaying transaction traces. newrelic.framework Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: (auto-detected) The New Relic PHP agent automatically detects the frameworks it supports, but problems may arise if you are using experimental new versions or if you have customized the framework. This setting disables automatic framework detection, instead telling the agent to attempt to name transactions according to the specified framework. Specifying \"no_framework\" will disable framework-related transaction naming entirely. Use any of the following values, as appropriate: \"cakephp\" \"codeigniter\" \"drupal\" (for Drupal 6 and 7) \"drupal8\" \"joomla\" \"kohana\" \"laravel\" \"magento\" \"magento2\" \"mediawiki\" \"silex\" \"symfony1\" \"symfony2\" (for Symfony 2 and 3) \"symfony4\" \"wordpress\" \"yii\" \"zend\" \"zend2\" (for Zend Framework 2 and 3) \"no_framework\" (to force no framework even if one was detected) If the framework auto-detection fails, this command will also fail. newrelic.ignored_params Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. Use the newrelic.ignored_params setting to specify a comma-separated list of parameter names to be excluded from the list of parameters sent to the New Relic servers. Enclose the string values with quote marks. If you enable parameter capturing with newrelic.capture_params, there may be parameters with sensitive user data you do not want to be captured by New Relic or visible in transaction traces. Use this to block the recording of this data. newrelic.license (REQUIRED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Notes: Introduced in agent version 3.0. Sets the New Relic license key to use. In a multi-tenant system this can be set on a per-directory basis. Tip When you upgrade from an old agent version to 3.0 or higher, the license will be removed from your daemon configuration file (with a comment explaining why) and stored in the file /etc/newrelic/upgrade_please.key. Copy the license out of that file and set it in your newrelic.ini file. Delete the upgrade_please.key file. newrelic.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the level of detail of messages sent to the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, include: error warning info verbose debug verbosedebug When reporting any agent issues to New Relic technical support, verbosedebug is the most useful setting. However, this can generate a lot of information very quickly, so avoid keeping the agent at verbosedebug level for longer than it takes to reproduce the problem you are experiencing. When reporting any agent issues to New Relic Technical Support, you may be asked to set this to a custom level, enabling debugging only for certain subsystems. Custom levels are beyond the scope of this document. newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 1 Notes: This used to be newrelic.transaction_tracer.top100. Sets the level of detail in a transaction trace: When set to 1, all server calls are traced. When set to 0, traces only include internally instrumented calls by New Relic and those defined by the user using newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom. The default level of 1 does have a performance impact. If you need to improve performance, try setting the detail level to 0. When not tracing all server calls, blocks of time in transaction traces will be labeled as uninstrumented time, and only certain functions (defined internally by the agent) are instrumented. Even when reporting all calls, there may be uninstrumented time in the traces. newrelic.high_security Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables high security for all applications. When high security is set to true, the following behaviors take effect: Data will not be sent to New Relic unless the newrelic-daemon is using a secure connection (HTTPS). If the PHP process spawns a newrelic-daemon, it will be configured to use HTTPS regardless of the value of newrelic.daemon.ssl. Raw query strings will never be gathered, regardless of the value of newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql. Request attributes will never be captured, regardless of the newrelic.attributes configuration settings. The newrelic_add_custom_parameter and newrelic_set_user_attributes API function will have no effect, and they will return false. The newrelic_record_custom_event API function will not submit any events to New Relic. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Caution If you change the newrelic.high_security setting, you must also change the security setting in the APM user interface. If the two settings do not match, then no data will be collected. For more information, see High security. newrelic.labels Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Adds tags. Example tags \"Server:One;Data Center:Primary\" Copy newrelic.process_host.display_name Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. Daemon .ini settings The values of these settings control the daemon startup. When the agent detects that the daemon needs to be started, it will convert these options into the appropriate command line options for the daemon. All of these settings mirror the settings in the newrelic.cfg file. They are repeated here to keep all of the .ini settings in one place. Each setting in newrelic.cfg has its counterpart here, with newrelic.daemon. as the prefix. For example, the ssl setting in newrelic.cfg is newrelic.daemon.ssl in an .ini file. Important If the file /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent ignores these settings, and the agent will not start the daemon automatically. For more information about ways to start the daemon and when to use an external configuration file, see PHP daemon startup modes. newrelic.daemon.app_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"5m\" or \"1h20m\" Default: \"10m\" Sets the elapsed time after which an application will be considered inactive. Inactive applications do not count against the maximum limit of 250 applications. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". A value of 0 will be interpreted as \"no timeout.\" This will result in new applications always counting towards the 250 application limit, as well as the daemon being unable to release a small amount of memory per application back to the operating system. Recommendation: Do not use this value unless New Relic Support requests it. Instead, for occasional background transactions, use a value of twice the interval. For example, for an hourly background job, set the timeout to 2 hours. newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon connecting an application. A value of 0 causes the agent to only make one attempt at connecting to the daemon. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". With this timeout set, the agent will not immediately drop a transaction when the daemon hasn't connected to the backend yet, but rather grant the daemon time to establish the connection. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 15s. Only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of connection problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. newrelic.daemon.auditlog Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" The setting specifies the name of an audit log, which will contain all of the data sent from the daemon to the New Relic servers, including the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, unencoded data for each request. This file cannot be the same file as the daemon log. Important This audit log can become very large, very quickly. Avoid using the newrelic.daemon.auditlog setting for extended periods of time. Its primary purpose is to allow system administrators to perform security reviews and to observe exactly what data transmits. newrelic.daemon.collector_host Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"collector.newrelic.com\" Sets the name and optional port of the collector host which the daemon will contact to verify your license key and send agent data. This is either just the name of the host or the name and port number in the form \"hostname:port\". Specifying a port number of 0 will use the default port, which is 80. Caution Do not change this value without guidance from New Relic Support. newrelic.daemon.dont_launch Scope: SYSTEM Type: Number Default: 0 If you prefer to have the daemon launched externally before the agent starts up, this value determines when the agent is allowed to start the daemon: 0: No restrictions are placed on daemon startup and the agent can start the daemon any time. 1: Non-command line (such as Apache or php-fpm) agents can start the daemon. 2: Only command line agents can start the daemon. 3: The agent will never start the daemon. Use this setting if you are configuring the daemon via newrelic.cfg and starting it outside of the agent. Important If /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent assumes the daemon is meant to be started by its startup script, not via the agent. This setting has no meaning to and does not appear in newrelic.cfg. newrelic.daemon.location Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/usr/bin/newrelic-daemon\" Sets the name of the daemon executable to launch. This variable identifies the full path to the daemon executable file. If the New Relic system was installed using the standard packages, the default location will be correct. If you have installed to a custom location using the tar distribution (and do not have permission to write to /usr/bin), then the daemon may reside at another location. This setting does not appear in the newrelic.cfg file as it is only relevant to PHP. Important On OpenSolaris, /usr is frequently a read-only file system. The default daemon location for OpenSolaris is /opt/newrelic/bin/newrelic-daemon. newrelic.daemon.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log\" Sets the name of the log file to record daemon specific log messages. This file must be writable by the daemon. The most common case is that the Apache user will end up starting the daemon when Apache itself starts up, thus you should ensure that the file is writable by whichever user runs the Apache process. Caution If the daemon log file is not writable, the daemon will not start automatically, which will prevent data from reporting. You can use write permissions to this file as a means of restricting who can start the daemon. newrelic.daemon.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the detail level for messages recorded to New Relic's daemon log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: error warning info debug The more verbose settings can generate a lot of information very quickly. When necessary, set debug for short periods of time to identify problems. newrelic.daemon.pidfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: (depends on OS) Sets the name of the file in which the daemon will record its process ID (pid). This file is used by the daemon startup and shutdown script to determine whether or not the daemon is already running. newrelic.daemon.address (alias for newrelic.daemon.port) Scope: SYSTEM Type: String or Number Default: \"@newrelic\" on Linux, \"/tmp/.newrelic.sock\" otherwise Tip From v9.2.0.247, the PHP agent supports a new setting, newrelic.daemon.address,which serves as an alias to newrelic.daemon.port. You can use either to specify the location of the New Relic PHP daemon. If both values are set, newrelic.daemon.address takes precedence. Sets the socket endpoint for agent to daemon communications. This can be specified in four ways. To use a specified file as a UNIX domain socket (UDS), provide an absolute path name as a string. This is the default on non-Linux systems. To use a standard TCP port, specify a number in the range 1 to 65534. To use an abstract socket, use the value @newrelic-daemon (available for agent version 5.2.0.141 or higher). This is the default on Linux systems. To connect to a daemon that is running on a different host (helpful for container environments), set this value to host:port, where host denotes either a host name or an IP, and port denotes a valid port number. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is available for agent version 9.2.0.247 or higher. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon (this only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts). If you use port numbers, Unix systems require that ports in the range 1 to 1023 require the daemon be run as the super-user. In case the daemon uses a non-standard port, this variable also sets the port number the agent will use for communicating with the daemon. Important If you're using the newrelic.cfg startup mechanism for the daemon, this setting and the address setting in that file must match. newrelic.daemon.proxy Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the host and user credentials to use as an egress proxy. This is only used if your site requires a proxy in order to access the New Relic data collection servers. It can take any of the following forms, depending on the proxy setup: hostname hostname:port user@hostname user@hostname:port user:password@hostname user:password@hostname:port proxytype://user:password@hostname:port A proxy type of HTTP is assumed unless another proxytype is specified. In that case, proxytype can be one of http, socks4, socks4a, or socks5. newrelic.daemon.ssl Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true This setting is ignored on PHP agent versions 8.0 and higher, and HTTPS will always be used to communicate with New Relic. On versions of the PHP agent versions lower than 8.0, controls whether or not communication with New Relic collectors should use a secure HTTP connection. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA bundle. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path is also set, the certificates in this file will be searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA path. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle is also set, it will be searched first followed by the certificates contained in newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.start_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon to start after a daemon launch was triggered. A value of 0 causes the agent to not wait. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\" and \"h\". The specified timeout value will be passed to the daemon via the --wait-for-port flag. This causes daemon startup to block until a socket is acquired or until the timeout is elapsed. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 2s to 5s. It is recommended to only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of daemon start problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. Transaction tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Set this to a comma-separated list of user defined functions or methods to instrument: \"myfunction,myclass::method,otherfunction\" Copy Internal PHP functions cannot have custom tracing. You can add to the list of custom functions with each PERDIR file, but you cannot remove a function or method that has already been added. If you want to programmatically add functions or methods to be instrumented, use the newrelic_add_custom_tracer() API function call. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables the transaction tracer. The tracer creates a detailed transaction trace for transactions that take more time than the threshold, as set by the newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold value. Only one transaction trace per application per harvest cycle is stored and it is always the slowest transaction during that cycle. Transaction traces are useful for diagnosing why a particular transaction was slow. Unless memory and performance are critical, they should almost never be disabled. Enabling this does have a very slight performance impact and does use more memory. For more information, see newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables requesting explain plans from MySQLi and PDO MySQL libraries for slow query calls. Explain plans will only be available when newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql is set to true and newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is not set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" Sets the threshold beyond which queries are considered \"slow\" and thus candidates for the Slow Queries page. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.internal_functions_enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables or disables support for tracing internal functions (that is, functions written in C and provided either via the PHP standard library or PECL extensions). When enabled, internal functions appear in transaction traces like functions written in PHP. Enabling this option may result in transactions being slower, especially when collecting many traces from PHP 5.x. Enabling this option is only recommended when specifically debugging performance issues where an internal function is suspected to be slow. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"obfuscated\" Sets how queries are recorded (if at all). When recording transaction traces internally, the full query for slow query calls is recorded. Sending this query to New Relic can have serious security implications, so by default, all database statements are obfuscated before being sent to New Relic. The obfuscation is not reversible, as it replaces strings and numbers in any query with question marks. The only things that survive intact are field names, not any of their values. If you are testing with data that is not sensitive and you need to see the raw queries in transaction traces, set this to \"raw\". If you do not want queries recorded at all, set this to \"off\". Important Always set this back to \"obfuscated\" or \"off\" in any production environment. newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable the Slow Queries feature. When enabled, it will: Record the top 10 slowest database queries per application per minute. Create a stack trace leading up to the query. If this variable is set to false or SQL recording is disabled, the New Relic agent does not gather any slow query data. newrelic.transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" This sets the threshold above which the agent will record the full PHP stack for transaction traces for which queries are being recorded. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" Stack traces can consume memory, so be careful of setting this value too low. This variable has no meaning if newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"apdex_f\" Use this variable to set the threshold beyond which transactions are eligible for being traced. Available values include: Use \"apdex_f\" to set the threshold to 4 times the application's apdex_t value. For more information, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. Use any other duration string to set a specific time threshold. Specify the duration as an absolute value and the unit of measurement. If none is specified, the unit defaults to millisecond. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.gather_input_queries Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable gathering of DQL input queries with Slow Queries and Transaction Traces. When enabled, these will appear along with slow queries and transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 0 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for web transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP web processes; it will not effect PHP CLI processes. To set a limit for CLI processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 100000 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for CLI transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP CLI processes; it will not effect PHP web processes. To set a limit for web processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web. Other tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control various tracer features. newrelic.cross_application_tracer.enabled Important A distributed tracing feature is available. Distributed tracing improves on cross application tracing and is recommended for monitoring activity in complex distributed systems. Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the cross application tracer. The cross application tracer inserts HTTP headers into outbound requests and the response in order to link together web transaction metrics and transaction traces between applications. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the PHP agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross-application tracing. Before enabling, read the transition guide to understand effects on New Relic features. Enable or disable distributed tracing. When the agent's transaction tracer and distributed tracing features are enabled, the agent will insert headers into outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic distributed tracing header that is attached to outbound requests, and to instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are attached to outbound requests. The New Relic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that do not support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over New Relic headers for distributed tracing. newrelic.span_events_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Span event reporting requires distributed tracing to be enabled. This option enables/disables the reporting of span events. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: \"\" Configures the Trace Observer used for Infinite Tracing. If empty, Infinite Tracing support will be disabled. This requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer Default: 443 Configures the TCP/IP port used to communicate with the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. This setting is ignored if newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host is empty. This setting will not usually need to be changed. newrelic.infinite_tracing.span_events.queue_size Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer (1000 or higher) Default: 100000 Sets the number of span events that can be queued for transmission to the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. The agent internally manages span events for Infinite Tracing in span batches. Those span batches can hold a maximum of 1000 spans. Therefore, the span events queue size cannot be lower than 1000, as otherwise not even a single span batch can be queued. If a queue size lower than 1000 is specified, the minimum size of 1000 is used. newrelic.error_collector.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the error collector. When enabled, the agent collects and reports PHP errors to the New Relic UI. The agent records only the single most severe error for each transaction, and up to 20 errors per harvest cycle. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. newrelic.error_collector.record_database_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When enabled, the agent collects errors returned by MySQL functions as if they were PHP errors. newrelic.error_collector.prioritize_api_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to assign the highest priority to errors identified through the newrelic_notice_error() API function. newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) A comma separated list of fully-qualified exception class names that the agent should ignore. When an unhandled exception occurs, the agent will perform the equivalent of $exception instanceof Class for each of the classes listed. If any of those checks returns true, the agent will not record an exception. Depending on the supported PHP release, these values are equivalent to disabling exception reporting: Supported PHP 5 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Exceptions Supported PHP 7 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Throwable newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer or a bitwise expression of PHP-defined error constants Default: 0 Sets the error levels for the PHP agent to ignore. The value for this setting uses similar syntax to PHP's error_reporting option. For example, to configure the PHP agent to ignore E_WARNING and E_ERROR level errors, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_WARNING | E_ERROR or newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = 3 To configure the PHP agent to ignore everything but E_WARNING, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_ALL & ~E_WARNING newrelic.framework.drupal.modules Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: In agents prior to version 3.0 the default for this value was false. Setting this option implied newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail = 1. To enable Drupal module tracking, set this to true. This option has the same performance impact as newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. It will enable the recording of Drupal module functions and call counts, and they will display under the Modules tab, much like web transactions. newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true To enable WordPress hook tracking, set this to true. It will enable the recording of WordPress hooks, plugins, and themes, and they will display under the WordPress tab in the New Relic UI. newrelic.webtransaction.name.files Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" This is the same as newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions, except it uses file names to name the web transaction. The file names can be standard POSIX regular expression to be used with PCRE; for example, \"controllers/actions/.*\". newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Unless the New Relic agent detects a specific framework, such as Drupal or Wordpress, web transactions are named after the initial PHP file; for example, article.php. When the initial file is a dispatcher, this naming scheme produces less than useful data. Use this variable to specify a list of functions that are the \"actions\" generated by the dispatcher. The name of the web transaction will be the first action function executed. Example dispatch function naming If index.php dispatches to functions named: login, logout, admin, show, and edit You would set this value to \"login,logout,admin,show,edit\". The web transactions will be named login, logout, etc. instead of /index.php (the initial file name). newrelic.webtransaction.name.remove_trailing_path Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false When enabled,this removes any content in the request URI after the script name. For example, this would remove the trailing /xyz/zy from /path/to/foo.php/xyz/zy. newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow sql traces. newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. Attribute settings This section lists the settings that affect attribute collection and reporting. newrelic.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the collection of attributes generated by the PHP agent or generated by the user through newrelic_add_custom_parameter(). This setting will take precedence over all other attribute configuration settings. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: True, except for browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Control which destinations receive attributes. These configuration settings will override the .include and .exclude settings. For more information on the destinations available, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.attributes.{include|exclude} Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) This is a family of configuration options that allow fine control over the destinations of attributes. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. Other .ini settings This section lists the remaining newrelic.ini settings. newrelic.enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: (none) Enable or disable the New Relic agent. By default the New Relic PHP agent is enabled for all directories. If you have multiple sites on your web server but only want the PHP agent to monitor specific ones: Make sure newrelic.enabled is set to true at the global (SYSTEM) level in your newrelic.ini file. Set newrelic.enabled to false for one or more specific sites on a per-directory basis (PERDIR). If you need to disable the agent globally, set the newrelic.enabled value to false in the newrelic.ini file. When the agent is globally disabled, it does not initialize completely. It assumes you are globally disabling it for a critical reason, and the agent will attempt to have as close to zero impact on PHP as possible. Important You cannot globally disable the agent and then selectively enable it on a per-directory basis by using .htaccess. newrelic.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/php_agent.log\" This identifies the file name for logging messages. This is useful for debugging any issues with the agent. Whatever you set this to, ensure that: The permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. The user that PHP runs as can write to the file. Usually this is the same user as the web server. newrelic.transaction_events.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report analytics event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. newrelic.error_collector.capture_events Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report error event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show Error analytics. newrelic.feature_flag Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This setting enables new and experimental features within the PHP agent. These flags are used to selectively enable features that are intended to be enabled by default in later versions of the PHP agent. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This enables auto-insertion of the JavaScript fragments for browser monitoring. When enabled will cause the agent to insert a header and a footer in HTML output that will generate metrics on page load timing for the end-user experience. For more information, see Page load timing in PHP. newrelic.guzzle.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables support for the Guzzle library when used with New Relic. PHP agent version 6.4 or higher: This setting is set to true by default. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: Introduced in PHP agent version 9.4 Enables the detection of frameworks and libraries when preloading is enabled. Preloading was introduced in PHP version 7.4. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection will only take effect when opcache.preload is set in the php.ini file.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic UI. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change automatically applies to all New Relic APM agents, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings not available from the UI. Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly within the New Relic UI, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you utilize environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls.

      "body": "The daemon (newrelic-daemon) acts as a proxy between the PHP agent and the New Relic collector to reduce network traffic and to improve response time for instrumented applications. The daemon process starts when your system starts, and must be running for data to be sent to New Relic. Recommended configuration Beginning with version 3.0 of the PHP agent, the daemon can be automatically configured and started by the agent. Auto-configuration does not require the newrelic.cfg file. This is the recommended configuration. However, there are still some cases where manually starting the daemon is useful. For more information about the startup process, see New Relic daemon startup modes. Manual configuration A sample daemon configuration file was created during installation. To manually configure the daemon, copy and rename newrelic.cfg.template from /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg.template to /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg and edit the file. All settings are optional and most have default values. Important The agent will not automatically start the daemon if it finds a newrelic.cfg file in the /etc/newrelic/ directory. logfile Default: [none] Sets the name of the log file to use. Can be set on the command line by the daemon -l option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg Although the daemon itself provides no default name for the log file, the daemon startup scripts use the -l option to set the default location and name to /var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log. loglevel Default: info Sets the level of detail for messages sent to the log file. This field has the same possible values as the agent, which are, in increasing order of detail: error warning info debug If you are encountering problems with the daemon, set the log level debug for at least long enough to reproduce the problem. A debug log file is often necessary to debug issues with the proxy daemon. Can be set on the command line using the daemon --loglevel option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg ssl Default: yes This configuration setting is only available in PHP agent versions lower than 8.0. Versions 8.0 and higher will ignore this setting and always use HTTPS encryption to communicate with New Relic. When set to yes, the proxy will only use a secure connection to communicate with the collector. While the setting specifies SSL, the setting refers to HTTPS encryption to the latest industry standards. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to New Relic and the New Relic REST API. Can be enabled or disabled on the command line by the daemon --tls option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg ssl_ca_bundle Default: \"\" Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA bundle. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If ssl_ca_path is also set (see below), the certificates in this file will be searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when ssl is set to false. ssl_ca_path Default: \"\" Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA path. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If ssl_ca_bundle is also set (see above), it will be searched first followed by the certificates contained in ssl_ca_path. This setting has no effect when ssl is set to false. proxy Default: [none] Certain sites have very restrictive egress firewalls and require you to use a proxy in order to communicate with the outside world. If this applies to your site, you will need to set this value. The value is in the form scheme://user:password@hostname:port. The values scheme, user, password, and port may be omitted depending on your proxy configuration. For example, if you are using a HTTP proxy that does not require a user name and password, you could just use hostname:port. The port defaults to 1080 for most proxies. Can be set on the command line using the daemon --proxy option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg address (alias for port) Default: /tmp/.newrelic.sock Sets the socket endpoint the daemon will listen on. This endpoint allows agents to communicate with the daemon. This must be the same value as the agent's newrelic.daemon.address setting. This can be specified in these ways: Recommended. To use a specified file as a UNIX domain socket (UDS), provide an absolute path name as a string. To use a standard TCP port, specify a number in the range 1 to 65534. To use an abstract socket, use the value @newrelic-daemon (available for agent version 5.2.0.141 or higher). To enable connections from applications that are running on different hosts (helpful for container environments), set this value to host:port, where host denotes the host name or IP address of the local host, and port denotes a valid port number. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is available for PHP agent version 9.2.0.247 or higher. These options may also be set via the command line using the daemon --address option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg. pidfile Default: /tmp/newrelic.pid Sets the name of the file in which the daemon will record its process ID (pid). Although the daemon sets this to a default value of /tmp/newrelic.pid, the startup script almost always uses the --pidfile option to set it to /var/run/newrelic-daemon.pid. Can be set on the command line using the daemon --pidfile option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg auditlog Default: [none] This feature was introduced in version 3.4. When enabled, the agent will create an audit log, which contains all of the data sent from the daemon to New Relic. This data includes the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, un-encoded data for each request. This allows you to observe exactly what data is sent to New Relic in order to ensure no sensitive data is included. The file specified can not be the same file as the daemon log, as described above. This audit log can become very large very quickly, so New Relic recommends that you do not use it for extended periods of time. Can be set on the command line using the daemon --auditlog option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic UI. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change automatically applies to all New Relic APM agents, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings not available from the UI. Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly within the New Relic UI, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you utilize environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings.

      "body": "Our PHP agent has a number of settings to fine-tune the types and amounts of data reported. For most users, the default values produce the best possible mix of overhead and utility. However, you can change the settings for your specific needs. Important Always restart your web server after changing INI settings. Otherwise, they may not take effect immediately. Configuration order of precedence Here is a simple illustration of the order of precedence that the PHP agent follows for configuration. Server-side configuration is not applicable. The only values you can change in the UI for apps using the PHP agent are the app's alias and its Apdex-T value. With New Relic's PHP agent, API settings override per-directory configuration settings. Per-directory settings override the php.ini file settings. Server-side configuration is not applicable. Configuration file variables During installation, the newrelic-install script provides information about the configuration files it created or a list of files you need to edit. By default it will attempt to create a configuration file named newrelic.ini. In some cases, you may be instructed to add configuration options to your php.ini file. Only do this if necessary. Exactly which file you need to edit depends on how your particular version (or versions) of PHP were configured. The two most common configurations are: Use a single newrelic.ini file. This is usually the default if you have installed or compiled PHP yourself with no special options. Scan a given directory for all .ini files. If you are unsure which file to edit: From the command line, review the output of php -i. In a browser, review the output of a page containing the script: <?php phpinfo(); ?> Copy If the newrelic.ini file appears, use it. Variable scope Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined scope. The scope controls where the setting can be established or modified. The two scopes supported for New Relic settings are: SYSTEM: Values set globally in the global newrelic.ini file. PERDIR: Values set on a per-directory basis. Each can also be set at a more general level. Valid locations for each are: Can be set for: SYSTEM PERDIR Set in the global newrelic.ini file. Set on a per-directory basis. Important You cannot use ini_set() for New Relic settings. Variable type Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined type. The type specifies the syntax for the value you use. Variable type Formatting and contents String String values can contain any alphanumeric character and punctuation. The value is delimited by quotes. Boolean A logical true or false setting. Valid values are: For true or enabled: on, true, the number 1. For false or disabled: off, false, the number 0. Number Numeric values can only contain digits, plus a period to indicate floats. Unless otherwise stated, all numbers are integers, not floats. Duration A string value delimited by quotes that represent a time duration. Use character flags to delimit time components. If there are no flags, the time is in milliseconds. w\\ = weeks d\\ = days h\\ = hours m\\ = minutes s\\ = seconds ms\\ = milliseconds us\\ = microseconds Example durations: \"1w3d23h10m\"\\ = 1 week, 3 days, 23 hours, and 10 minutes \"5h30m\"\\ = 5 hours and 30 minutes \"500\"\\ = 500 milliseconds General configuration settings These settings are available in the newrelic.ini file. newrelic.appname (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"PHP Application\" This config option sets the application name that data is reported under in APM. We highly recommends that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in New Relic, so set this carefully. For all application-naming options, including per-directory settings, see Name your PHP application. The setting's value is a semicolon-separated list of up to three application names. The first name in the list is the primary application name. It must be unique for each account. The application name is used as a key into a cache. When using multiple names for an app, New Relic only uses the first name for caching. Therefore, each application name can only appear as the first element once. Caching example If you set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App2\" and later in the code set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App3\", the second one will appear not to work. It will report to App1 and App2 because of the caching. If you need overlapping application names, set the common application name in the second or third positions. For example: newrelic.appname=\"App2;App1\" and newrelic.appname=\"App3;App1\". This is useful, for example, when you want to track a superset of applications. newrelic.capture_params Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. To set this value programmatically, use the newrelic_capture_params() API function. If you pass sensitive information directly in the URL, keep this disabled. If set to true, this will enable the recording of parameters passed to a PHP script via the URL (everything after the ? in the URL) in transaction traces. These will appear under the Parameters dropdown when displaying transaction traces. newrelic.framework Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: (auto-detected) The New Relic PHP agent automatically detects the frameworks it supports, but problems may arise if you are using experimental new versions or if you have customized the framework. This setting disables automatic framework detection, instead telling the agent to attempt to name transactions according to the specified framework. Specifying \"no_framework\" will disable framework-related transaction naming entirely. Use any of the following values, as appropriate: \"cakephp\" \"codeigniter\" \"drupal\" (for Drupal 6 and 7) \"drupal8\" \"joomla\" \"kohana\" \"laravel\" \"magento\" \"magento2\" \"mediawiki\" \"silex\" \"symfony1\" \"symfony2\" (for Symfony 2 and 3) \"symfony4\" \"wordpress\" \"yii\" \"zend\" \"zend2\" (for Zend Framework 2 and 3) \"no_framework\" (to force no framework even if one was detected) If the framework auto-detection fails, this command will also fail. newrelic.ignored_params Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. Use the newrelic.ignored_params setting to specify a comma-separated list of parameter names to be excluded from the list of parameters sent to the New Relic servers. Enclose the string values with quote marks. If you enable parameter capturing with newrelic.capture_params, there may be parameters with sensitive user data you do not want to be captured by New Relic or visible in transaction traces. Use this to block the recording of this data. newrelic.license (REQUIRED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Notes: Introduced in agent version 3.0. Sets the New Relic license key to use. In a multi-tenant system this can be set on a per-directory basis. Tip When you upgrade from an old agent version to 3.0 or higher, the license will be removed from your daemon configuration file (with a comment explaining why) and stored in the file /etc/newrelic/upgrade_please.key. Copy the license out of that file and set it in your newrelic.ini file. Delete the upgrade_please.key file. newrelic.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the level of detail of messages sent to the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, include: error warning info verbose debug verbosedebug When reporting any agent issues to New Relic technical support, verbosedebug is the most useful setting. However, this can generate a lot of information very quickly, so avoid keeping the agent at verbosedebug level for longer than it takes to reproduce the problem you are experiencing. When reporting any agent issues to New Relic Technical Support, you may be asked to set this to a custom level, enabling debugging only for certain subsystems. Custom levels are beyond the scope of this document. newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 1 Notes: This used to be newrelic.transaction_tracer.top100. Sets the level of detail in a transaction trace: When set to 1, all server calls are traced. When set to 0, traces only include internally instrumented calls by New Relic and those defined by the user using newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom. The default level of 1 does have a performance impact. If you need to improve performance, try setting the detail level to 0. When not tracing all server calls, blocks of time in transaction traces will be labeled as uninstrumented time, and only certain functions (defined internally by the agent) are instrumented. Even when reporting all calls, there may be uninstrumented time in the traces. newrelic.high_security Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables high security for all applications. When high security is set to true, the following behaviors take effect: Data will not be sent to New Relic unless the newrelic-daemon is using a secure connection (HTTPS). If the PHP process spawns a newrelic-daemon, it will be configured to use HTTPS regardless of the value of newrelic.daemon.ssl. Raw query strings will never be gathered, regardless of the value of newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql. Request attributes will never be captured, regardless of the newrelic.attributes configuration settings. The newrelic_add_custom_parameter and newrelic_set_user_attributes API function will have no effect, and they will return false. The newrelic_record_custom_event API function will not submit any events to New Relic. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Caution If you change the newrelic.high_security setting, you must also change the security setting in the APM user interface. If the two settings do not match, then no data will be collected. For more information, see High security. newrelic.labels Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Adds tags. Example tags \"Server:One;Data Center:Primary\" Copy newrelic.process_host.display_name Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. Daemon .ini settings The values of these settings control the daemon startup. When the agent detects that the daemon needs to be started, it will convert these options into the appropriate command line options for the daemon. All of these settings mirror the settings in the newrelic.cfg file. They are repeated here to keep all of the .ini settings in one place. Each setting in newrelic.cfg has its counterpart here, with newrelic.daemon. as the prefix. For example, the ssl setting in newrelic.cfg is newrelic.daemon.ssl in an .ini file. Important If the file /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent ignores these settings, and the agent will not start the daemon automatically. For more information about ways to start the daemon and when to use an external configuration file, see PHP daemon startup modes. newrelic.daemon.app_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"5m\" or \"1h20m\" Default: \"10m\" Sets the elapsed time after which an application will be considered inactive. Inactive applications do not count against the maximum limit of 250 applications. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". A value of 0 will be interpreted as \"no timeout.\" This will result in new applications always counting towards the 250 application limit, as well as the daemon being unable to release a small amount of memory per application back to the operating system. Recommendation: Do not use this value unless New Relic Support requests it. Instead, for occasional background transactions, use a value of twice the interval. For example, for an hourly background job, set the timeout to 2 hours. newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon connecting an application. A value of 0 causes the agent to only make one attempt at connecting to the daemon. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". With this timeout set, the agent will not immediately drop a transaction when the daemon hasn't connected to the backend yet, but rather grant the daemon time to establish the connection. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 15s. Only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of connection problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. newrelic.daemon.auditlog Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" The setting specifies the name of an audit log, which will contain all of the data sent from the daemon to the New Relic servers, including the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, unencoded data for each request. This file cannot be the same file as the daemon log. Important This audit log can become very large, very quickly. Avoid using the newrelic.daemon.auditlog setting for extended periods of time. Its primary purpose is to allow system administrators to perform security reviews and to observe exactly what data transmits. newrelic.daemon.collector_host Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"collector.newrelic.com\" Sets the name and optional port of the collector host which the daemon will contact to verify your license key and send agent data. This is either just the name of the host or the name and port number in the form \"hostname:port\". Specifying a port number of 0 will use the default port, which is 80. Caution Do not change this value without guidance from New Relic Support. newrelic.daemon.dont_launch Scope: SYSTEM Type: Number Default: 0 If you prefer to have the daemon launched externally before the agent starts up, this value determines when the agent is allowed to start the daemon: 0: No restrictions are placed on daemon startup and the agent can start the daemon any time. 1: Non-command line (such as Apache or php-fpm) agents can start the daemon. 2: Only command line agents can start the daemon. 3: The agent will never start the daemon. Use this setting if you are configuring the daemon via newrelic.cfg and starting it outside of the agent. Important If /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent assumes the daemon is meant to be started by its startup script, not via the agent. This setting has no meaning to and does not appear in newrelic.cfg. newrelic.daemon.location Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/usr/bin/newrelic-daemon\" Sets the name of the daemon executable to launch. This variable identifies the full path to the daemon executable file. If the New Relic system was installed using the standard packages, the default location will be correct. If you have installed to a custom location using the tar distribution (and do not have permission to write to /usr/bin), then the daemon may reside at another location. This setting does not appear in the newrelic.cfg file as it is only relevant to PHP. Important On OpenSolaris, /usr is frequently a read-only file system. The default daemon location for OpenSolaris is /opt/newrelic/bin/newrelic-daemon. newrelic.daemon.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log\" Sets the name of the log file to record daemon specific log messages. This file must be writable by the daemon. The most common case is that the Apache user will end up starting the daemon when Apache itself starts up, thus you should ensure that the file is writable by whichever user runs the Apache process. Caution If the daemon log file is not writable, the daemon will not start automatically, which will prevent data from reporting. You can use write permissions to this file as a means of restricting who can start the daemon. newrelic.daemon.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the detail level for messages recorded to New Relic's daemon log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: error warning info debug The more verbose settings can generate a lot of information very quickly. When necessary, set debug for short periods of time to identify problems. newrelic.daemon.pidfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: (depends on OS) Sets the name of the file in which the daemon will record its process ID (pid). This file is used by the daemon startup and shutdown script to determine whether or not the daemon is already running. newrelic.daemon.address (alias for newrelic.daemon.port) Scope: SYSTEM Type: String or Number Default: \"@newrelic\" on Linux, \"/tmp/.newrelic.sock\" otherwise Tip From v9.2.0.247, the PHP agent supports a new setting, newrelic.daemon.address,which serves as an alias to newrelic.daemon.port. You can use either to specify the location of the New Relic PHP daemon. If both values are set, newrelic.daemon.address takes precedence. Sets the socket endpoint for agent to daemon communications. This can be specified in four ways. To use a specified file as a UNIX domain socket (UDS), provide an absolute path name as a string. This is the default on non-Linux systems. To use a standard TCP port, specify a number in the range 1 to 65534. To use an abstract socket, use the value @newrelic-daemon (available for agent version 5.2.0.141 or higher). This is the default on Linux systems. To connect to a daemon that is running on a different host (helpful for container environments), set this value to host:port, where host denotes either a host name or an IP, and port denotes a valid port number. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is available for agent version 9.2.0.247 or higher. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon (this only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts). If you use port numbers, Unix systems require that ports in the range 1 to 1023 require the daemon be run as the super-user. In case the daemon uses a non-standard port, this variable also sets the port number the agent will use for communicating with the daemon. Important If you're using the newrelic.cfg startup mechanism for the daemon, this setting and the address setting in that file must match. newrelic.daemon.proxy Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the host and user credentials to use as an egress proxy. This is only used if your site requires a proxy in order to access the New Relic data collection servers. It can take any of the following forms, depending on the proxy setup: hostname hostname:port user@hostname user@hostname:port user:password@hostname user:password@hostname:port proxytype://user:password@hostname:port A proxy type of HTTP is assumed unless another proxytype is specified. In that case, proxytype can be one of http, socks4, socks4a, or socks5. newrelic.daemon.ssl Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true This setting is ignored on PHP agent versions 8.0 and higher, and HTTPS will always be used to communicate with New Relic. On versions of the PHP agent versions lower than 8.0, controls whether or not communication with New Relic collectors should use a secure HTTP connection. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA bundle. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path is also set, the certificates in this file will be searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA path. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle is also set, it will be searched first followed by the certificates contained in newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.start_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon to start after a daemon launch was triggered. A value of 0 causes the agent to not wait. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\" and \"h\". The specified timeout value will be passed to the daemon via the --wait-for-port flag. This causes daemon startup to block until a socket is acquired or until the timeout is elapsed. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 2s to 5s. It is recommended to only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of daemon start problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. Transaction tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Set this to a comma-separated list of user defined functions or methods to instrument: \"myfunction,myclass::method,otherfunction\" Copy Internal PHP functions cannot have custom tracing. You can add to the list of custom functions with each PERDIR file, but you cannot remove a function or method that has already been added. If you want to programmatically add functions or methods to be instrumented, use the newrelic_add_custom_tracer() API function call. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables the transaction tracer. The tracer creates a detailed transaction trace for transactions that take more time than the threshold, as set by the newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold value. Only one transaction trace per application per harvest cycle is stored and it is always the slowest transaction during that cycle. Transaction traces are useful for diagnosing why a particular transaction was slow. Unless memory and performance are critical, they should almost never be disabled. Enabling this does have a very slight performance impact and does use more memory. For more information, see newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables requesting explain plans from MySQLi and PDO MySQL libraries for slow query calls. Explain plans will only be available when newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql is set to true and newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is not set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" Sets the threshold beyond which queries are considered \"slow\" and thus candidates for the Slow Queries page. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.internal_functions_enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables or disables support for tracing internal functions (that is, functions written in C and provided either via the PHP standard library or PECL extensions). When enabled, internal functions appear in transaction traces like functions written in PHP. Enabling this option may result in transactions being slower, especially when collecting many traces from PHP 5.x. Enabling this option is only recommended when specifically debugging performance issues where an internal function is suspected to be slow. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"obfuscated\" Sets how queries are recorded (if at all). When recording transaction traces internally, the full query for slow query calls is recorded. Sending this query to New Relic can have serious security implications, so by default, all database statements are obfuscated before being sent to New Relic. The obfuscation is not reversible, as it replaces strings and numbers in any query with question marks. The only things that survive intact are field names, not any of their values. If you are testing with data that is not sensitive and you need to see the raw queries in transaction traces, set this to \"raw\". If you do not want queries recorded at all, set this to \"off\". Important Always set this back to \"obfuscated\" or \"off\" in any production environment. newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable the Slow Queries feature. When enabled, it will: Record the top 10 slowest database queries per application per minute. Create a stack trace leading up to the query. If this variable is set to false or SQL recording is disabled, the New Relic agent does not gather any slow query data. newrelic.transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" This sets the threshold above which the agent will record the full PHP stack for transaction traces for which queries are being recorded. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" Stack traces can consume memory, so be careful of setting this value too low. This variable has no meaning if newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"apdex_f\" Use this variable to set the threshold beyond which transactions are eligible for being traced. Available values include: Use \"apdex_f\" to set the threshold to 4 times the application's apdex_t value. For more information, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. Use any other duration string to set a specific time threshold. Specify the duration as an absolute value and the unit of measurement. If none is specified, the unit defaults to millisecond. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.gather_input_queries Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable gathering of DQL input queries with Slow Queries and Transaction Traces. When enabled, these will appear along with slow queries and transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 0 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for web transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP web processes; it will not effect PHP CLI processes. To set a limit for CLI processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 100000 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for CLI transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP CLI processes; it will not effect PHP web processes. To set a limit for web processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web. Other tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control various tracer features. newrelic.cross_application_tracer.enabled Important A distributed tracing feature is available. Distributed tracing improves on cross application tracing and is recommended for monitoring activity in complex distributed systems. Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the cross application tracer. The cross application tracer inserts HTTP headers into outbound requests and the response in order to link together web transaction metrics and transaction traces between applications. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the PHP agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross-application tracing. Before enabling, read the transition guide to understand effects on New Relic features. Enable or disable distributed tracing. When the agent's transaction tracer and distributed tracing features are enabled, the agent will insert headers into outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic distributed tracing header that is attached to outbound requests, and to instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are attached to outbound requests. The New Relic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that do not support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over New Relic headers for distributed tracing. newrelic.span_events_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Span event reporting requires distributed tracing to be enabled. This option enables/disables the reporting of span events. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: \"\" Configures the Trace Observer used for Infinite Tracing. If empty, Infinite Tracing support will be disabled. This requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer Default: 443 Configures the TCP/IP port used to communicate with the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. This setting is ignored if newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host is empty. This setting will not usually need to be changed. newrelic.infinite_tracing.span_events.queue_size Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer (1000 or higher) Default: 100000 Sets the number of span events that can be queued for transmission to the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. The agent internally manages span events for Infinite Tracing in span batches. Those span batches can hold a maximum of 1000 spans. Therefore, the span events queue size cannot be lower than 1000, as otherwise not even a single span batch can be queued. If a queue size lower than 1000 is specified, the minimum size of 1000 is used. newrelic.error_collector.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the error collector. When enabled, the agent collects and reports PHP errors to the New Relic UI. The agent records only the single most severe error for each transaction, and up to 20 errors per harvest cycle. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. newrelic.error_collector.record_database_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When enabled, the agent collects errors returned by MySQL functions as if they were PHP errors. newrelic.error_collector.prioritize_api_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to assign the highest priority to errors identified through the newrelic_notice_error() API function. newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) A comma separated list of fully-qualified exception class names that the agent should ignore. When an unhandled exception occurs, the agent will perform the equivalent of $exception instanceof Class for each of the classes listed. If any of those checks returns true, the agent will not record an exception. Depending on the supported PHP release, these values are equivalent to disabling exception reporting: Supported PHP 5 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Exceptions Supported PHP 7 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Throwable newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer or a bitwise expression of PHP-defined error constants Default: 0 Sets the error levels for the PHP agent to ignore. The value for this setting uses similar syntax to PHP's error_reporting option. For example, to configure the PHP agent to ignore E_WARNING and E_ERROR level errors, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_WARNING | E_ERROR or newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = 3 To configure the PHP agent to ignore everything but E_WARNING, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_ALL & ~E_WARNING newrelic.framework.drupal.modules Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: In agents prior to version 3.0 the default for this value was false. Setting this option implied newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail = 1. To enable Drupal module tracking, set this to true. This option has the same performance impact as newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. It will enable the recording of Drupal module functions and call counts, and they will display under the Modules tab, much like web transactions. newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true To enable WordPress hook tracking, set this to true. It will enable the recording of WordPress hooks, plugins, and themes, and they will display under the WordPress tab in the New Relic UI. newrelic.webtransaction.name.files Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" This is the same as newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions, except it uses file names to name the web transaction. The file names can be standard POSIX regular expression to be used with PCRE; for example, \"controllers/actions/.*\". newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Unless the New Relic agent detects a specific framework, such as Drupal or Wordpress, web transactions are named after the initial PHP file; for example, article.php. When the initial file is a dispatcher, this naming scheme produces less than useful data. Use this variable to specify a list of functions that are the \"actions\" generated by the dispatcher. The name of the web transaction will be the first action function executed. Example dispatch function naming If index.php dispatches to functions named: login, logout, admin, show, and edit You would set this value to \"login,logout,admin,show,edit\". The web transactions will be named login, logout, etc. instead of /index.php (the initial file name). newrelic.webtransaction.name.remove_trailing_path Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false When enabled,this removes any content in the request URI after the script name. For example, this would remove the trailing /xyz/zy from /path/to/foo.php/xyz/zy. newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow sql traces. newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. Attribute settings This section lists the settings that affect attribute collection and reporting. newrelic.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the collection of attributes generated by the PHP agent or generated by the user through newrelic_add_custom_parameter(). This setting will take precedence over all other attribute configuration settings. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: True, except for browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Control which destinations receive attributes. These configuration settings will override the .include and .exclude settings. For more information on the destinations available, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.attributes.{include|exclude} Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) This is a family of configuration options that allow fine control over the destinations of attributes. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. Other .ini settings This section lists the remaining newrelic.ini settings. newrelic.enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: (none) Enable or disable the New Relic agent. By default the New Relic PHP agent is enabled for all directories. If you have multiple sites on your web server but only want the PHP agent to monitor specific ones: Make sure newrelic.enabled is set to true at the global (SYSTEM) level in your newrelic.ini file. Set newrelic.enabled to false for one or more specific sites on a per-directory basis (PERDIR). If you need to disable the agent globally, set the newrelic.enabled value to false in the newrelic.ini file. When the agent is globally disabled, it does not initialize completely. It assumes you are globally disabling it for a critical reason, and the agent will attempt to have as close to zero impact on PHP as possible. Important You cannot globally disable the agent and then selectively enable it on a per-directory basis by using .htaccess. newrelic.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/php_agent.log\" This identifies the file name for logging messages. This is useful for debugging any issues with the agent. Whatever you set this to, ensure that: The permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. The user that PHP runs as can write to the file. Usually this is the same user as the web server. newrelic.transaction_events.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report analytics event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. newrelic.error_collector.capture_events Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report error event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show Error analytics. newrelic.feature_flag Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This setting enables new and experimental features within the PHP agent. These flags are used to selectively enable features that are intended to be enabled by default in later versions of the PHP agent. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This enables auto-insertion of the JavaScript fragments for browser monitoring. When enabled will cause the agent to insert a header and a footer in HTML output that will generate metrics on page load timing for the end-user experience. For more information, see Page load timing in PHP. newrelic.guzzle.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables support for the Guzzle library when used with New Relic. PHP agent version 6.4 or higher: This setting is set to true by default. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: Introduced in PHP agent version 9.4 Enables the detection of frameworks and libraries when preloading is enabled. Preloading was introduced in PHP version 7.4. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection will only take effect when opcache.preload is set in the php.ini file.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Server-side configuration transitions some core settings from your language agent's configuration file to the New Relic collector. Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic UI. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change automatically applies to all New Relic APM agents, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings not available from the UI. Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly within the New Relic UI, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you utilize environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings.

      "body": "Our PHP agent has a number of settings to fine-tune the types and amounts of data reported. For most users, the default values produce the best possible mix of overhead and utility. However, you can change the settings for your specific needs. Important Always restart your web server after changing INI settings. Otherwise, they may not take effect immediately. Configuration order of precedence Here is a simple illustration of the order of precedence that the PHP agent follows for configuration. Server-side configuration is not applicable. The only values you can change in the UI for apps using the PHP agent are the app's alias and its Apdex-T value. With New Relic's PHP agent, API settings override per-directory configuration settings. Per-directory settings override the php.ini file settings. Server-side configuration is not applicable. Configuration file variables During installation, the newrelic-install script provides information about the configuration files it created or a list of files you need to edit. By default it will attempt to create a configuration file named newrelic.ini. In some cases, you may be instructed to add configuration options to your php.ini file. Only do this if necessary. Exactly which file you need to edit depends on how your particular version (or versions) of PHP were configured. The two most common configurations are: Use a single newrelic.ini file. This is usually the default if you have installed or compiled PHP yourself with no special options. Scan a given directory for all .ini files. If you are unsure which file to edit: From the command line, review the output of php -i. In a browser, review the output of a page containing the script: <?php phpinfo(); ?> Copy If the newrelic.ini file appears, use it. Variable scope Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined scope. The scope controls where the setting can be established or modified. The two scopes supported for New Relic settings are: SYSTEM: Values set globally in the global newrelic.ini file. PERDIR: Values set on a per-directory basis. Each can also be set at a more general level. Valid locations for each are: Can be set for: SYSTEM PERDIR Set in the global newrelic.ini file. Set on a per-directory basis. Important You cannot use ini_set() for New Relic settings. Variable type Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined type. The type specifies the syntax for the value you use. Variable type Formatting and contents String String values can contain any alphanumeric character and punctuation. The value is delimited by quotes. Boolean A logical true or false setting. Valid values are: For true or enabled: on, true, the number 1. For false or disabled: off, false, the number 0. Number Numeric values can only contain digits, plus a period to indicate floats. Unless otherwise stated, all numbers are integers, not floats. Duration A string value delimited by quotes that represent a time duration. Use character flags to delimit time components. If there are no flags, the time is in milliseconds. w\\ = weeks d\\ = days h\\ = hours m\\ = minutes s\\ = seconds ms\\ = milliseconds us\\ = microseconds Example durations: \"1w3d23h10m\"\\ = 1 week, 3 days, 23 hours, and 10 minutes \"5h30m\"\\ = 5 hours and 30 minutes \"500\"\\ = 500 milliseconds General configuration settings These settings are available in the newrelic.ini file. newrelic.appname (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"PHP Application\" This config option sets the application name that data is reported under in APM. We highly recommends that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in New Relic, so set this carefully. For all application-naming options, including per-directory settings, see Name your PHP application. The setting's value is a semicolon-separated list of up to three application names. The first name in the list is the primary application name. It must be unique for each account. The application name is used as a key into a cache. When using multiple names for an app, New Relic only uses the first name for caching. Therefore, each application name can only appear as the first element once. Caching example If you set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App2\" and later in the code set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App3\", the second one will appear not to work. It will report to App1 and App2 because of the caching. If you need overlapping application names, set the common application name in the second or third positions. For example: newrelic.appname=\"App2;App1\" and newrelic.appname=\"App3;App1\". This is useful, for example, when you want to track a superset of applications. newrelic.capture_params Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. To set this value programmatically, use the newrelic_capture_params() API function. If you pass sensitive information directly in the URL, keep this disabled. If set to true, this will enable the recording of parameters passed to a PHP script via the URL (everything after the ? in the URL) in transaction traces. These will appear under the Parameters dropdown when displaying transaction traces. newrelic.framework Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: (auto-detected) The New Relic PHP agent automatically detects the frameworks it supports, but problems may arise if you are using experimental new versions or if you have customized the framework. This setting disables automatic framework detection, instead telling the agent to attempt to name transactions according to the specified framework. Specifying \"no_framework\" will disable framework-related transaction naming entirely. Use any of the following values, as appropriate: \"cakephp\" \"codeigniter\" \"drupal\" (for Drupal 6 and 7) \"drupal8\" \"joomla\" \"kohana\" \"laravel\" \"magento\" \"magento2\" \"mediawiki\" \"silex\" \"symfony1\" \"symfony2\" (for Symfony 2 and 3) \"symfony4\" \"wordpress\" \"yii\" \"zend\" \"zend2\" (for Zend Framework 2 and 3) \"no_framework\" (to force no framework even if one was detected) If the framework auto-detection fails, this command will also fail. newrelic.ignored_params Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. Use the newrelic.ignored_params setting to specify a comma-separated list of parameter names to be excluded from the list of parameters sent to the New Relic servers. Enclose the string values with quote marks. If you enable parameter capturing with newrelic.capture_params, there may be parameters with sensitive user data you do not want to be captured by New Relic or visible in transaction traces. Use this to block the recording of this data. newrelic.license (REQUIRED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Notes: Introduced in agent version 3.0. Sets the New Relic license key to use. In a multi-tenant system this can be set on a per-directory basis. Tip When you upgrade from an old agent version to 3.0 or higher, the license will be removed from your daemon configuration file (with a comment explaining why) and stored in the file /etc/newrelic/upgrade_please.key. Copy the license out of that file and set it in your newrelic.ini file. Delete the upgrade_please.key file. newrelic.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the level of detail of messages sent to the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, include: error warning info verbose debug verbosedebug When reporting any agent issues to New Relic technical support, verbosedebug is the most useful setting. However, this can generate a lot of information very quickly, so avoid keeping the agent at verbosedebug level for longer than it takes to reproduce the problem you are experiencing. When reporting any agent issues to New Relic Technical Support, you may be asked to set this to a custom level, enabling debugging only for certain subsystems. Custom levels are beyond the scope of this document. newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 1 Notes: This used to be newrelic.transaction_tracer.top100. Sets the level of detail in a transaction trace: When set to 1, all server calls are traced. When set to 0, traces only include internally instrumented calls by New Relic and those defined by the user using newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom. The default level of 1 does have a performance impact. If you need to improve performance, try setting the detail level to 0. When not tracing all server calls, blocks of time in transaction traces will be labeled as uninstrumented time, and only certain functions (defined internally by the agent) are instrumented. Even when reporting all calls, there may be uninstrumented time in the traces. newrelic.high_security Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables high security for all applications. When high security is set to true, the following behaviors take effect: Data will not be sent to New Relic unless the newrelic-daemon is using a secure connection (HTTPS). If the PHP process spawns a newrelic-daemon, it will be configured to use HTTPS regardless of the value of newrelic.daemon.ssl. Raw query strings will never be gathered, regardless of the value of newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql. Request attributes will never be captured, regardless of the newrelic.attributes configuration settings. The newrelic_add_custom_parameter and newrelic_set_user_attributes API function will have no effect, and they will return false. The newrelic_record_custom_event API function will not submit any events to New Relic. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Caution If you change the newrelic.high_security setting, you must also change the security setting in the APM user interface. If the two settings do not match, then no data will be collected. For more information, see High security. newrelic.labels Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Adds tags. Example tags \"Server:One;Data Center:Primary\" Copy newrelic.process_host.display_name Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. Daemon .ini settings The values of these settings control the daemon startup. When the agent detects that the daemon needs to be started, it will convert these options into the appropriate command line options for the daemon. All of these settings mirror the settings in the newrelic.cfg file. They are repeated here to keep all of the .ini settings in one place. Each setting in newrelic.cfg has its counterpart here, with newrelic.daemon. as the prefix. For example, the ssl setting in newrelic.cfg is newrelic.daemon.ssl in an .ini file. Important If the file /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent ignores these settings, and the agent will not start the daemon automatically. For more information about ways to start the daemon and when to use an external configuration file, see PHP daemon startup modes. newrelic.daemon.app_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"5m\" or \"1h20m\" Default: \"10m\" Sets the elapsed time after which an application will be considered inactive. Inactive applications do not count against the maximum limit of 250 applications. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". A value of 0 will be interpreted as \"no timeout.\" This will result in new applications always counting towards the 250 application limit, as well as the daemon being unable to release a small amount of memory per application back to the operating system. Recommendation: Do not use this value unless New Relic Support requests it. Instead, for occasional background transactions, use a value of twice the interval. For example, for an hourly background job, set the timeout to 2 hours. newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon connecting an application. A value of 0 causes the agent to only make one attempt at connecting to the daemon. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". With this timeout set, the agent will not immediately drop a transaction when the daemon hasn't connected to the backend yet, but rather grant the daemon time to establish the connection. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 15s. Only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of connection problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. newrelic.daemon.auditlog Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" The setting specifies the name of an audit log, which will contain all of the data sent from the daemon to the New Relic servers, including the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, unencoded data for each request. This file cannot be the same file as the daemon log. Important This audit log can become very large, very quickly. Avoid using the newrelic.daemon.auditlog setting for extended periods of time. Its primary purpose is to allow system administrators to perform security reviews and to observe exactly what data transmits. newrelic.daemon.collector_host Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"collector.newrelic.com\" Sets the name and optional port of the collector host which the daemon will contact to verify your license key and send agent data. This is either just the name of the host or the name and port number in the form \"hostname:port\". Specifying a port number of 0 will use the default port, which is 80. Caution Do not change this value without guidance from New Relic Support. newrelic.daemon.dont_launch Scope: SYSTEM Type: Number Default: 0 If you prefer to have the daemon launched externally before the agent starts up, this value determines when the agent is allowed to start the daemon: 0: No restrictions are placed on daemon startup and the agent can start the daemon any time. 1: Non-command line (such as Apache or php-fpm) agents can start the daemon. 2: Only command line agents can start the daemon. 3: The agent will never start the daemon. Use this setting if you are configuring the daemon via newrelic.cfg and starting it outside of the agent. Important If /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent assumes the daemon is meant to be started by its startup script, not via the agent. This setting has no meaning to and does not appear in newrelic.cfg. newrelic.daemon.location Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/usr/bin/newrelic-daemon\" Sets the name of the daemon executable to launch. This variable identifies the full path to the daemon executable file. If the New Relic system was installed using the standard packages, the default location will be correct. If you have installed to a custom location using the tar distribution (and do not have permission to write to /usr/bin), then the daemon may reside at another location. This setting does not appear in the newrelic.cfg file as it is only relevant to PHP. Important On OpenSolaris, /usr is frequently a read-only file system. The default daemon location for OpenSolaris is /opt/newrelic/bin/newrelic-daemon. newrelic.daemon.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log\" Sets the name of the log file to record daemon specific log messages. This file must be writable by the daemon. The most common case is that the Apache user will end up starting the daemon when Apache itself starts up, thus you should ensure that the file is writable by whichever user runs the Apache process. Caution If the daemon log file is not writable, the daemon will not start automatically, which will prevent data from reporting. You can use write permissions to this file as a means of restricting who can start the daemon. newrelic.daemon.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the detail level for messages recorded to New Relic's daemon log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: error warning info debug The more verbose settings can generate a lot of information very quickly. When necessary, set debug for short periods of time to identify problems. newrelic.daemon.pidfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: (depends on OS) Sets the name of the file in which the daemon will record its process ID (pid). This file is used by the daemon startup and shutdown script to determine whether or not the daemon is already running. newrelic.daemon.address (alias for newrelic.daemon.port) Scope: SYSTEM Type: String or Number Default: \"@newrelic\" on Linux, \"/tmp/.newrelic.sock\" otherwise Tip From v9.2.0.247, the PHP agent supports a new setting, newrelic.daemon.address,which serves as an alias to newrelic.daemon.port. You can use either to specify the location of the New Relic PHP daemon. If both values are set, newrelic.daemon.address takes precedence. Sets the socket endpoint for agent to daemon communications. This can be specified in four ways. To use a specified file as a UNIX domain socket (UDS), provide an absolute path name as a string. This is the default on non-Linux systems. To use a standard TCP port, specify a number in the range 1 to 65534. To use an abstract socket, use the value @newrelic-daemon (available for agent version 5.2.0.141 or higher). This is the default on Linux systems. To connect to a daemon that is running on a different host (helpful for container environments), set this value to host:port, where host denotes either a host name or an IP, and port denotes a valid port number. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is available for agent version 9.2.0.247 or higher. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon (this only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts). If you use port numbers, Unix systems require that ports in the range 1 to 1023 require the daemon be run as the super-user. In case the daemon uses a non-standard port, this variable also sets the port number the agent will use for communicating with the daemon. Important If you're using the newrelic.cfg startup mechanism for the daemon, this setting and the address setting in that file must match. newrelic.daemon.proxy Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the host and user credentials to use as an egress proxy. This is only used if your site requires a proxy in order to access the New Relic data collection servers. It can take any of the following forms, depending on the proxy setup: hostname hostname:port user@hostname user@hostname:port user:password@hostname user:password@hostname:port proxytype://user:password@hostname:port A proxy type of HTTP is assumed unless another proxytype is specified. In that case, proxytype can be one of http, socks4, socks4a, or socks5. newrelic.daemon.ssl Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true This setting is ignored on PHP agent versions 8.0 and higher, and HTTPS will always be used to communicate with New Relic. On versions of the PHP agent versions lower than 8.0, controls whether or not communication with New Relic collectors should use a secure HTTP connection. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA bundle. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path is also set, the certificates in this file will be searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA path. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle is also set, it will be searched first followed by the certificates contained in newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.start_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon to start after a daemon launch was triggered. A value of 0 causes the agent to not wait. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\" and \"h\". The specified timeout value will be passed to the daemon via the --wait-for-port flag. This causes daemon startup to block until a socket is acquired or until the timeout is elapsed. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 2s to 5s. It is recommended to only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of daemon start problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. Transaction tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Set this to a comma-separated list of user defined functions or methods to instrument: \"myfunction,myclass::method,otherfunction\" Copy Internal PHP functions cannot have custom tracing. You can add to the list of custom functions with each PERDIR file, but you cannot remove a function or method that has already been added. If you want to programmatically add functions or methods to be instrumented, use the newrelic_add_custom_tracer() API function call. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables the transaction tracer. The tracer creates a detailed transaction trace for transactions that take more time than the threshold, as set by the newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold value. Only one transaction trace per application per harvest cycle is stored and it is always the slowest transaction during that cycle. Transaction traces are useful for diagnosing why a particular transaction was slow. Unless memory and performance are critical, they should almost never be disabled. Enabling this does have a very slight performance impact and does use more memory. For more information, see newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables requesting explain plans from MySQLi and PDO MySQL libraries for slow query calls. Explain plans will only be available when newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql is set to true and newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is not set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" Sets the threshold beyond which queries are considered \"slow\" and thus candidates for the Slow Queries page. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.internal_functions_enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables or disables support for tracing internal functions (that is, functions written in C and provided either via the PHP standard library or PECL extensions). When enabled, internal functions appear in transaction traces like functions written in PHP. Enabling this option may result in transactions being slower, especially when collecting many traces from PHP 5.x. Enabling this option is only recommended when specifically debugging performance issues where an internal function is suspected to be slow. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"obfuscated\" Sets how queries are recorded (if at all). When recording transaction traces internally, the full query for slow query calls is recorded. Sending this query to New Relic can have serious security implications, so by default, all database statements are obfuscated before being sent to New Relic. The obfuscation is not reversible, as it replaces strings and numbers in any query with question marks. The only things that survive intact are field names, not any of their values. If you are testing with data that is not sensitive and you need to see the raw queries in transaction traces, set this to \"raw\". If you do not want queries recorded at all, set this to \"off\". Important Always set this back to \"obfuscated\" or \"off\" in any production environment. newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable the Slow Queries feature. When enabled, it will: Record the top 10 slowest database queries per application per minute. Create a stack trace leading up to the query. If this variable is set to false or SQL recording is disabled, the New Relic agent does not gather any slow query data. newrelic.transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" This sets the threshold above which the agent will record the full PHP stack for transaction traces for which queries are being recorded. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" Stack traces can consume memory, so be careful of setting this value too low. This variable has no meaning if newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"apdex_f\" Use this variable to set the threshold beyond which transactions are eligible for being traced. Available values include: Use \"apdex_f\" to set the threshold to 4 times the application's apdex_t value. For more information, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. Use any other duration string to set a specific time threshold. Specify the duration as an absolute value and the unit of measurement. If none is specified, the unit defaults to millisecond. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.gather_input_queries Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable gathering of DQL input queries with Slow Queries and Transaction Traces. When enabled, these will appear along with slow queries and transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 0 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for web transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP web processes; it will not effect PHP CLI processes. To set a limit for CLI processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 100000 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for CLI transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP CLI processes; it will not effect PHP web processes. To set a limit for web processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web. Other tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control various tracer features. newrelic.cross_application_tracer.enabled Important A distributed tracing feature is available. Distributed tracing improves on cross application tracing and is recommended for monitoring activity in complex distributed systems. Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the cross application tracer. The cross application tracer inserts HTTP headers into outbound requests and the response in order to link together web transaction metrics and transaction traces between applications. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the PHP agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross-application tracing. Before enabling, read the transition guide to understand effects on New Relic features. Enable or disable distributed tracing. When the agent's transaction tracer and distributed tracing features are enabled, the agent will insert headers into outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic distributed tracing header that is attached to outbound requests, and to instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are attached to outbound requests. The New Relic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that do not support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over New Relic headers for distributed tracing. newrelic.span_events_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Span event reporting requires distributed tracing to be enabled. This option enables/disables the reporting of span events. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: \"\" Configures the Trace Observer used for Infinite Tracing. If empty, Infinite Tracing support will be disabled. This requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer Default: 443 Configures the TCP/IP port used to communicate with the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. This setting is ignored if newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host is empty. This setting will not usually need to be changed. newrelic.infinite_tracing.span_events.queue_size Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer (1000 or higher) Default: 100000 Sets the number of span events that can be queued for transmission to the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. The agent internally manages span events for Infinite Tracing in span batches. Those span batches can hold a maximum of 1000 spans. Therefore, the span events queue size cannot be lower than 1000, as otherwise not even a single span batch can be queued. If a queue size lower than 1000 is specified, the minimum size of 1000 is used. newrelic.error_collector.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the error collector. When enabled, the agent collects and reports PHP errors to the New Relic UI. The agent records only the single most severe error for each transaction, and up to 20 errors per harvest cycle. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. newrelic.error_collector.record_database_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When enabled, the agent collects errors returned by MySQL functions as if they were PHP errors. newrelic.error_collector.prioritize_api_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to assign the highest priority to errors identified through the newrelic_notice_error() API function. newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) A comma separated list of fully-qualified exception class names that the agent should ignore. When an unhandled exception occurs, the agent will perform the equivalent of $exception instanceof Class for each of the classes listed. If any of those checks returns true, the agent will not record an exception. Depending on the supported PHP release, these values are equivalent to disabling exception reporting: Supported PHP 5 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Exceptions Supported PHP 7 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Throwable newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer or a bitwise expression of PHP-defined error constants Default: 0 Sets the error levels for the PHP agent to ignore. The value for this setting uses similar syntax to PHP's error_reporting option. For example, to configure the PHP agent to ignore E_WARNING and E_ERROR level errors, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_WARNING | E_ERROR or newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = 3 To configure the PHP agent to ignore everything but E_WARNING, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_ALL & ~E_WARNING newrelic.framework.drupal.modules Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: In agents prior to version 3.0 the default for this value was false. Setting this option implied newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail = 1. To enable Drupal module tracking, set this to true. This option has the same performance impact as newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. It will enable the recording of Drupal module functions and call counts, and they will display under the Modules tab, much like web transactions. newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true To enable WordPress hook tracking, set this to true. It will enable the recording of WordPress hooks, plugins, and themes, and they will display under the WordPress tab in the New Relic UI. newrelic.webtransaction.name.files Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" This is the same as newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions, except it uses file names to name the web transaction. The file names can be standard POSIX regular expression to be used with PCRE; for example, \"controllers/actions/.*\". newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Unless the New Relic agent detects a specific framework, such as Drupal or Wordpress, web transactions are named after the initial PHP file; for example, article.php. When the initial file is a dispatcher, this naming scheme produces less than useful data. Use this variable to specify a list of functions that are the \"actions\" generated by the dispatcher. The name of the web transaction will be the first action function executed. Example dispatch function naming If index.php dispatches to functions named: login, logout, admin, show, and edit You would set this value to \"login,logout,admin,show,edit\". The web transactions will be named login, logout, etc. instead of /index.php (the initial file name). newrelic.webtransaction.name.remove_trailing_path Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false When enabled,this removes any content in the request URI after the script name. For example, this would remove the trailing /xyz/zy from /path/to/foo.php/xyz/zy. newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow sql traces. newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. Attribute settings This section lists the settings that affect attribute collection and reporting. newrelic.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the collection of attributes generated by the PHP agent or generated by the user through newrelic_add_custom_parameter(). This setting will take precedence over all other attribute configuration settings. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: True, except for browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Control which destinations receive attributes. These configuration settings will override the .include and .exclude settings. For more information on the destinations available, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.attributes.{include|exclude} Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) This is a family of configuration options that allow fine control over the destinations of attributes. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. Other .ini settings This section lists the remaining newrelic.ini settings. newrelic.enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: (none) Enable or disable the New Relic agent. By default the New Relic PHP agent is enabled for all directories. If you have multiple sites on your web server but only want the PHP agent to monitor specific ones: Make sure newrelic.enabled is set to true at the global (SYSTEM) level in your newrelic.ini file. Set newrelic.enabled to false for one or more specific sites on a per-directory basis (PERDIR). If you need to disable the agent globally, set the newrelic.enabled value to false in the newrelic.ini file. When the agent is globally disabled, it does not initialize completely. It assumes you are globally disabling it for a critical reason, and the agent will attempt to have as close to zero impact on PHP as possible. Important You cannot globally disable the agent and then selectively enable it on a per-directory basis by using .htaccess. newrelic.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/php_agent.log\" This identifies the file name for logging messages. This is useful for debugging any issues with the agent. Whatever you set this to, ensure that: The permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. The user that PHP runs as can write to the file. Usually this is the same user as the web server. newrelic.transaction_events.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report analytics event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. newrelic.error_collector.capture_events Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report error event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show Error analytics. newrelic.feature_flag Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This setting enables new and experimental features within the PHP agent. These flags are used to selectively enable features that are intended to be enabled by default in later versions of the PHP agent. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This enables auto-insertion of the JavaScript fragments for browser monitoring. When enabled will cause the agent to insert a header and a footer in HTML output that will generate metrics on page load timing for the end-user experience. For more information, see Page load timing in PHP. newrelic.guzzle.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables support for the Guzzle library when used with New Relic. PHP agent version 6.4 or higher: This setting is set to true by default. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: Introduced in PHP agent version 9.4 Enables the detection of frameworks and libraries when preloading is enabled. Preloading was introduced in PHP version 7.4. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection will only take effect when opcache.preload is set in the php.ini file.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent supports distributed tracing (including W3C Trace Context, as of PHP Agent version 9.8), which lets you see the path that requests take as they travel through a distributed system. This document contains PHP-specific tips to enable distributed tracing for a PHP application or service. Enable distributed tracing for PHP Important When distributed tracing is enabled, it implicitly disables cross application tracing. The PHP agent will ignore the cross application tracing configuration value, and act as though this value is set to false. To enable or disable distributed tracing for the PHP agent: If applicable, update your PHP agent to support distributed tracing (version 8.4 or higher, although we recommend version 9.8 or higher for the most complete functionality). Make sure that the transaction tracer configuration option is enabled (default is true): newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true Copy Enable (or disable) distributed tracing for the PHP agent with the distributed_tracing_enabled configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy Set the transaction tracer threshold value to a suitable value. Recommendation: If you want to make all transactions eligible for a distributed trace, set this value to 0 seconds. If you are only interested in traces for longer running transactions, or if generating a trace for every transaction creates unacceptable application performance, set this value higher than 0 seconds. For example: newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold = 0 Copy Optionally, if only W3C Trace Context tracing is desired, the New Relic Distributed Tracing headers can be disabled with the newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header = 1 Enable spans with the configuration setting: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true Be sure to restart your web server (or other PHP SAPI) so the agent will pick up the newly configured values. Enable Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing (PHP agent version 9.12 or later) extends distributed tracing to collect your span data in a trace observer, which runs in a cluster of services in AWS called New Relic Edge. The PHP agent sends all your spans to the trace observer so they can be assembled into traces for you to view in New Relic. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and configure the additional settings below: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host= \"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" Leverage automatic distributed tracing instrumentation The PHP agent automatically will instrument a number of native PHP functions, as well as some third party HTTP clients, with distributed trace information. These include: PHP function file_get_contents PHP functions curl_exec and curl_multi_exec Guzzle 4, Guzzle 5, Guzzle 6 Drupal's drupal_http_request function Laravel's queue jobs Set trace detail level Distributed tracing support depends on the PHP agent's transaction tracer. When distributed tracing is enabled, a span is created for each segment seen by the transaction tracer. As spans are sampled, the PHP agent will prioritize spans related to external calls above other spans, which are then recorded in descending order of their duration. If you find that there are too many unimportant spans being reported for PHP function calls, you can reduce the detail of the transaction tracer by setting newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail to 0. You may then use the newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom configuration setting or the newrelic_add_custom_tracer API method to add trace segments and spans for the specific PHP function or methods you want to add to your traces. Important For PHP agent versions 8.4 to 8.7: When distributed tracing is enabled, these versions behave as if newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail is set to 0 (as described above), which results in PHP function calls not generating spans. To get spans related to PHP function calls, update to version 9.0 or higher. Manually instrument applications and services Important W3C Trace Context support was added in version 9.8. With this, the API for manually instrumenting applications has changed from the JSON payload related functions newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload), to the header array forms newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers) and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers). The JSON functions are now considered deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. If you're using an unsupported library, or have a non-HTTP based distributed system component (such as messaging queues), you can use the PHP agent API to manually identify transactions to be included in a distributed trace. This is a two step process: Modify your service or application to create or insert the distributed tracing data Modify your service or application to accept distributed trace data created by other transactions or requests. The following example uses a generic message/job queue. While the actual details will vary depending on what sort of system you're trying to add to a distributed trace, the core concepts are the same. Also, while we've used a job queue as an example, you can use these methods with any distributed system component. Tip When you create a payload or insert headers, you're telling New Relic you want this request or transaction or request to participate in a distributed trace. When you accept them, you're linking the current request or transaction with its parent request or transaction. For more information about using manual instrumentation to get more detail or to see connections between services, see the documentation about distributed tracing APIs. Header API Insert distributed trace headers Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to insert distributed trace headers into an array by using newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers, and then add those headers to the job's data: $outbound_headers = array(); if (newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers)) { // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the headers to the job data $job->setData('nr_dt_headers', $outbound_headers); // save the job $job->save(); } else { echo \"Unable to obtain distributed tracing headers\"; } Copy Tip Tip: The headers created via newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() are HTTP safe. This is step one: You've inserted the distributed trace headers. Accept the distributed tracing headers Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept distributed trace headers, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $inbound_headers = $job->getData('nr_dt_headers'); if($inbound_headers) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers); } $job->run(); } Copy Payload API (deprecated) Create a distributed trace payload Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to create a distributed trace payload using newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload, and then add that payload to the job's data: $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the payload data to the job data as a text json string $job->setData('dt_payload', $payload->Text()); // save the job $job->save(); Copy This is step one: You've created a distributed trace payload. Accept the distributed tracing payload Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept a distributed trace payload, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $payload = $job->getData('dt_payload'); if($payload) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload); } $job->run(); } Copy Optional: Use HTTP safe payload strings If you need to transport the payload via a mechanism that requires HTTP safe strings, (HTTP headers, URL query strings, POST fields, etc.), the API includes distributed tracing methods and functions that will create and accept HTTP safe versions of the strings. // create the HTTP safe payload string $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); $httpSafePayload = $payload->httpSafe(); // ... // accept the HTTP safe payload string newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload_httpsafe($httpSafePayload); Copy Command line PHP programs PHP programs run from the PHP command line are always sampled by the agent's distributed tracer. Depending on the programs you run, these processes could see an over-representation in your collection of distributed traces. In these situations, you can opt to disable command line instrumentation by using the per-directory newrelic.enabled setting in your newrelic.ini files.

To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the PHP agent. To use browser monitoring with your PHP agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Use auto-instrumentation To configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with the browser monitoring script, add or edit the auto-instrumentation flag in your INI file. The PHP agent will automatically inject the browser monitoring's JS snippet into your pages. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument=1 Copy Auto-instrumentation does not work when the HTTP header field Content-Length is set. To use browser monitoring in this situation, disable auto-instrumentation and manually insert the JavaScript header and footer into your templates. Manually instrument via agent API To manually configure browser monitoring, include the appropriate scripts in your pages. The New Relic PHP agent has an API to automatically generate the required JavaScript header and footer in place. Important Calls to the PHP agent API are conditional on the newrelic extension being loaded so that the PHP agent is running. If the agent is not running, calls to generate the JavaScript header and footer will result in errors, as the functions will not be defined. For more information, see: auto_instrument agent settings newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() Manually instrument for various frameworks This document does not provide detailed procedures to manually insert the Browser agent via the agent API. This is because there too many possible ways to construct a framework. The manual instrumentation examples show how to add instrumentation to frameworks that already support auto-instrumentation. If you are using another framework or modified versions of Drupal or WordPress, be sure to call the API functions for instrumentation at the right place. Insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() as part of the output page's <head> tag, preferably as the very first thing. As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples. WordPress This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a WordPress installation using the default twentyten theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/header.php. <body <?php body_class(); ?>> <div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"hfeed\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"masthead\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the end user monitoring footer in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/footer.php. ... </div><!-- #site-generator --> </div><!-- #colophon --> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> </div><!-- #footer --> Copy Drupal This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a Drupal installation using the default garland theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header right after the opening header tag in website home dir/drupal/themes/garland/page.tpl.php. <div id=\"container\" class=\"clear-block\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"logo-floater\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the footer right before the last closing layout tag: ... </div> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> <!-- /layout --> <?php print $closure ?> </body> </html> Copy Important In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's Browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent supports distributed tracing (including W3C Trace Context, as of PHP Agent version 9.8), which lets you see the path that requests take as they travel through a distributed system. This document contains PHP-specific tips to enable distributed tracing for a PHP application or service. Enable distributed tracing for PHP Important When distributed tracing is enabled, it implicitly disables cross application tracing. The PHP agent will ignore the cross application tracing configuration value, and act as though this value is set to false. To enable or disable distributed tracing for the PHP agent: If applicable, update your PHP agent to support distributed tracing (version 8.4 or higher, although we recommend version 9.8 or higher for the most complete functionality). Make sure that the transaction tracer configuration option is enabled (default is true): newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true Copy Enable (or disable) distributed tracing for the PHP agent with the distributed_tracing_enabled configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy Set the transaction tracer threshold value to a suitable value. Recommendation: If you want to make all transactions eligible for a distributed trace, set this value to 0 seconds. If you are only interested in traces for longer running transactions, or if generating a trace for every transaction creates unacceptable application performance, set this value higher than 0 seconds. For example: newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold = 0 Copy Optionally, if only W3C Trace Context tracing is desired, the New Relic Distributed Tracing headers can be disabled with the newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header = 1 Enable spans with the configuration setting: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true Be sure to restart your web server (or other PHP SAPI) so the agent will pick up the newly configured values. Enable Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing (PHP agent version 9.12 or later) extends distributed tracing to collect your span data in a trace observer, which runs in a cluster of services in AWS called New Relic Edge. The PHP agent sends all your spans to the trace observer so they can be assembled into traces for you to view in New Relic. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and configure the additional settings below: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host= \"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" Leverage automatic distributed tracing instrumentation The PHP agent automatically will instrument a number of native PHP functions, as well as some third party HTTP clients, with distributed trace information. These include: PHP function file_get_contents PHP functions curl_exec and curl_multi_exec Guzzle 4, Guzzle 5, Guzzle 6 Drupal's drupal_http_request function Laravel's queue jobs Set trace detail level Distributed tracing support depends on the PHP agent's transaction tracer. When distributed tracing is enabled, a span is created for each segment seen by the transaction tracer. As spans are sampled, the PHP agent will prioritize spans related to external calls above other spans, which are then recorded in descending order of their duration. If you find that there are too many unimportant spans being reported for PHP function calls, you can reduce the detail of the transaction tracer by setting newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail to 0. You may then use the newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom configuration setting or the newrelic_add_custom_tracer API method to add trace segments and spans for the specific PHP function or methods you want to add to your traces. Important For PHP agent versions 8.4 to 8.7: When distributed tracing is enabled, these versions behave as if newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail is set to 0 (as described above), which results in PHP function calls not generating spans. To get spans related to PHP function calls, update to version 9.0 or higher. Manually instrument applications and services Important W3C Trace Context support was added in version 9.8. With this, the API for manually instrumenting applications has changed from the JSON payload related functions newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload), to the header array forms newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers) and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers). The JSON functions are now considered deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. If you're using an unsupported library, or have a non-HTTP based distributed system component (such as messaging queues), you can use the PHP agent API to manually identify transactions to be included in a distributed trace. This is a two step process: Modify your service or application to create or insert the distributed tracing data Modify your service or application to accept distributed trace data created by other transactions or requests. The following example uses a generic message/job queue. While the actual details will vary depending on what sort of system you're trying to add to a distributed trace, the core concepts are the same. Also, while we've used a job queue as an example, you can use these methods with any distributed system component. Tip When you create a payload or insert headers, you're telling New Relic you want this request or transaction or request to participate in a distributed trace. When you accept them, you're linking the current request or transaction with its parent request or transaction. For more information about using manual instrumentation to get more detail or to see connections between services, see the documentation about distributed tracing APIs. Header API Insert distributed trace headers Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to insert distributed trace headers into an array by using newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers, and then add those headers to the job's data: $outbound_headers = array(); if (newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers)) { // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the headers to the job data $job->setData('nr_dt_headers', $outbound_headers); // save the job $job->save(); } else { echo \"Unable to obtain distributed tracing headers\"; } Copy Tip Tip: The headers created via newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() are HTTP safe. This is step one: You've inserted the distributed trace headers. Accept the distributed tracing headers Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept distributed trace headers, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $inbound_headers = $job->getData('nr_dt_headers'); if($inbound_headers) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers); } $job->run(); } Copy Payload API (deprecated) Create a distributed trace payload Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to create a distributed trace payload using newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload, and then add that payload to the job's data: $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the payload data to the job data as a text json string $job->setData('dt_payload', $payload->Text()); // save the job $job->save(); Copy This is step one: You've created a distributed trace payload. Accept the distributed tracing payload Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept a distributed trace payload, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $payload = $job->getData('dt_payload'); if($payload) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload); } $job->run(); } Copy Optional: Use HTTP safe payload strings If you need to transport the payload via a mechanism that requires HTTP safe strings, (HTTP headers, URL query strings, POST fields, etc.), the API includes distributed tracing methods and functions that will create and accept HTTP safe versions of the strings. // create the HTTP safe payload string $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); $httpSafePayload = $payload->httpSafe(); // ... // accept the HTTP safe payload string newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload_httpsafe($httpSafePayload); Copy Command line PHP programs PHP programs run from the PHP command line are always sampled by the agent's distributed tracer. Depending on the programs you run, these processes could see an over-representation in your collection of distributed traces. In these situations, you can opt to disable command line instrumentation by using the per-directory newrelic.enabled setting in your newrelic.ini files.

To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the PHP agent. To use browser monitoring with your PHP agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Use auto-instrumentation To configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with the browser monitoring script, add or edit the auto-instrumentation flag in your INI file. The PHP agent will automatically inject the browser monitoring's JS snippet into your pages. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument=1 Copy Auto-instrumentation does not work when the HTTP header field Content-Length is set. To use browser monitoring in this situation, disable auto-instrumentation and manually insert the JavaScript header and footer into your templates. Manually instrument via agent API To manually configure browser monitoring, include the appropriate scripts in your pages. The New Relic PHP agent has an API to automatically generate the required JavaScript header and footer in place. Important Calls to the PHP agent API are conditional on the newrelic extension being loaded so that the PHP agent is running. If the agent is not running, calls to generate the JavaScript header and footer will result in errors, as the functions will not be defined. For more information, see: auto_instrument agent settings newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() Manually instrument for various frameworks This document does not provide detailed procedures to manually insert the Browser agent via the agent API. This is because there too many possible ways to construct a framework. The manual instrumentation examples show how to add instrumentation to frameworks that already support auto-instrumentation. If you are using another framework or modified versions of Drupal or WordPress, be sure to call the API functions for instrumentation at the right place. Insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() as part of the output page's <head> tag, preferably as the very first thing. As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples. WordPress This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a WordPress installation using the default twentyten theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/header.php. <body <?php body_class(); ?>> <div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"hfeed\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"masthead\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the end user monitoring footer in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/footer.php. ... </div><!-- #site-generator --> </div><!-- #colophon --> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> </div><!-- #footer --> Copy Drupal This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a Drupal installation using the default garland theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header right after the opening header tag in website home dir/drupal/themes/garland/page.tpl.php. <div id=\"container\" class=\"clear-block\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"logo-floater\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the footer right before the last closing layout tag: ... </div> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> <!-- /layout --> <?php print $closure ?> </body> </html> Copy Important In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's Browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option. For how to use the API to disable browser monitoring, see newrelic_disable_autorum().

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent supports distributed tracing (including W3C Trace Context, as of PHP Agent version 9.8), which lets you see the path that requests take as they travel through a distributed system. This document contains PHP-specific tips to enable distributed tracing for a PHP application or service. Enable distributed tracing for PHP Important When distributed tracing is enabled, it implicitly disables cross application tracing. The PHP agent will ignore the cross application tracing configuration value, and act as though this value is set to false. To enable or disable distributed tracing for the PHP agent: If applicable, update your PHP agent to support distributed tracing (version 8.4 or higher, although we recommend version 9.8 or higher for the most complete functionality). Make sure that the transaction tracer configuration option is enabled (default is true): newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true Copy Enable (or disable) distributed tracing for the PHP agent with the distributed_tracing_enabled configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy Set the transaction tracer threshold value to a suitable value. Recommendation: If you want to make all transactions eligible for a distributed trace, set this value to 0 seconds. If you are only interested in traces for longer running transactions, or if generating a trace for every transaction creates unacceptable application performance, set this value higher than 0 seconds. For example: newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold = 0 Copy Optionally, if only W3C Trace Context tracing is desired, the New Relic Distributed Tracing headers can be disabled with the newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header = 1 Enable spans with the configuration setting: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true Be sure to restart your web server (or other PHP SAPI) so the agent will pick up the newly configured values. Enable Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing (PHP agent version 9.12 or later) extends distributed tracing to collect your span data in a trace observer, which runs in a cluster of services in AWS called New Relic Edge. The PHP agent sends all your spans to the trace observer so they can be assembled into traces for you to view in New Relic. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and configure the additional settings below: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host= \"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" Leverage automatic distributed tracing instrumentation The PHP agent automatically will instrument a number of native PHP functions, as well as some third party HTTP clients, with distributed trace information. These include: PHP function file_get_contents PHP functions curl_exec and curl_multi_exec Guzzle 4, Guzzle 5, Guzzle 6 Drupal's drupal_http_request function Laravel's queue jobs Set trace detail level Distributed tracing support depends on the PHP agent's transaction tracer. When distributed tracing is enabled, a span is created for each segment seen by the transaction tracer. As spans are sampled, the PHP agent will prioritize spans related to external calls above other spans, which are then recorded in descending order of their duration. If you find that there are too many unimportant spans being reported for PHP function calls, you can reduce the detail of the transaction tracer by setting newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail to 0. You may then use the newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom configuration setting or the newrelic_add_custom_tracer API method to add trace segments and spans for the specific PHP function or methods you want to add to your traces. Important For PHP agent versions 8.4 to 8.7: When distributed tracing is enabled, these versions behave as if newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail is set to 0 (as described above), which results in PHP function calls not generating spans. To get spans related to PHP function calls, update to version 9.0 or higher. Manually instrument applications and services Important W3C Trace Context support was added in version 9.8. With this, the API for manually instrumenting applications has changed from the JSON payload related functions newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload), to the header array forms newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers) and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers). The JSON functions are now considered deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. If you're using an unsupported library, or have a non-HTTP based distributed system component (such as messaging queues), you can use the PHP agent API to manually identify transactions to be included in a distributed trace. This is a two step process: Modify your service or application to create or insert the distributed tracing data Modify your service or application to accept distributed trace data created by other transactions or requests. The following example uses a generic message/job queue. While the actual details will vary depending on what sort of system you're trying to add to a distributed trace, the core concepts are the same. Also, while we've used a job queue as an example, you can use these methods with any distributed system component. Tip When you create a payload or insert headers, you're telling New Relic you want this request or transaction or request to participate in a distributed trace. When you accept them, you're linking the current request or transaction with its parent request or transaction. For more information about using manual instrumentation to get more detail or to see connections between services, see the documentation about distributed tracing APIs. Header API Insert distributed trace headers Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to insert distributed trace headers into an array by using newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers, and then add those headers to the job's data: $outbound_headers = array(); if (newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers)) { // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the headers to the job data $job->setData('nr_dt_headers', $outbound_headers); // save the job $job->save(); } else { echo \"Unable to obtain distributed tracing headers\"; } Copy Tip Tip: The headers created via newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() are HTTP safe. This is step one: You've inserted the distributed trace headers. Accept the distributed tracing headers Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept distributed trace headers, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $inbound_headers = $job->getData('nr_dt_headers'); if($inbound_headers) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers); } $job->run(); } Copy Payload API (deprecated) Create a distributed trace payload Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to create a distributed trace payload using newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload, and then add that payload to the job's data: $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the payload data to the job data as a text json string $job->setData('dt_payload', $payload->Text()); // save the job $job->save(); Copy This is step one: You've created a distributed trace payload. Accept the distributed tracing payload Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept a distributed trace payload, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $payload = $job->getData('dt_payload'); if($payload) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload); } $job->run(); } Copy Optional: Use HTTP safe payload strings If you need to transport the payload via a mechanism that requires HTTP safe strings, (HTTP headers, URL query strings, POST fields, etc.), the API includes distributed tracing methods and functions that will create and accept HTTP safe versions of the strings. // create the HTTP safe payload string $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); $httpSafePayload = $payload->httpSafe(); // ... // accept the HTTP safe payload string newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload_httpsafe($httpSafePayload); Copy Command line PHP programs PHP programs run from the PHP command line are always sampled by the agent's distributed tracer. Depending on the programs you run, these processes could see an over-representation in your collection of distributed traces. In these situations, you can opt to disable command line instrumentation by using the per-directory newrelic.enabled setting in your newrelic.ini files.

To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the PHP agent. To use browser monitoring with your PHP agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Use auto-instrumentation To configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with the browser monitoring script, add or edit the auto-instrumentation flag in your INI file. The PHP agent will automatically inject the browser monitoring's JS snippet into your pages. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument=1 Copy Auto-instrumentation does not work when the HTTP header field Content-Length is set. To use browser monitoring in this situation, disable auto-instrumentation and manually insert the JavaScript header and footer into your templates. Manually instrument via agent API To manually configure browser monitoring, include the appropriate scripts in your pages. The New Relic PHP agent has an API to automatically generate the required JavaScript header and footer in place. Important Calls to the PHP agent API are conditional on the newrelic extension being loaded so that the PHP agent is running. If the agent is not running, calls to generate the JavaScript header and footer will result in errors, as the functions will not be defined. For more information, see: auto_instrument agent settings newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() Manually instrument for various frameworks This document does not provide detailed procedures to manually insert the Browser agent via the agent API. This is because there too many possible ways to construct a framework. The manual instrumentation examples show how to add instrumentation to frameworks that already support auto-instrumentation. If you are using another framework or modified versions of Drupal or WordPress, be sure to call the API functions for instrumentation at the right place. Insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() as part of the output page's <head> tag, preferably as the very first thing. As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples. WordPress This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a WordPress installation using the default twentyten theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/header.php. <body <?php body_class(); ?>> <div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"hfeed\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"masthead\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the end user monitoring footer in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/footer.php. ... </div><!-- #site-generator --> </div><!-- #colophon --> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> </div><!-- #footer --> Copy Drupal This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a Drupal installation using the default garland theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header right after the opening header tag in website home dir/drupal/themes/garland/page.tpl.php. <div id=\"container\" class=\"clear-block\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"logo-floater\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the footer right before the last closing layout tag: ... </div> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> <!-- /layout --> <?php print $closure ?> </body> </html> Copy Important In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's Browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option. For how to use the API to disable browser monitoring, see newrelic_disable_autorum().

To enable or disable distributed tracing for the PHP agent: If applicable, update your PHP agent to support distributed tracing (version 8.4 or higher, although we recommend version 9.8 or higher for the most complete functionality). Make sure that the transaction tracer configuration option is enabled (default is true): newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true Copy Enable (or disable) distributed tracing for the PHP agent with the distributed_tracing_enabled configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy Set the transaction tracer threshold value to a suitable value. Recommendation: If you want to make all transactions eligible for a distributed trace, set this value to 0 seconds. If you are only interested in traces for longer running transactions, or if generating a trace for every transaction creates unacceptable application performance, set this value higher than 0 seconds. For example: newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold = 0 Copy Optionally, if only W3C Trace Context tracing is desired, the New Relic Distributed Tracing headers can be disabled with the newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header = 1 Enable spans with the configuration setting: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true Be sure to restart your web server (or other PHP SAPI) so the agent will pick up the newly configured values. Enable Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing (PHP agent version 9.12 or later) extends distributed tracing to collect your span data in a trace observer, which runs in a cluster of services in AWS called New Relic Edge. The PHP agent sends all your spans to the trace observer so they can be assembled into traces for you to view in New Relic. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and configure the additional settings below: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host= \"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" Leverage automatic distributed tracing instrumentation The PHP agent automatically will instrument a number of native PHP functions, as well as some third party HTTP clients, with distributed trace information. These include: PHP function file_get_contents PHP functions curl_exec and curl_multi_exec Guzzle 4, Guzzle 5, Guzzle 6 Drupal's drupal_http_request function Laravel's queue jobs Set trace detail level Distributed tracing support depends on the PHP agent's transaction tracer. When distributed tracing is enabled, a span is created for each segment seen by the transaction tracer. As spans are sampled, the PHP agent will prioritize spans related to external calls above other spans, which are then recorded in descending order of their duration. If you find that there are too many unimportant spans being reported for PHP function calls, you can reduce the detail of the transaction tracer by setting newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail to 0. You may then use the newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom configuration setting or the newrelic_add_custom_tracer API method to add trace segments and spans for the specific PHP function or methods you want to add to your traces. Important For PHP agent versions 8.4 to 8.7: When distributed tracing is enabled, these versions behave as if newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail is set to 0 (as described above), which results in PHP function calls not generating spans. To get spans related to PHP function calls, update to version 9.0 or higher. Manually instrument applications and services Important W3C Trace Context support was added in version 9.8. With this, the API for manually instrumenting applications has changed from the JSON payload related functions newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload), to the header array forms newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers) and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers). The JSON functions are now considered deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. If you're using an unsupported library, or have a non-HTTP based distributed system component (such as messaging queues), you can use the PHP agent API to manually identify transactions to be included in a distributed trace. This is a two step process: Modify your service or application to create or insert the distributed tracing data Modify your service or application to accept distributed trace data created by other transactions or requests. The following example uses a generic message/job queue. While the actual details will vary depending on what sort of system you're trying to add to a distributed trace, the core concepts are the same. Also, while we've used a job queue as an example, you can use these methods with any distributed system component. Tip When you create a payload or insert headers, you're telling New Relic you want this request or transaction or request to participate in a distributed trace. When you accept them, you're linking the current request or transaction with its parent request or transaction. For more information about using manual instrumentation to get more detail or to see connections between services, see the documentation about distributed tracing APIs. Header API Insert distributed trace headers Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to insert distributed trace headers into an array by using newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers, and then add those headers to the job's data: $outbound_headers = array(); if (newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers)) { // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the headers to the job data $job->setData('nr_dt_headers', $outbound_headers); // save the job $job->save(); } else { echo \"Unable to obtain distributed tracing headers\"; } Copy Tip Tip: The headers created via newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() are HTTP safe. This is step one: You've inserted the distributed trace headers. Accept the distributed tracing headers Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept distributed trace headers, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $inbound_headers = $job->getData('nr_dt_headers'); if($inbound_headers) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers); } $job->run(); } Copy Payload API (deprecated) Create a distributed trace payload Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to create a distributed trace payload using newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload, and then add that payload to the job's data: $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the payload data to the job data as a text json string $job->setData('dt_payload', $payload->Text()); // save the job $job->save(); Copy This is step one: You've created a distributed trace payload. Accept the distributed tracing payload Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept a distributed trace payload, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $payload = $job->getData('dt_payload'); if($payload) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload); } $job->run(); } Copy Optional: Use HTTP safe payload strings If you need to transport the payload via a mechanism that requires HTTP safe strings, (HTTP headers, URL query strings, POST fields, etc.), the API includes distributed tracing methods and functions that will create and accept HTTP safe versions of the strings. // create the HTTP safe payload string $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); $httpSafePayload = $payload->httpSafe(); // ... // accept the HTTP safe payload string newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload_httpsafe($httpSafePayload); Copy Command line PHP programs PHP programs run from the PHP command line are always sampled by the agent's distributed tracer. Depending on the programs you run, these processes could see an over-representation in your collection of distributed traces. In these situations, you can opt to disable command line instrumentation by using the per-directory newrelic.enabled setting in your newrelic.ini files.

To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the PHP agent. To use browser monitoring with your PHP agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Use auto-instrumentation To configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with the browser monitoring script, add or edit the auto-instrumentation flag in your INI file. The PHP agent will automatically inject the browser monitoring's JS snippet into your pages. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument=1 Copy Auto-instrumentation does not work when the HTTP header field Content-Length is set. To use browser monitoring in this situation, disable auto-instrumentation and manually insert the JavaScript header and footer into your templates. Manually instrument via agent API To manually configure browser monitoring, include the appropriate scripts in your pages. The New Relic PHP agent has an API to automatically generate the required JavaScript header and footer in place. Important Calls to the PHP agent API are conditional on the newrelic extension being loaded so that the PHP agent is running. If the agent is not running, calls to generate the JavaScript header and footer will result in errors, as the functions will not be defined. For more information, see: auto_instrument agent settings newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() Manually instrument for various frameworks This document does not provide detailed procedures to manually insert the Browser agent via the agent API. This is because there too many possible ways to construct a framework. The manual instrumentation examples show how to add instrumentation to frameworks that already support auto-instrumentation. If you are using another framework or modified versions of Drupal or WordPress, be sure to call the API functions for instrumentation at the right place. Insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() as part of the output page's <head> tag, preferably as the very first thing. As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples. WordPress This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a WordPress installation using the default twentyten theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/header.php. <body <?php body_class(); ?>> <div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"hfeed\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"masthead\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the end user monitoring footer in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/footer.php. ... </div><!-- #site-generator --> </div><!-- #colophon --> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> </div><!-- #footer --> Copy Drupal This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a Drupal installation using the default garland theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header right after the opening header tag in website home dir/drupal/themes/garland/page.tpl.php. <div id=\"container\" class=\"clear-block\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"logo-floater\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the footer right before the last closing layout tag: ... </div> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> <!-- /layout --> <?php print $closure ?> </body> </html> Copy Important In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's Browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

Timing with Guzzle 6 Unlike previous versions, Guzzle 6 does not generate an event when a request is sent. Instead, the agent begins timing a request when the request object is created. If a request object is created and additional work is done before sending, New Relic may report that the request took longer than it actually did.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

To discover which call was the slowest, view the External Services page which displays timing for individual external calls. Sequential requests This PHP code makes multiple sequential requests with Guzzle: $client = new \\GuzzleHttp\\Client; $response = $client->get('http://YOUR_SITE.com/api/foo'); $client->delete('http://YOUR_SITE.com/api/foo/'.$response->getBody()); Copy This code would appear in the New Relic UI as: one.newrelic.com > APM > (selected app) > Overview > Web transactions time: Sequential requests with Guzzle in the New Relic UI.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

      "body": "If you install New Relic for WordPress websites, the PHP agent receives additional metrics. A WordPress page appears in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select a WordPress app). Configuration You can control which WordPress-specific metrics your app sends to New Relic by using the PHP agent's ini setting newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks. This is enabled by default in versions 5.3 or higher, and it can be disabled with: newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks = false Copy Although this setting uses the word .hooks, it controls all WordPress metrics sent to New Relic, including hooks, plugins, and themes. Metrics The PHP agent receives metrics for the following: Hooks: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions apply_filters, apply_filters_ref_array, do_action, and do_action_ref_array. Plugins and themes: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress plugin and theme. Time is calculated from the dispatch functions for hooks. Integration with New Relic partners By integrating your WordPress application with APM, you can view performance directly from your WordPress app's Administration page. For example, W3 Total Cache is one of New Relic's Connect partners that specializes in WordPress apps. WordPress plugin for browser monitoring Signing up for a New Relic account and adding browser monitoring to your WordPress site is fast and easy with the browser monitoring plugin for WordPress.

Parallel requests This PHP code makes multiple requests in parallel by unwrapping an array of promises: $client = new \\GuzzleHttp\\Client; $promises = [ $client->getAsync('http://YOUR_SITE.com/api/foo'), $client->getAsync('http://YOUR_SITE.com/api/bar'), $client->getAsync('http://YOUR_SITE.com/api/quux'), ]; \\GuzzleHttp\\Promise\\unwrap($promises); Copy This code would appear in the New Relic UI as: one.newrelic.com > APM > (selected app) > Summary > Web transactions time: Parallel requests with Guzzle in the New Relic UI The green web external time represents time spent in the Guzzle library.

Timing with Guzzle 6 Unlike previous versions, Guzzle 6 does not generate an event when a request is sent. Instead, the agent begins timing a request when the request object is created. If a request object is created and additional work is done before sending, New Relic may report that the request took longer than it actually did. Disable Guzzle support To disable Guzzle support: Add newrelic.guzzle.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini file. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.).

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Alert your team when errors or problems occur before they affect your users Track performance after a deploy Drill down into performance details Examine code-level transaction traces Examine database query traces Examine error traces Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP) For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "The PHP agent consists of two parts: The PHP extension module, newrelic.so The agent daemon, newrelic-daemon The daemon acts as a proxy between the PHP agent and the New Relic collector to reduce network traffic and to improve response time for instrumented applications. If the daemon is not running, no data is reported to New Relic. PHP daemon initial or idle states When the daemon is in an initial or idle state, two transactions must occur before it will start reporting. In an initial state: With the first transaction, the daemon adds your newly-reporting application to its own application information table. Once the application is added, the daemon reports the second transaction to New Relic. In an idle state: The first transaction wakes up the daemon and re-establishes the connection to New Relic. The second transaction reports data to New Relic. Watchdog and worker processes If you do a process listing, you will see that there are always two daemon processes running: $ ps -ef | grep newrelic-daemon newrelic 1368 1 0 00:28 ? 00:00:00 /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon ... newrelic 1370 1368 0 00:28 ? 00:00:00 /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon ... Copy Having two processes running is normal behavior. The first column is the process owner, the second is the process ID (PID), and the third is the parent process ID (PPID). Daemon processes Comments Watchdog (first process) The first process, the one owned by PID 1, is the \"watchdog\" process. It watches the second process, which is the \"worker\" process. Worker (second process) The worker process does the following: Accepts connections from the PHP agent Gathers metrics Communicates with the New Relic collector Terminating processes When the daemon is being gracefully terminated (usually by running /etc/init.d/newrelic-daemon stop), it will send a termination signal to the watchdog process. This will cleanly terminate the worker process and give it a chance to send any pending data to New Relic. Important If you need to manually terminate the daemon, always terminate the watchdog, not the worker. If the worker process encounters a fatal error and terminates unexpectedly, the watchdog process will immediately re-spawn a new worker process. This helps to ensure that the daemon experiences absolute minimum downtime. Stop the daemon The following methods can be used to kill the daemon: Recommended process: Use /etc/init.d/newrelic-daemon stop. This is the preferred method for interacting with the daemon. Kill the process directly with its process ID: kill 1368 Copy Use the watchdog PID file: kill `cat /var/run/newrelic-daemon.pid` Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP) For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue.

Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP) For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "The PHP agent consists of two parts: The PHP extension module, newrelic.so The agent daemon, newrelic-daemon The daemon acts as a proxy between the PHP agent and the New Relic collector to reduce network traffic and to improve response time for instrumented applications. If the daemon is not running, no data is reported to New Relic. PHP daemon initial or idle states When the daemon is in an initial or idle state, two transactions must occur before it will start reporting. In an initial state: With the first transaction, the daemon adds your newly-reporting application to its own application information table. Once the application is added, the daemon reports the second transaction to New Relic. In an idle state: The first transaction wakes up the daemon and re-establishes the connection to New Relic. The second transaction reports data to New Relic. Watchdog and worker processes If you do a process listing, you will see that there are always two daemon processes running: $ ps -ef | grep newrelic-daemon newrelic 1368 1 0 00:28 ? 00:00:00 /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon ... newrelic 1370 1368 0 00:28 ? 00:00:00 /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon ... Copy Having two processes running is normal behavior. The first column is the process owner, the second is the process ID (PID), and the third is the parent process ID (PPID). Daemon processes Comments Watchdog (first process) The first process, the one owned by PID 1, is the \"watchdog\" process. It watches the second process, which is the \"worker\" process. Worker (second process) The worker process does the following: Accepts connections from the PHP agent Gathers metrics Communicates with the New Relic collector Terminating processes When the daemon is being gracefully terminated (usually by running /etc/init.d/newrelic-daemon stop), it will send a termination signal to the watchdog process. This will cleanly terminate the worker process and give it a chance to send any pending data to New Relic. Important If you need to manually terminate the daemon, always terminate the watchdog, not the worker. If the worker process encounters a fatal error and terminates unexpectedly, the watchdog process will immediately re-spawn a new worker process. This helps to ensure that the daemon experiences absolute minimum downtime. Stop the daemon The following methods can be used to kill the daemon: Recommended process: Use /etc/init.d/newrelic-daemon stop. This is the preferred method for interacting with the daemon. Kill the process directly with its process ID: kill 1368 Copy Use the watchdog PID file: kill `cat /var/run/newrelic-daemon.pid` Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku.

You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Add PHP data PHP components Our PHP agent consists of two basic components: A PHP extension, which collects data from your application A local proxy daemon, which transmits the data to New Relic Your system's configuration components, including the web server, operating system, system permissions, PHP installation itself, package manager, etc., are all important factors during installation and configuration, because the agent is a part of that. For more information about supported PHP releases, frameworks, and other system requirements, see PHP compatibility and requirements. Install the agent Follow this general process to install the agent on your system. The agent installation package or tar archive includes the interactive newrelic-install script, which automates some installation tasks. Tip If your application is frequently inactive, we recommend you generate some data by interacting with the application or site. This will help ensure the agent initially connects. Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements, including appropriate system permissions. If you do not already have a New Relic account, create one. From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website. Install the package with your preferred package manager (yum or rpm) and then run the newrelic-install script. Ubuntu or Debian Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Recommendation: To help ensure the PHP agent is initiated, especially if your application has infrequent activity, generate some data by using the app for a few seconds. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI. Install PHP with partnership accounts Installation procedures may be different for admins who install the PHP agent through a New Relic partnership.

You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

You can use our launcher, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic PHP agent installation. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Add PHP data PHP components Our PHP agent consists of two basic components: A PHP extension, which collects data from your application A local proxy daemon, which transmits the data to New Relic Your system's configuration components, including the web server, operating system, system permissions, PHP installation itself, package manager, etc., are all important factors during installation and configuration, because the agent is a part of that. For more information about supported PHP releases, frameworks, and other system requirements, see PHP compatibility and requirements. Install the agent Follow this general process to install the agent on your system. The agent installation package or tar archive includes the interactive newrelic-install script, which automates some installation tasks. Tip If your application is frequently inactive, we recommend you generate some data by interacting with the application or site. This will help ensure the agent initially connects. Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements, including appropriate system permissions. If you do not already have a New Relic account, create one. From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website. Install the package with your preferred package manager (yum or rpm) and then run the newrelic-install script. Ubuntu or Debian Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Recommendation: To help ensure the PHP agent is initiated, especially if your application has infrequent activity, generate some data by using the app for a few seconds. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI. Install PHP with partnership accounts Installation procedures may be different for admins who install the PHP agent through a New Relic partnership. For more information, see: AWS Heroku Magento Shared hosting providers Other partnership installation procedures Not all partners support PHP agents.

With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

(The call name is newrelic_add_custom_span_parameter because \"custom attributes\" were previously called \"custom parameters.\") For example, you can add a customer's full name from your customer database. This attribute appears in any span. You can also query the Span for your custom attributes. Important On spans, attributes added with newrelic_add_custom_span_parameter will take precedence over attributes added with newrelic_add_custom_parameter. Important If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL. Parameters Parameter Description $key string Required. The name of the custom attribute. Only the first 255 characters are retained. $value scalar Required. The value to associate with this custom attribute. If the value given is a float with a value of NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. For other floating point values, the agent may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the parameter was added successfully.

Solution If no data appears after you generate traffic to your app and wait at least five minutes, use New Relic Diagnostics to automatically detect common problems and suggest troubleshooting. If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent.

Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt.

To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent.

If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

      "body": "The Python agent admin script is used during the installation process. When the Python agent package is installed, the newrelic-admin script is also installed into the bin directory of the Python installation or virtual environment. This document gives more in-depth detail about these uses of the admin script: Generating the initial agent configuration file Validating your config file Testing the connection to New Relic Wrapping startup of standalone Python web applications Subcommand structure To execute subcommands, provide the name of the subcommand as the first argument to the newrelic-admin script. Then add any options after the name of the subcommand. For example: newrelic-admin help Copy help < command> When executed with no further arguments, this provides a listing of all accepted subcommands: $ newrelic-admin help Usage: newrelic-admin command [options] Type 'newrelic-admin help <command>' for help on any of the commands listed in this document. To view additional details about a subcommand, run the help command with the subcommand and any of its options. For example: $ newrelic-admin help generate-config Usage: newrelic-admin generate-config license_key [output_file] Generates a sample agent configuration file for <license_key> Copy generate-config license_key [ output_file] Generates a sample agent configuration file. The license_key option is your New Relic license key. By default the sample configuration file will be directed to standard output and be displayed on your screen. To capture the output, you can instead save it to a file by giving the name of the file as the output_file option. When the sample agent configuration file is generated, only the license key option in the file is updated. You should still edit the file and make changes to app_name and log_file options as appropriate. For more information, see Python agent installation. If you cannot run the generate-config command to produce the initial agent configuration file, you can download a sample configuration file from download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/newrelic.ini. validate-config config_file [ log_file] Validates the syntax of an agent configuration file given by the config_file option. This might be the agent configuration generated by generate-config and subsequently edited, or an agent configuration file created by downloading the sample configuration file from the download site. As well as validating the syntax of the configuration file, using the license_key contained in the agent configuration file to identify your account, will also test whether a connection can be made to the our servers. This subcommand can therefore be used to ensure that DNS is available for resolving the hostname of the our data collector host and that there is network connectivity available and that no firewall is blocking access. In connecting to the our servers, the test will create an application under your account called Python Agent Test. Into this application a small amount of simulated web transaction data and errors will be reported. After a period of time this application in your account will be able to be deleted from the Applications list if desired. When this test is run, a log file will be created in the location: /tmp/python-agent-test.log Copy If you need to override this location you can supply the log_file option. To have what would be written to the log file be displayed to your screen, you can use stdout or stderr as the value passed as the log_file option. When using a hosting service such as Heroku where an agent configuration file wouldn't normally be used, this subcommand can still be used to test the connection to us. For Heroku the license key information is defined in an environment variable automatically setup by Heroku when you add the New Relic addon to your Heroku instance. In this case where an environment variable is used to define the license key, to run the connectivity test, pass the value - for the config_file option in place of the path to the agent configuration file. So, to run the command on your Heroku instance you would use: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy Note that we have supplied stdout for the log file in this case, else it would be necessary to separately retrieve the log file generated. It is recommended that when setting up the Python agent for the first time, or even perhaps on a new host, that this subcommand be used to test whether data can be reported okay. For more information, see Testing the Python agent. run-program ... Executes the command line for a Python web application given as ... but forces the initialization of the agent automatically at startup. This is a shortcut method for starting up a Python web application without needing to manually make changes to the web application to add code to specifically initialize the Python agent. It can be used in any situation where a Python web framework or WSGI server is used where instrumentation is being automatically added to wrap the WSGI application entry point. In other words, in situations where only the agent initialization code needed to be added. Agent configuration when using this method can be provided in two different ways. If using a complete agent configuration file then the location of that configuration can be provided by the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you were using gunicorn for example, you could say: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn wsgi:application Copy OR NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini export NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn wsgi:application Copy When specifying the location of the configuration file using the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable, the following additional environment variables can be set to customize how the configuration file is processed. NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT: The name of a specific deployment environment. When specified, additional override configuration will be read from a separate deployment section within the configuration file. The section of the configuration file for a specific deployment environment should be named as newrelic:environment where environment is replaced with the name being specified by this environment variable In place of a complete agent configuration file, you can also set environment variables providing only the key agent configuration information. The environment variables which can be set in this case are: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY - Your New Relic license key. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME - The name of the application you wish to report data against in the UI. If not defined, this defaults to Python Application. NEW_RELIC_LOG - The path to a file to be used for the agent log. If not defined then no logging will occur. Can also be set to stdout or stderr to have logging go to standard output or standard error for process. NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL - The level at which logging will be output by the agent. If not defined then defaults to info. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: critical, error, warning, info and debug. Individual environment variables are used when hosting your application on Heroku. The environment variables will be set automatically as appropriate by the Heroku environment when you add the New Relic addon. It is therefore not necessary when using Heroku to set any of the above environment variables when using the newrelic-admin command with this option from your Procfile. Note that the wrapped program must be using the same Python installation or virtual environment as that which the Python agent package and the newrelic-admin script was installed into. If this is not the case then the wrapper script will have no affect and you may even encounter an error on startup of the Python interpreter due to the newrelic Python package not being able to be found. If using sudo to startup your WSGI application as another user, be aware that the default sudo configuration will generally be such that user environment variables from the shell in which sudo is run will be ignored. In this case you would need to change the sudoers configuration to allow passing of the specific environment variables. Alternatively, create a shell script which sets the environment variables and runs your WSGI application under newrelic-admin. To start up your WSGI application as a different user, then run sudo on that script rather than directly on your WSGI application. The use of an additional wrapper script to set the environment variables and run your WSGI application under newrelic-admin may also be required when using supervisord if any issues are encountered with environment variable settings within the supervisord configuration not being passed through correctly. run-python ... Executes the python executable from the Python installation or virtual environment that newrelic-admin is installed into with the arguments given as ... but forces the initialization of the agent automatically at startup. This is a shortcut method for starting up a Python web application without needing to manually make changes to the web application to add code to specifically initialize the Python agent. It can be used in any situation where a Python web framework or WSGI server is used where instrumentation is being automatically added to wrap the WSGI application entry point. In other words, in situations where only the agent initialization code needed to be added. As for run-program subcommand above, environment variables are used to configure the Python agent. If you were using python executable directly for example, you could say: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-python wsgi.py Copy OR NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini export NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE newrelic-admin run-python wsgi.py Copy license-key config_file [ log_file] Outputs the license key which will be used. This can be used in any startup scripts prior to starting up of the actual WSGI application to log the license key for the purpose of verifying that the correct value is being used. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin license-key newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting the license key using environment variables, use - as the name of the configuration file: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR-LICENSE-KEY' export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY newrelic-admin license-key - Copy Output will be in the form: license_key = 'YOUR-LICENSE-KEY' Copy If no license key was found in the agent configuration file or picked up from user environment variables, the output will be: license_key = None Copy network-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the network configuration which will be used. This can be used in any startup scripts prior to starting up of the actual WSGI application to log the network configuration for the purpose of verifying that the correct values are being used. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin network-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting any proxy information using environment variables, use - as the name of the configuration file: NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST=proxy.example.com export NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT=8888 export NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT newrelic-admin network-config - Copy Output will be in the form: host = 'collector.newrelic.com' port = 0 proxy_host = 'proxy.example.com' proxy_port = 8888 proxy_user = None proxy_pass = None ssl = True Copy A value of 0 for port indicates that the port number, either 80 or 443, will be automatically selected based on whether an SSL connection is being used to communicate with our data collector. local-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the local agent configuration based on built-in defaults, environment variables, and any agent configuration file. This information may be requested by our technical support when trying to debug any agent startup issues. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin local-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting any settings using environment variables, you can use - as the name of the configuration file: newrelic-admin local-config - Copy server-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the full configuration for a specific application. This will be the local agent configuration, overridden by any server-side configuration for the specific application. This information may be requested by our technical support when trying to debug any agent startup issues. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin server-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If changing any settings using environment variables, you can use - as the name of the configuration file: newrelic-admin server-config - Copy In order to obtain the server-side configuration, this script will force agent registration for the specific application defined by the configuration. If that application does not already appear in the user interface for APM, an entry for it will be created, but no metric data will be reported against it. record-deploy config_file description This is a wrapper around the New Relic REST API to record deployments for your application. You can also record deployments directly via the REST API. To use the command: Add your API key in the agent configuration file (newrelic.ini) by adding a line similar to the following in the [newrelic] section: api_key=substitute-your-api-key-here Copy Call the newrelic-admin command from the command line. (Do not add it to your config file.) using the following subcommand structure: newrelic-admin record-deploy config_file description [revision changelog user] Copy This subcommand has two required arguments: config_file: Path to the config file name description: Text to describe or identify the deployment; for example, the Git commit comments There are also three optional arguments: revision: Identifies a specific revision being deployed changelog: Provides a detailed log of what changes were made user: Identifies the person responsible for the deployment",

      "body": "If you are having problems using the Java agent API for async tokens and segments, use these techniques to help you find answers and solve problems. Verify your instrumentation The API has a number of built-in safety mechanisms to prevent issues caused by incorrect API usage, but you can use these techniques to verify that your application’s instrumentation is correct: After instrumenting your code, verify that the logs show that an equal number of tokens have been created and expired. For more information on which log messages to look for, see Use logs to troubleshoot. Check the garbage collection statistics under APM's JVMs page to determine whether or not your changes have significantly altered garbage collection patterns. Check if any segments or tokens are timing out by reviewing your transaction traces for a timed_out attribute. If so, you can change the limit with token_timeout and segment_timeout. Use logs to troubleshoot To customize your Java agent logging, see Generating logs. Then, you can examine your logs for these common messages: To view created tokens, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: created active token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view expired tokens and the time that they expired, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: expired token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view created segments, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04: startSegment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 created and started with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy To view ended segments and the time that they ended, check logs at FINEST for: com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04--finish segment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 async finish with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy Problem: Transaction times are too long Make sure to expire tokens and end or ignore segments; otherwise transactions may take longer to report to New Relic. The Java agent has a timeout mechanism for tokens and segments that are not ended correctly. For more information, see token_timeout and segment_timeout. Problem: No transaction trace data Inspect transaction traces to make sure expected asynchronous work is reported. If you do not see any transaction traces, make sure your transaction duration exceeds the transaction trace threshold set in transaction_threshold. Problem: Too few async calls If too few calls are being reported: Ensure that each activity you monitor is appropriately linked In the faulty example below, a parallel stream is being used, which means that the work done inside the lambda in the call to map() can be scheduled on a different thread than the thread handling the request. Without creating a token to link all this work together, you will not see any of the work that gets scheduled on a different thread inside of your transaction. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(i -> requestItem(i)) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad\", results); } Copy Check if you are missing required annotations The example below will report only a subset of the calls to requestItem() because it is impossible to put @Trace(async = true) around blocks of anonymous work inside the call to map(). Instead, you should pass the token into requestItem() and link it, and then add @Trace(async=true) around it. Or use a helper function like requestItemAsync() to do this without changing your existing methods. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad2\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad2(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> { token.link(); return requestItem(id); }) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad2\", results); } Copy Compare this to the correct example below, in which the lambda expression is wrapped by the wrapper class InstrumentedCallable. This class accepts a token and a lambda, then wraps asynchronous work in @Trace(async = true) and uses a token to link the work to the request thread. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_wrap\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamWrap(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> InstrumentedCallable.instrumentCallable(token, () -> requestItem(id))) .map(c -> c.call()) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire(); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_wrap\", results); } Copy",

      "body": "If you are having problems using the Java agent API for async tokens and segments, use these techniques to help you find answers and solve problems. Verify your instrumentation The API has a number of built-in safety mechanisms to prevent issues caused by incorrect API usage, but you can use these techniques to verify that your application’s instrumentation is correct: After instrumenting your code, verify that the logs show that an equal number of tokens have been created and expired. For more information on which log messages to look for, see Use logs to troubleshoot. Check the garbage collection statistics under APM's JVMs page to determine whether or not your changes have significantly altered garbage collection patterns. Check if any segments or tokens are timing out by reviewing your transaction traces for a timed_out attribute. If so, you can change the limit with token_timeout and segment_timeout. Use logs to troubleshoot To customize your Java agent logging, see Generating logs. Then, you can examine your logs for these common messages: To view created tokens, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: created active token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view expired tokens and the time that they expired, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: expired token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view created segments, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04: startSegment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 created and started with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy To view ended segments and the time that they ended, check logs at FINEST for: com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04--finish segment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 async finish with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy Problem: Transaction times are too long Make sure to expire tokens and end or ignore segments; otherwise transactions may take longer to report to New Relic. The Java agent has a timeout mechanism for tokens and segments that are not ended correctly. For more information, see token_timeout and segment_timeout. Problem: No transaction trace data Inspect transaction traces to make sure expected asynchronous work is reported. If you do not see any transaction traces, make sure your transaction duration exceeds the transaction trace threshold set in transaction_threshold. Problem: Too few async calls If too few calls are being reported: Ensure that each activity you monitor is appropriately linked In the faulty example below, a parallel stream is being used, which means that the work done inside the lambda in the call to map() can be scheduled on a different thread than the thread handling the request. Without creating a token to link all this work together, you will not see any of the work that gets scheduled on a different thread inside of your transaction. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(i -> requestItem(i)) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad\", results); } Copy Check if you are missing required annotations The example below will report only a subset of the calls to requestItem() because it is impossible to put @Trace(async = true) around blocks of anonymous work inside the call to map(). Instead, you should pass the token into requestItem() and link it, and then add @Trace(async=true) around it. Or use a helper function like requestItemAsync() to do this without changing your existing methods. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad2\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad2(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> { token.link(); return requestItem(id); }) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad2\", results); } Copy Compare this to the correct example below, in which the lambda expression is wrapped by the wrapper class InstrumentedCallable. This class accepts a token and a lambda, then wraps asynchronous work in @Trace(async = true) and uses a token to link the work to the request thread. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_wrap\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamWrap(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> InstrumentedCallable.instrumentCallable(token, () -> requestItem(id))) .map(c -> c.call()) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire(); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_wrap\", results); } Copy",

Description This call records one or more custom attributes (a key/value tuple attached to your transaction). The call name is add_custom_parameters because \"custom attributes\" were previously called \"custom parameters\". Attributes may be found in APM if the transaction is associated with an error or if a transaction trace is generated for that transaction. Attributes can also be found and queried in New Relic One. Important Before you create custom attributes, review our list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Parameters Parameter Description items list Required. Each item in the list must be a tuple, with the first element being a key, and the second its value. Each key is a string representing the name of an attribute, and each corresponding value is the value to add to the current transaction for this attribute. Values can be int, float, string, or boolean. Only the first 255 characters are retained for both keys and values. Return values Returns True if all attributes were added successfully. Examples Adding custom parameters to background task An example of adding custom parameters to a background task: @newrelic.agent.background_task() def send_request(): response = requests.get(\"http://example.com\") newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameters( [(\"url_path_status_code\", response.status_code)] ) Copy Using custom parameters to troubleshoot You can also use custom parameters to troubleshoot performance issues. For example, you might see occasional slow response times from a pool of memcache instances, but you don't know what instance is causing the problem. You might add an attribute to the transaction indicating the server, like so: # Set server_ip to be the current server processing the transaction newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameters([ (\"memcache_query_frontend_lookup\", \"server_ip\") ]) Copy",

This also includes a summary of the Python agent configuration settings that have been deprecated with the release of agent attributes. Configuration settings Use the following destination settings to open or close the destination to any attribute collection: attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless of how this configuration setting is set. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this configuration setting is set. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this configuration setting is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: False Turns on or turns off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data that gets sent to the PageView destination. If attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to browser monitoring regardless of how this configuration setting is set. Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude settings to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: attributes.include Type: Space-Separated List of Strings Default: (none) If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent. attributes.exclude Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) All attribute keys in this list will not be sent. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) All attribute keys in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. error_collector.attributes.include Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent in traced errors. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) All attribute keys in this list will not be sent in traced errors. transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent in transaction events. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) All attribute keys in this list will not be sent in transaction events. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent in page views. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. Attribute rules The agent follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination: Root level takes precedence for enabled. The attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = false attributes.include = foo bar transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, baz Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: foo, bar, baz Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. The YOUR_DESTINATION.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false attributes.include = one two transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = true attributes.exclude = baz Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, baz Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: baz Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = true attributes.include = foo bar attributes.exclude = nerd bar Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, nerd Keys included: foo Keys excluded: nerd, bar Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case-sensitive. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = true attributes.exclude = username UsErNaMe Copy Example output: Keys passed in: username, Username, USERNAME, UsErNaMe, userNAME Keys included: Username, USERNAME, userNAME Keys excluded: username, UsErNaMe Copy Use \\* for wildcards. You can use an asterisk * at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = true attributes.include = custom* attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = true attributes.include = request.parameters.foo attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: attributes.include = foo transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated configuration settings The following configuration settings have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these settings when upgrading your Python agent. Deprecated setting New setting capture_params attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent. Add request.parameters.* to the attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters.

This also includes a summary of the Python agent configuration settings that have been deprecated with the release of agent attributes. Configuration settings Use the following destination settings to open or close the destination to any attribute collection: attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless of how this configuration setting is set. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this configuration setting is set. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this configuration setting is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: False Turns on or turns off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data that gets sent to the PageView destination. If attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to browser monitoring regardless of how this configuration setting is set. Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude settings to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: attributes.include Type: Space-Separated List of Strings Default: (none) If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent. attributes.exclude Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) All attribute keys in this list will not be sent. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) All attribute keys in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. error_collector.attributes.include Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent in traced errors. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) All attribute keys in this list will not be sent in traced errors. transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent in transaction events. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) All attribute keys in this list will not be sent in transaction events. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent in page views. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. Attribute rules The agent follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination: Root level takes precedence for enabled. The attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = false attributes.include = foo bar transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, baz Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: foo, bar, baz Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. The YOUR_DESTINATION.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false attributes.include = one two transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = true attributes.exclude = baz Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, baz Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: baz Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = true attributes.include = foo bar attributes.exclude = nerd bar Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, nerd Keys included: foo Keys excluded: nerd, bar Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case-sensitive. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = true attributes.exclude = username UsErNaMe Copy Example output: Keys passed in: username, Username, USERNAME, UsErNaMe, userNAME Keys included: Username, USERNAME, userNAME Keys excluded: username, UsErNaMe Copy Use \\* for wildcards. You can use an asterisk * at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = true attributes.include = custom* attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = true attributes.include = request.parameters.foo attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: attributes.include = foo transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated configuration settings The following configuration settings have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these settings when upgrading your Python agent. Deprecated setting New setting capture_params attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent.

Description This call records one or more custom attributes (a key/value tuple attached to your transaction). The call name is add_custom_parameters because \"custom attributes\" were previously called \"custom parameters\". Attributes may be found in APM if the transaction is associated with an error or if a transaction trace is generated for that transaction. Attributes can also be found and queried in New Relic One. Important Before you create custom attributes, review our list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Parameters Parameter Description items list Required. Each item in the list must be a tuple, with the first element being a key, and the second its value. Each key is a string representing the name of an attribute, and each corresponding value is the value to add to the current transaction for this attribute. Values can be int, float, string, or boolean. Only the first 255 characters are retained for both keys and values. Return values Returns True if all attributes were added successfully. Examples Adding custom parameters to background task An example of adding custom parameters to a background task: @newrelic.agent.background_task() def send_request(): response = requests.get(\"http://example.com\") newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameters( [(\"url_path_status_code\", response.status_code)] ) Copy Using custom parameters to troubleshoot You can also use custom parameters to troubleshoot performance issues. For example, you might see occasional slow response times from a pool of memcache instances, but you don't know what instance is causing the problem. You might add an attribute to the transaction indicating the server, like so: # Set server_ip to be the current server processing the transaction newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameters([ (\"memcache_query_frontend_lookup\", \"server_ip\") ]) Copy",

      "body": "The Python agent admin script is used during the installation process. When the Python agent package is installed, the newrelic-admin script is also installed into the bin directory of the Python installation or virtual environment. This document gives more in-depth detail about these uses of the admin script: Generating the initial agent configuration file Validating your config file Testing the connection to New Relic Wrapping startup of standalone Python web applications Subcommand structure To execute subcommands, provide the name of the subcommand as the first argument to the newrelic-admin script. Then add any options after the name of the subcommand. For example: newrelic-admin help Copy help < command> When executed with no further arguments, this provides a listing of all accepted subcommands: $ newrelic-admin help Usage: newrelic-admin command [options] Type 'newrelic-admin help <command>' for help on any of the commands listed in this document. To view additional details about a subcommand, run the help command with the subcommand and any of its options. For example: $ newrelic-admin help generate-config Usage: newrelic-admin generate-config license_key [output_file] Generates a sample agent configuration file for <license_key> Copy generate-config license_key [ output_file] Generates a sample agent configuration file. The license_key option is your New Relic license key. By default the sample configuration file will be directed to standard output and be displayed on your screen. To capture the output, you can instead save it to a file by giving the name of the file as the output_file option. When the sample agent configuration file is generated, only the license key option in the file is updated. You should still edit the file and make changes to app_name and log_file options as appropriate. For more information, see Python agent installation. If you cannot run the generate-config command to produce the initial agent configuration file, you can download a sample configuration file from download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/newrelic.ini. validate-config config_file [ log_file] Validates the syntax of an agent configuration file given by the config_file option. This might be the agent configuration generated by generate-config and subsequently edited, or an agent configuration file created by downloading the sample configuration file from the download site. As well as validating the syntax of the configuration file, using the license_key contained in the agent configuration file to identify your account, will also test whether a connection can be made to the our servers. This subcommand can therefore be used to ensure that DNS is available for resolving the hostname of the our data collector host and that there is network connectivity available and that no firewall is blocking access. In connecting to the our servers, the test will create an application under your account called Python Agent Test. Into this application a small amount of simulated web transaction data and errors will be reported. After a period of time this application in your account will be able to be deleted from the Applications list if desired. When this test is run, a log file will be created in the location: /tmp/python-agent-test.log Copy If you need to override this location you can supply the log_file option. To have what would be written to the log file be displayed to your screen, you can use stdout or stderr as the value passed as the log_file option. When using a hosting service such as Heroku where an agent configuration file wouldn't normally be used, this subcommand can still be used to test the connection to us. For Heroku the license key information is defined in an environment variable automatically setup by Heroku when you add the New Relic addon to your Heroku instance. In this case where an environment variable is used to define the license key, to run the connectivity test, pass the value - for the config_file option in place of the path to the agent configuration file. So, to run the command on your Heroku instance you would use: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy Note that we have supplied stdout for the log file in this case, else it would be necessary to separately retrieve the log file generated. It is recommended that when setting up the Python agent for the first time, or even perhaps on a new host, that this subcommand be used to test whether data can be reported okay. For more information, see Testing the Python agent. run-program ... Executes the command line for a Python web application given as ... but forces the initialization of the agent automatically at startup. This is a shortcut method for starting up a Python web application without needing to manually make changes to the web application to add code to specifically initialize the Python agent. It can be used in any situation where a Python web framework or WSGI server is used where instrumentation is being automatically added to wrap the WSGI application entry point. In other words, in situations where only the agent initialization code needed to be added. Agent configuration when using this method can be provided in two different ways. If using a complete agent configuration file then the location of that configuration can be provided by the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you were using gunicorn for example, you could say: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn wsgi:application Copy OR NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini export NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn wsgi:application Copy When specifying the location of the configuration file using the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable, the following additional environment variables can be set to customize how the configuration file is processed. NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT: The name of a specific deployment environment. When specified, additional override configuration will be read from a separate deployment section within the configuration file. The section of the configuration file for a specific deployment environment should be named as newrelic:environment where environment is replaced with the name being specified by this environment variable In place of a complete agent configuration file, you can also set environment variables providing only the key agent configuration information. The environment variables which can be set in this case are: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY - Your New Relic license key. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME - The name of the application you wish to report data against in the UI. If not defined, this defaults to Python Application. NEW_RELIC_LOG - The path to a file to be used for the agent log. If not defined then no logging will occur. Can also be set to stdout or stderr to have logging go to standard output or standard error for process. NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL - The level at which logging will be output by the agent. If not defined then defaults to info. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: critical, error, warning, info and debug. Individual environment variables are used when hosting your application on Heroku. The environment variables will be set automatically as appropriate by the Heroku environment when you add the New Relic addon. It is therefore not necessary when using Heroku to set any of the above environment variables when using the newrelic-admin command with this option from your Procfile. Note that the wrapped program must be using the same Python installation or virtual environment as that which the Python agent package and the newrelic-admin script was installed into. If this is not the case then the wrapper script will have no affect and you may even encounter an error on startup of the Python interpreter due to the newrelic Python package not being able to be found. If using sudo to startup your WSGI application as another user, be aware that the default sudo configuration will generally be such that user environment variables from the shell in which sudo is run will be ignored. In this case you would need to change the sudoers configuration to allow passing of the specific environment variables. Alternatively, create a shell script which sets the environment variables and runs your WSGI application under newrelic-admin. To start up your WSGI application as a different user, then run sudo on that script rather than directly on your WSGI application. The use of an additional wrapper script to set the environment variables and run your WSGI application under newrelic-admin may also be required when using supervisord if any issues are encountered with environment variable settings within the supervisord configuration not being passed through correctly. run-python ... Executes the python executable from the Python installation or virtual environment that newrelic-admin is installed into with the arguments given as ... but forces the initialization of the agent automatically at startup. This is a shortcut method for starting up a Python web application without needing to manually make changes to the web application to add code to specifically initialize the Python agent. It can be used in any situation where a Python web framework or WSGI server is used where instrumentation is being automatically added to wrap the WSGI application entry point. In other words, in situations where only the agent initialization code needed to be added. As for run-program subcommand above, environment variables are used to configure the Python agent. If you were using python executable directly for example, you could say: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-python wsgi.py Copy OR NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini export NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE newrelic-admin run-python wsgi.py Copy license-key config_file [ log_file] Outputs the license key which will be used. This can be used in any startup scripts prior to starting up of the actual WSGI application to log the license key for the purpose of verifying that the correct value is being used. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin license-key newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting the license key using environment variables, use - as the name of the configuration file: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR-LICENSE-KEY' export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY newrelic-admin license-key - Copy Output will be in the form: license_key = 'YOUR-LICENSE-KEY' Copy If no license key was found in the agent configuration file or picked up from user environment variables, the output will be: license_key = None Copy network-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the network configuration which will be used. This can be used in any startup scripts prior to starting up of the actual WSGI application to log the network configuration for the purpose of verifying that the correct values are being used. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin network-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting any proxy information using environment variables, use - as the name of the configuration file: NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST=proxy.example.com export NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT=8888 export NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT newrelic-admin network-config - Copy Output will be in the form: host = 'collector.newrelic.com' port = 0 proxy_host = 'proxy.example.com' proxy_port = 8888 proxy_user = None proxy_pass = None ssl = True Copy A value of 0 for port indicates that the port number, either 80 or 443, will be automatically selected based on whether an SSL connection is being used to communicate with our data collector. local-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the local agent configuration based on built-in defaults, environment variables, and any agent configuration file. This information may be requested by our technical support when trying to debug any agent startup issues. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin local-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting any settings using environment variables, you can use - as the name of the configuration file: newrelic-admin local-config - Copy server-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the full configuration for a specific application. This will be the local agent configuration, overridden by any server-side configuration for the specific application. This information may be requested by our technical support when trying to debug any agent startup issues. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin server-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If changing any settings using environment variables, you can use - as the name of the configuration file: newrelic-admin server-config - Copy In order to obtain the server-side configuration, this script will force agent registration for the specific application defined by the configuration. If that application does not already appear in the user interface for APM, an entry for it will be created, but no metric data will be reported against it. record-deploy config_file description This is a wrapper around the New Relic REST API to record deployments for your application. You can also record deployments directly via the REST API. To use the command: Add your API key in the agent configuration file (newrelic.ini) by adding a line similar to the following in the [newrelic] section: api_key=substitute-your-api-key-here Copy Call the newrelic-admin command from the command line. (Do not add it to your config file.) using the following subcommand structure: newrelic-admin record-deploy config_file description [revision changelog user] Copy This subcommand has two required arguments: config_file: Path to the config file name description: Text to describe or identify the deployment; for example, the Git commit comments There are also three optional arguments: revision: Identifies a specific revision being deployed changelog: Provides a detailed log of what changes were made user: Identifies the person responsible for the deployment",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

This document gives more in-depth detail about these uses of the admin script: Generating the initial agent configuration file Validating your config file Testing the connection to New Relic Wrapping startup of standalone Python web applications Subcommand structure To execute subcommands, provide the name of the subcommand as the first argument to the newrelic-admin script. Then add any options after the name of the subcommand. For example: newrelic-admin help Copy help < command> When executed with no further arguments, this provides a listing of all accepted subcommands: $ newrelic-admin help Usage: newrelic-admin command [options] Type 'newrelic-admin help <command>' for help on any of the commands listed in this document. To view additional details about a subcommand, run the help command with the subcommand and any of its options. For example: $ newrelic-admin help generate-config Usage: newrelic-admin generate-config license_key [output_file] Generates a sample agent configuration file for <license_key> Copy generate-config license_key [ output_file] Generates a sample agent configuration file. The license_key option is your New Relic license key. By default the sample configuration file will be directed to standard output and be displayed on your screen. To capture the output, you can instead save it to a file by giving the name of the file as the output_file option. When the sample agent configuration file is generated, only the license key option in the file is updated. You should still edit the file and make changes to app_name and log_file options as appropriate. For more information, see Python agent installation. If you cannot run the generate-config command to produce the initial agent configuration file, you can download a sample configuration file from download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/newrelic.ini. validate-config config_file [ log_file] Validates the syntax of an agent configuration file given by the config_file option. This might be the agent configuration generated by generate-config and subsequently edited, or an agent configuration file created by downloading the sample configuration file from the download site. As well as validating the syntax of the configuration file, using the license_key contained in the agent configuration file to identify your account, will also test whether a connection can be made to the our servers. This subcommand can therefore be used to ensure that DNS is available for resolving the hostname of the our data collector host and that there is network connectivity available and that no firewall is blocking access. In connecting to the our servers, the test will create an application under your account called Python Agent Test. Into this application a small amount of simulated web transaction data and errors will be reported. After a period of time this application in your account will be able to be deleted from the Applications list if desired. When this test is run, a log file will be created in the location: /tmp/python-agent-test.log Copy If you need to override this location you can supply the log_file option. To have what would be written to the log file be displayed to your screen, you can use stdout or stderr as the value passed as the log_file option. When using a hosting service such as Heroku where an agent configuration file wouldn't normally be used, this subcommand can still be used to test the connection to us. For Heroku the license key information is defined in an environment variable automatically setup by Heroku when you add the New Relic addon to your Heroku instance. In this case where an environment variable is used to define the license key, to run the connectivity test, pass the value - for the config_file option in place of the path to the agent configuration file. So, to run the command on your Heroku instance you would use: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy Note that we have supplied stdout for the log file in this case, else it would be necessary to separately retrieve the log file generated. It is recommended that when setting up the Python agent for the first time, or even perhaps on a new host, that this subcommand be used to test whether data can be reported okay. For more information, see Testing the Python agent. run-program ... Executes the command line for a Python web application given as ... but forces the initialization of the agent automatically at startup. This is a shortcut method for starting up a Python web application without needing to manually make changes to the web application to add code to specifically initialize the Python agent. It can be used in any situation where a Python web framework or WSGI server is used where instrumentation is being automatically added to wrap the WSGI application entry point. In other words, in situations where only the agent initialization code needed to be added. Agent configuration when using this method can be provided in two different ways. If using a complete agent configuration file then the location of that configuration can be provided by the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you were using gunicorn for example, you could say: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn wsgi:application Copy OR NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini export NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn wsgi:application Copy When specifying the location of the configuration file using the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable, the following additional environment variables can be set to customize how the configuration file is processed. NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT: The name of a specific deployment environment. When specified, additional override configuration will be read from a separate deployment section within the configuration file. The section of the configuration file for a specific deployment environment should be named as newrelic:environment where environment is replaced with the name being specified by this environment variable In place of a complete agent configuration file, you can also set environment variables providing only the key agent configuration information. The environment variables which can be set in this case are: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY - Your New Relic license key. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME - The name of the application you wish to report data against in the UI. If not defined, this defaults to Python Application. NEW_RELIC_LOG - The path to a file to be used for the agent log. If not defined then no logging will occur. Can also be set to stdout or stderr to have logging go to standard output or standard error for process. NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL - The level at which logging will be output by the agent. If not defined then defaults to info. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: critical, error, warning, info and debug. Individual environment variables are used when hosting your application on Heroku. The environment variables will be set automatically as appropriate by the Heroku environment when you add the New Relic addon. It is therefore not necessary when using Heroku to set any of the above environment variables when using the newrelic-admin command with this option from your Procfile. Note that the wrapped program must be using the same Python installation or virtual environment as that which the Python agent package and the newrelic-admin script was installed into. If this is not the case then the wrapper script will have no affect and you may even encounter an error on startup of the Python interpreter due to the newrelic Python package not being able to be found. If using sudo to startup your WSGI application as another user, be aware that the default sudo configuration will generally be such that user environment variables from the shell in which sudo is run will be ignored. In this case you would need to change the sudoers configuration to allow passing of the specific environment variables. Alternatively, create a shell script which sets the environment variables and runs your WSGI application under newrelic-admin. To start up your WSGI application as a different user, then run sudo on that script rather than directly on your WSGI application. The use of an additional wrapper script to set the environment variables and run your WSGI application under newrelic-admin may also be required when using supervisord if any issues are encountered with environment variable settings within the supervisord configuration not being passed through correctly. run-python ... Executes the python executable from the Python installation or virtual environment that newrelic-admin is installed into with the arguments given as ... but forces the initialization of the agent automatically at startup. This is a shortcut method for starting up a Python web application without needing to manually make changes to the web application to add code to specifically initialize the Python agent. It can be used in any situation where a Python web framework or WSGI server is used where instrumentation is being automatically added to wrap the WSGI application entry point. In other words, in situations where only the agent initialization code needed to be added. As for run-program subcommand above, environment variables are used to configure the Python agent. If you were using python executable directly for example, you could say: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-python wsgi.py Copy OR NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini export NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE newrelic-admin run-python wsgi.py Copy license-key config_file [ log_file] Outputs the license key which will be used. This can be used in any startup scripts prior to starting up of the actual WSGI application to log the license key for the purpose of verifying that the correct value is being used. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin license-key newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting the license key using environment variables, use - as the name of the configuration file: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR-LICENSE-KEY' export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY newrelic-admin license-key - Copy Output will be in the form: license_key = 'YOUR-LICENSE-KEY' Copy If no license key was found in the agent configuration file or picked up from user environment variables, the output will be: license_key = None Copy network-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the network configuration which will be used. This can be used in any startup scripts prior to starting up of the actual WSGI application to log the network configuration for the purpose of verifying that the correct values are being used. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin network-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting any proxy information using environment variables, use - as the name of the configuration file: NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST=proxy.example.com export NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT=8888 export NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT newrelic-admin network-config - Copy Output will be in the form: host = 'collector.newrelic.com' port = 0 proxy_host = 'proxy.example.com' proxy_port = 8888 proxy_user = None proxy_pass = None ssl = True Copy A value of 0 for port indicates that the port number, either 80 or 443, will be automatically selected based on whether an SSL connection is being used to communicate with our data collector. local-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the local agent configuration based on built-in defaults, environment variables, and any agent configuration file. This information may be requested by our technical support when trying to debug any agent startup issues. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin local-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting any settings using environment variables, you can use - as the name of the configuration file: newrelic-admin local-config - Copy server-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the full configuration for a specific application. This will be the local agent configuration, overridden by any server-side configuration for the specific application. This information may be requested by our technical support when trying to debug any agent startup issues. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin server-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If changing any settings using environment variables, you can use - as the name of the configuration file: newrelic-admin server-config - Copy In order to obtain the server-side configuration, this script will force agent registration for the specific application defined by the configuration. If that application does not already appear in the user interface for APM, an entry for it will be created, but no metric data will be reported against it. record-deploy config_file description This is a wrapper around the New Relic REST API to record deployments for your application. You can also record deployments directly via the REST API. To use the command: Add your API key in the agent configuration file (newrelic.ini) by adding a line similar to the following in the [newrelic] section: api_key=substitute-your-api-key-here Copy Call the newrelic-admin command from the command line. (Do not add it to your config file.) using the following subcommand structure: newrelic-admin record-deploy config_file description [revision changelog user] Copy This subcommand has two required arguments: config_file: Path to the config file name description: Text to describe or identify the deployment; for example, the Git commit comments There are also three optional arguments: revision: Identifies a specific revision being deployed changelog: Provides a detailed log of what changes were made user: Identifies the person responsible for the deployment",

      "body": "Syntax newrelic.agent.application_settings(name=None) Copy Returns an application settings object. Description This returns a reference to the application settings object. The global_settings object contains settings in the configuration file and environment variables; this application_settings object additionally includes configuration changes set server-side via the New Relic UI. The returned settings are nested, hierarchical objects and the setting names match the names in the agent configuration file. The main reason to expose the application settings is if you want your instrumentation to reference the agent-specific local configuration and not what's set server-side. If the name value is not set, the call uses the application name specified in the agent config file or via the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable. If the application hasn't been registered with the data collector when this call is made, it returns the value None. When a call is successfully made and returns values, it will reflect the values of any local configuration overlaid with the server-side configuration for that application obtained during registration. Important Do not make any changes to the application settings object. Do not cache the settings object because it will be invalidated and replaced if a server-side config change causes the agent to re-register the application with the data collector. Parameters Parameter Description name string Optional. The name of the application. If not set, the name matches the name set in the Python agent configuration for that application. Return values Returns an application settings object. The object itself does not present any public API; some other calls require it to be passed. Examples Using an IF statement You might want to check the configuration settings to determine what custom instrumentation to implement. Here's an example of using an if statement with the app settings object: settings = newrelic.agent.application_settings() if settings and settings.error_collector.enabled: ... Copy Passing results into dict If you are debugging or logging and require the global settings as a traditional Python dictionary object, you can pass the result into a dict. For example: settings_dict = dict(newrelic.agent.application_settings()) for name, value in settings_dict.items(): print name, value Copy Each name will be the full dotted path for that setting.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Tip To use Python or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "You can extend the Python agent's monitoring to trace time spent in additional functions or methods of classes by modifying your configuration file. This form of custom instrumentation is simpler to implement than API calls, and does not require you to modify your code. However, for more complex needs, you may need to implement Python instrumentation by API. Listing functions in the configuration file To extend instrumentation to designated functions and class methods, add them to the transaction_tracer.function_trace setting within the newrelic section of the agent configuration file. The identifier for a function should have the form module:function and that of a class method module:class.function. Using dumbdbm In this example, you use the Python dumbdbm module and want to instrument the time it took to open a database, and then to write that database back to a file. In this case you would use: transaction_tracer.function_trace = dumbdbm:open dumbdbm:_Database._commit Copy To list more than one item, use either of these methods: One line: Separate each item with a space. Multiple lines: Follow the ini file convention to indent the subsequent lines. When data is reported for the instrumented function, the metric will have a name in the form Function/module:function or Function/module:class.function. In the performance breakdown for a transaction, the category will show as Function and the segment will be module:function or module:class.function. For slow transaction traces, only the segment name appears. Note that where a function is actually returning a generator, only the time spent in returning the generator will be recorded and not the consumption of the values from the generator. Restrictions on wrapping extension APIs When wrapping functions by listing them in the agent configuration file, you cannot designate class methods this way when the method is a member of a class which is implemented in C code by a C extension module. This is because it is not possible to modify the method table of a type implemented using the Python C API. Overriding the reported function name When using the transaction_tracer.function_trace setting in the agent configuration file, the name of the function will be used in the metric name, with it being classified as a Function. If it is necessary to override what function name may be used in the metric name or classify it differently, then an alternate means of defining the function trace in the configuration file can be used. The equivalent for: transaction_tracer.function_trace = dumbdbm:open dumbdbm:_Database._commit Copy would be to create two new configuration sections in the agent configuration file, one for each function to be traced: [function-trace:dumbdbm-1] enabled = true function = dumbdbm:open name = dumbdbm:open group = Function [function-trace:dumbdbm-2] enabled = true function = dumbdbm:_Database._commit name = dumbdbm:_Database._commit group = Function Copy The ini file section name should start with function-trace:. The name component that follows that prefix can be anything but should be unique across all function trace sections in the configuration file. The group and name settings can be overridden as necessary to arrive at the desired metric name. The enabled setting defaults to false and needs to be set to true to enable the function trace. Instrument with the API For simple custom instrumentation purposes, the config file method works well. For more precise and customized instrumentation and agent behavior adjustments, you will want to use the Python agent API.",

Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",
