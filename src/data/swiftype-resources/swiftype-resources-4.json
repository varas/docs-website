      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use any of the following methods to add the New Relic .NET agent to your Azure-deployed web app. The best option depends on your role, environment, deployments, etc. For example: For operations teams that need to monitor the app, the easiest and most reliable option is to use the publicly maintained Azure site extension. Note: Azure Site Extensions are only currently available for Windows App Service Resources. Install using the Azure Site Extension For developer teams, or anyone needing to deploy the agent on a Linux App Service Resource, installing via nuget is the best option: Install using NuGet (.NET Framework) Install using NuGet (.NET Core) In order to monitor non-web apps (including WebJobs), or ASP.NET Core apps targeting .NET Framework, you must explicitly enable the agent for that application's .exe process via one of these two methods: Enable via placement of local newrelic.config file. Enable via application config file In addition, WebJobs may need custom instrumentation for transactions to appear in APM, and additional configuration if they run for less than one minute. Disable Application Insights Both New Relic's .NET agent and Microsoft Application Insights rely on the CLR Profiler, but only one may be active at a time. You must disable Application Insights in order for the .NET agent to function properly. For more information, see our Application Insights troubleshooting procedures. Install using the New Relic Azure Site Extension (Windows Only) To install the .NET agent for an Azure Web App using the New Relic Azure Site Extension: Shut down your web application before installing the New Relic Azure Site Extension. Add the site extension: Navigate to http://[yoursitename].scm.azurewebsites.net, then select Site extensions > Gallery. Select the plus icon next to the New Relic site extension. In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app to use the new version of the agent. Install using NuGet (.NET Framework) The NuGet installation method packages the New Relic Agent with your application so that it is available to the Azure Web App Host. The NuGet packages in this procedure support only the old packages.config. They do not support the current PackageReference format. For more information, see Microsoft's package reference documentation. For multi-project solutions, make sure you have selected the correct project (for example, a specific web app project) before installing the NuGet package. If you are upgrading the .NET Framework agent using NuGet, any changes you made in the newrelic.config will be overwritten. To preserve any changes, save your newrelic.config outside of your project, then restore it after upgrading. To install the .NET agent on an Azure Web App using NuGet: In the Azure portal, verify your Azure Platform (32-bit or 64-bit): From the Azure sidebar menu, select App Services > Your Application > Settings > Configuration > General settings. Open your application in Visual Studio, and install the New Relic NuGet package by running the appropriate command from the Package manager console: 32-bit: Install-Package NewRelic.Azure.WebSites 64-bit: Install-Package NewRelic.Azure.WebSites.x64 Publish your application. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Settings > Configuration. From Configuration, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Key Value COR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 COR_PROFILER {71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} COR_PROFILER_PATH D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll NEWRELIC_HOME D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app. Install using NuGet (.NET Core) The NuGet installation method packages the New Relic Agent with your application so that it is available to the Azure Web App Host. New Relic .NET Core agent supports Linux and Windows applications on Azure App Services. The installation process for Azure App Services differs from the .NET Core agent installation procedures for Linux and Windows. To install the .NET agent on an Azure Web App using NuGet: Install the NewRelic.Agent NuGet package. Modify the log node by adding a directory attribute to your newrelic.config file (Note: If Visual Studio prevents you from editing the newrelic.config file that was added to your project by NuGet then you will need to make a local copy of this in your application): Log file configuration for Windows &lt;log directory=\"D:\\Home\\LogFiles\\NewRelic\" level=\"info\"&gt;&lt;/log&gt; Copy Log file configuration for Linux &lt;log directory=\"/home/LogFiles/NewRelic\" level=\"info\"&gt;&lt;/log&gt; Copy Publish your application. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Settings > Configuration. From Configuration, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Environment variables for Windows Key Value CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 CORECLR_PROFILER {36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH_32 D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\x86\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH_64 D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic Environment variables for Linux Key Value CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 CORECLR_PROFILER {36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH /home/site/wwwroot/newrelic/libNewRelicProfiler.so CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME /home/site/wwwroot/newrelic NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY /home/LogFiles/NewRelic In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app. Add New Relic app settings to Azure App Services To add your app settings: Make sure you have your license key before adding the New Relic .NET agent's app settings. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Configuration > Application settings. From Application settings, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Key Value NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY YOUR_LICENSE_KEY NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME YOUR_APP_NAME Save and restart your web app. Setting the license key and app name with Application settings will override the newrelic.config. To verify your app's environment variables in your app's Kudu diagnostic console, go to Environment > Environment variables. For example: https://myappname.scm.azurewebsites.net/Env.cshtml#envVariables Copy View your app's performance Your application must receive traffic in order for you to view its performance in New Relic. You may need to wait a few minutes for data to start appearing. If no data appears, see the troubleshooting procedures for Azure Web Apps. To view your app's performance in New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). The APM Summary page automatically appears. You can also view detailed information about errors, database and instance performance issues, and more. If you created your New Relic app prior to October 2017, you can use the Azure portal to select the New Relic account blade. You will be automatically logged in with SAML Single Sign-on (SSO) to APM. You can also view your application's error rate and throughput data in the Azure portal by going to New Relic Accounts > (select your app). Troubleshooting If no data appears after installing the agent, generating traffic for your app, and waiting a few minutes, try these troubleshooting tips: Make sure that all files in the newrelic directory at the root of your app got published to Azure. Make sure the environment variables are set correctly. Make sure Microsoft Application Insights is not installed and configured on the application. For more information, see the Application Insights troubleshooting procedures. Refer to additional Azure troubleshooting procedures as applicable.",

The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager.

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header.

MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings.

Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to New Relic APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in New Relic APM and New Relic Insights. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each New Relic APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to New Relic APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in New Relic APM and New Relic Insights. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each New Relic APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to New Relic APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in New Relic APM and New Relic Insights. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each New Relic APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude properties to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: newrelic.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic. newrelic.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic Browser in page views. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.span_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in span events. newrelic.span_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

      "body": "Learn about properties to enable or disable attributes, and the rules that New Relic uses when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. This also includes a summary of the PHP agent properties that have been deprecated with the release of New Relic agent attributes. Properties Use the following destination properties to open or close the destination to any attribute collection: newrelic.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes in all destinations. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: False Turns on or turns off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data that gets attached to page view events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to browser monitoring regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for traced errors. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for Span data. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to spans regardless of how this property is set. Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude properties to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: newrelic.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic. newrelic.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic Browser in page views. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.span_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in span events. newrelic.span_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

This also includes a summary of the PHP agent properties that have been deprecated with the release of New Relic agent attributes. Properties Use the following destination properties to open or close the destination to any attribute collection: newrelic.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes in all destinations. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: False Turns on or turns off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data that gets attached to page view events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to browser monitoring regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for traced errors. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for Span data. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to spans regardless of how this property is set. Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude properties to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: newrelic.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic. newrelic.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic Browser in page views. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.span_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in span events. newrelic.span_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

      "body": "Learn about properties to enable or disable attributes, and the rules that New Relic uses when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. This also includes a summary of the PHP agent properties that have been deprecated with the release of New Relic agent attributes. Properties Use the following destination properties to open or close the destination to any attribute collection: newrelic.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes in all destinations. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: False Turns on or turns off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data that gets attached to page view events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to browser monitoring regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for traced errors. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for Span data. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to spans regardless of how this property is set. Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude properties to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: newrelic.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic. newrelic.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic Browser in page views. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.span_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in span events. newrelic.span_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "With the Ruby agent, you can add New Relic Browser instrumentation to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable Browser in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the Browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Ruby agent. Requirements In order to use New Relic Browser with your Ruby agent, make sure you meet these requirements: New Relic Ruby agent (version 3.0.1 or higher) For automatic instrumentation: Rails 2.3 or higher For manual instrumentation: Rails 2.0 to 2.2 Use auto-instrumentation Automatic instrumentation works with Rack, and requires Rails 2.3 or higher. Configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with end user monitoring scripts, by adding or editing the following flag in newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: true Copy This is the simplest way to monitor end users. The Ruby agent examines each page from your application and automatically injects the Browser JavaScript in the header. Auto-instrumentation works for environments that support Rack. For performance reasons the agent scans only the first 50k of your application's response for the header instrumentation point. In cases where a X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present and the <head> tag is longer than 50k, auto-instrumentation will fail gracefully. Auto-instrumentation will look for an X-UA-Compatible meta tag and insert the JavaScript directly after it. If the auto-instrumentation cannot find an X-UA-Compatible meta tag, it will insert after the opening head tag, and failing that it will insert after the opening body tag. If any of these tags are wrapped in conditionals or comments, the automatic instrumentation will likely fail. If auto-instrumentation fails to correctly instrument your application’s pages, then you must manually instrument via agent API. Manually instrument via agent API If you are using Rails 2.1 to 2.2 or cannot use auto-instrumentation, you can still set up end user monitoring manually by including appropriate scripts in your pages. Use the New Relic Ruby agent's API to generate the script to be inserted into your pages. For example, to modify your application's template to call the agent, use: <head> <%= ::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header rescue \"\" %> ... existing template code ... </head> Copy CSP Nonce support CSP Nonce usage in our browser instrumentation is supported in version 7.1.0+ of the Ruby agent. To use a nonce with the Browser instrumentation, you must disable browser monitoring auto instrumentation and use the manual instrumentation via the agent API. You may now pass a nonce as an argument into the API method to allow the agent to insert the nonce into the browser instrumentation. For example, NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header(nonce). Troubleshooting If you do not see any browser data being reported, view the HTML source and confirm two blocks of script similar to this in your HTML head: <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});...</script> Copy If these are not present, check the auto-instrumentation settings or the placement of manual instrumentation in your template files. In versions of the Ruby agent prior to 3.7.0, <%=::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_footer rescue \"\" %> also needed to be called as close to the bottom of the document as possible. With 3.7.0, all the required script is included by browser_timing_header. browser_timing_footer returns an empty string for compatibility. Disable auto-instrumentation The default value of auto-instrument is true (even when unspecified). To disable auto-instrumentation, set this flag to false. To disable auto-instrumentation only for certain controllers or controller actions, use newrelic_ignore_enduser. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected by this call.",

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "With the Ruby agent, you can add New Relic Browser instrumentation to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable Browser in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the Browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Ruby agent. Requirements In order to use New Relic Browser with your Ruby agent, make sure you meet these requirements: New Relic Ruby agent (version 3.0.1 or higher) For automatic instrumentation: Rails 2.3 or higher For manual instrumentation: Rails 2.0 to 2.2 Use auto-instrumentation Automatic instrumentation works with Rack, and requires Rails 2.3 or higher. Configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with end user monitoring scripts, by adding or editing the following flag in newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: true Copy This is the simplest way to monitor end users. The Ruby agent examines each page from your application and automatically injects the Browser JavaScript in the header. Auto-instrumentation works for environments that support Rack. For performance reasons the agent scans only the first 50k of your application's response for the header instrumentation point. In cases where a X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present and the <head> tag is longer than 50k, auto-instrumentation will fail gracefully. Auto-instrumentation will look for an X-UA-Compatible meta tag and insert the JavaScript directly after it. If the auto-instrumentation cannot find an X-UA-Compatible meta tag, it will insert after the opening head tag, and failing that it will insert after the opening body tag. If any of these tags are wrapped in conditionals or comments, the automatic instrumentation will likely fail. If auto-instrumentation fails to correctly instrument your application’s pages, then you must manually instrument via agent API. Manually instrument via agent API If you are using Rails 2.1 to 2.2 or cannot use auto-instrumentation, you can still set up end user monitoring manually by including appropriate scripts in your pages. Use the New Relic Ruby agent's API to generate the script to be inserted into your pages. For example, to modify your application's template to call the agent, use: <head> <%= ::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header rescue \"\" %> ... existing template code ... </head> Copy CSP Nonce support CSP Nonce usage in our browser instrumentation is supported in version 7.1.0+ of the Ruby agent. To use a nonce with the Browser instrumentation, you must disable browser monitoring auto instrumentation and use the manual instrumentation via the agent API. You may now pass a nonce as an argument into the API method to allow the agent to insert the nonce into the browser instrumentation. For example, NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header(nonce). Troubleshooting If you do not see any browser data being reported, view the HTML source and confirm two blocks of script similar to this in your HTML head: <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});...</script> Copy If these are not present, check the auto-instrumentation settings or the placement of manual instrumentation in your template files. In versions of the Ruby agent prior to 3.7.0, <%=::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_footer rescue \"\" %> also needed to be called as close to the bottom of the document as possible. With 3.7.0, all the required script is included by browser_timing_header. browser_timing_footer returns an empty string for compatibility. Disable auto-instrumentation The default value of auto-instrument is true (even when unspecified). To disable auto-instrumentation, set this flag to false. To disable auto-instrumentation only for certain controllers or controller actions, use newrelic_ignore_enduser. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected by this call.",

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

When these metrics are collected, a Drupal tab appears in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select a Drupal app).

It is enabled by default (in versions 3.0 or higher), and can be disabled with: newrelic.framework.drupal.modules = 0 Copy Though this setting uses the word \"modules,\" it controls the collection of all Drupal metrics: modules, views, and hooks. Metrics The PHP agent collects metrics for the following: Modules: Versions 2.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal module. In versions 3.5 or higher, time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. In previous versions, time was calculated from functions from a file with the \".module\" extension where the file name and function prefix were a match. Hooks: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. Views: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within a view's view::execute method. Drupal and Browser instrumentation In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the New Relic Browser JavaScript is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Cron tasks Drupal supports periodically executing tasks to perform routine maintenance or similar work on behalf of installed Drupal modules. These tasks can be run without any manual involvement beyond the initial configuration. Commonly, these are referred to as cron tasks. Starting in version 4.3, the New Relic PHP agent detects the execution of these tasks and automatically marks them as background transactions regardless of how they were started.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

A WordPress page appears in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select a WordPress app). Configuration You can control which WordPress-specific metrics your app sends to New Relic by using the PHP agent's ini setting newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks. This is enabled by default in versions 5.3 or higher, and it can be disabled with: newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks = false Copy Although this setting uses the word .hooks, it controls all WordPress metrics sent to New Relic, including hooks, plugins, and themes. Metrics The PHP agent receives metrics for the following: Hooks: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions apply_filters, apply_filters_ref_array, do_action, and do_action_ref_array. Plugins and themes: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress plugin and theme. Time is calculated from the dispatch functions for hooks. Integration with New Relic partners By integrating your WordPress application with APM, you can view performance directly from your WordPress app's Administration page. For example, W3 Total Cache is one of New Relic's Connect partners that specializes in WordPress apps. WordPress plugin for browser monitoring Signing up for a New Relic account and adding browser monitoring to your WordPress site is fast and easy with the browser monitoring plugin for WordPress. The plugin and our browser monitoring do not require the special access required to install our PHP agent. This makes them generally compatible with all WordPress hosting providers. In addition, the WordPress plugin is supported by the authors and the WordPress community.

This is enabled by default in versions 5.3 or higher, and it can be disabled with: newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks = false Copy Although this setting uses the word .hooks, it controls all WordPress metrics sent to New Relic, including hooks, plugins, and themes. Metrics The PHP agent receives metrics for the following: Hooks: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions apply_filters, apply_filters_ref_array, do_action, and do_action_ref_array. Plugins and themes: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress plugin and theme. Time is calculated from the dispatch functions for hooks. Integration with New Relic partners By integrating your WordPress application with APM, you can view performance directly from your WordPress app's Administration page. For example, W3 Total Cache is one of New Relic's Connect partners that specializes in WordPress apps. WordPress plugin for browser monitoring Signing up for a New Relic account and adding browser monitoring to your WordPress site is fast and easy with the browser monitoring plugin for WordPress.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

It is enabled by default (in versions 3.0 or higher), and can be disabled with: newrelic.framework.drupal.modules = 0 Copy Though this setting uses the word \"modules,\" it controls the collection of all Drupal metrics: modules, views, and hooks. Metrics The PHP agent collects metrics for the following: Modules: Versions 2.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal module. In versions 3.5 or higher, time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. In previous versions, time was calculated from functions from a file with the \".module\" extension where the file name and function prefix were a match. Hooks: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. Views: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within a view's view::execute method. Drupal and Browser instrumentation In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the New Relic Browser JavaScript is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Cron tasks Drupal supports periodically executing tasks to perform routine maintenance or similar work on behalf of installed Drupal modules. These tasks can be run without any manual involvement beyond the initial configuration. Commonly, these are referred to as cron tasks. Starting in version 4.3, the New Relic PHP agent detects the execution of these tasks and automatically marks them as background transactions regardless of how they were started.

If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the New Relic Browser JavaScript is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Cron tasks Drupal supports periodically executing tasks to perform routine maintenance or similar work on behalf of installed Drupal modules. These tasks can be run without any manual involvement beyond the initial configuration. Commonly, these are referred to as cron tasks.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

Please contact http://support.newrelic.com and report the above error. We have also created a tar file with log files and other system info that can help solve the problem.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector.

Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals.

This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude.

Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully. Examples Record a 100 millisecond response time function example() { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available newrelic_custom_metric(\"Custom/custom-metric-name\", 100.00); } } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw.

Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully.

It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully.

Please contact http://support.newrelic.com and report the above error. We have also created a tar file with log files and other system info that can help solve the problem.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully.

Please contact http://support.newrelic.com and report the above error. We have also created a tar file with log files and other system info that can help solve the problem.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

Copy Failure with the manual install process You used the manual install process with the install utility nrmaninstall.php, or you followed the manual instructions, and then you encountered something similar to this: $ sudo cp ./agent/x86_64/newrelic-20121212.so /usr/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20121212/ cp: /usr/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20121212/newrelic-20121212.so: Operation not permitted $ sudo cp ./daemon/newrelic-daemon.x86_64 /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon cp: /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon: Operation not permitted Copy Solution If necessary, you can install the PHP agent by disabling Apple's System Integrity Protection (SIP). This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully.

Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds.

      "body": "The Python agent default security settings automatically provide security for your data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information we ingest. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...)

Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to...

      "body": "Our Python agent lets you change the default agent behavior agent using configuration options. The only required Python agent configuration setting is the license key. The license key identifies the account where the agent reports application data. Depending on how you are hosting your application, the license key can be provided via a configuration file or an environment variable. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Python agent is via the configuration file, which is generated as part of the standard install process. It is also possible to set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI or by using environment variables. You can also specify some settings on a per-request basis by passing settings with the WSGI request environ dictionary. The Python agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: With the Python agent, per-request options override server-side config. If enabled, server-side config overrides all corresponding values in the agent config file, even if the server-side values are left blank. The agent config file overrides environment variables. Environment variables override the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file Typically you configure your Python agent from a local configuration file on the agent's host system. Supply the path to the config file at startup using one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the path to the config file as the first argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you use the newrelic-admin wrapper script, you must use the environment variable because the wrapper script calls the agent automatically. The configuration file uses a structure similar to Microsoft Windows .ini files. For more information, see the Python ConfigParser module's file format documentation. Tip A sample configuration file is included with the Python agent as newrelic/newrelic.ini. You can also generate one from the newrelic-admin script using the generate-config command, or download a copy from our download repo. Server-side configuration Tip Owner or Admins Server-side configuration allows you to configure certain settings in the New Relic One UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. Important If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the config file that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty string and does not use the agent config file. Environment variables Environment variables allow you to override the defaults for certain core settings. If the equivalent setting is explicitly listed in the agent config file, the config file settings take precedence over the environment variable. Where available, environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. For simple configurations, you can use the environment variables in conjunction with server-side configuration and avoid the agent config file altogether. This is the default setup with Heroku, where installing the New Relic add-on automatically populates the necessary environment variables. Environment variable Configuration setting NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY license_key NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME app_name NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE monitor_mode NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE developer_mode NEW_RELIC_LOG log_file NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL log_level NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY high_security NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME proxy_scheme NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST proxy_host NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT proxy_port NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER proxy_user NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS proxy_pass NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG audit_log_file NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT startup_timeout NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT shutdown_timeout NEW_RELIC_LABELS labels NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME process_host.display_name NEW_RELIC_API_KEY api_key NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH ca_bundle_path NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED distributed_tracing.enabled NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG feature_flag Per-request configuration For certain WSGI servers, you can override the app name and capture attributes settings on a per-request basis. This is possible with WSGI servers where you can define additional key/value pairs that are passed into the per-request WSGI environ dictionary. Set these values with the strings on, off, true, false, 1 and 0. If set from a configuration mechanism implemented using Python code, Python objects evaluating to True or False will also be accepted. Example: Apache/mod_wsgi app name In the Apache/mod_wsgi server, you can use the SetEnv directive to override config settings (optionally inside a Location or Directory block). For example, you could override the app name for a complete virtual host, or for a subset of URLs handled by the WSGI application for that virtual host. In addition to being able to override certain agent configuration settings, you can set other per-request configuration settings with their WSGI environment key: newrelic.set_background_task If set to true, this web transaction will instead be reported as a non-web transaction. newrelic.ignore_transaction If set to true, this web transaction will not be reported. newrelic.suppress_apdex_metric If set to true, no Apdex metric will be generated for this web transaction. newrelic.suppress_transaction_trace If set to true, this web transaction cannot be recorded in a transaction trace. newrelic.disable_browser_autorum If set to true, this disables automatic insertion of the JavaScript header/footer for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). Only applicable if auto-insertion is available for your web framework. Important Using a WSGI middleware to set these values will not work where the Python agent's own WSGI application wrapper was applied at an outer scope. In these cases you must make calls to the agent API to achieve the same outcome. Multiple environment configuration The agent reads its primary configuration from an agent config section called newrelic. You can provide overrides for specific deployment environments (for example, Development, Staging, Production) in additional sections. Preface these sections with [newrelic:environment], where environment is replaced with the name of your environment. To specify that the agent should use an environment-based configuration, use one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the environment name as the second argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT environment variable to the environment name. If no environment is specified, the agent will use the default settings as specified in the newrelic agent config section. The basic structure of the configuration file is: [newrelic] ... default settings [newrelic:development] ... override settings [newrelic:staging] ... override settings [newrelic:production] ... override settings Copy General configuration settings These settings are available in the agent configuration file. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Specifies the license key of your New Relic account. This key associates your app's metrics with your New Relic account. app_name (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Type String Default Python Application Set in Per-request option, config file, environment variable Per-request option newrelic.app_name Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic One UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon ;. Do not put a space before the semicolon, which causes the Python config parser to interpret the name as an embedded comment. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent collects performance data about your app and reports this data to our data collector. developer_mode Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE When true, the agent will instrument your web app, but will not send any actual data. In this offline mode, you will not be billed for an active agent. Use developer mode to test new versions of the agent, or test the agent against third-party packages in a developer environment. Offline mode is not a way of running the APM locally, because the metrics the agent collects are not reported anywhere. log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Sets the name of a log file, which is useful for debugging issues with the agent. This is not set by default, since the agent does not know your web app process's parent user or what directories that process has permission to write to. For detailed information, see Python agent logging. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct, and that the user that your web application runs as can write to the file. Tip Use an absolute path unless you are sure what the working directory of your application will be at startup. If you can't write out a log file, you can also use stderr and output to standard error output. This would normally result in output appearing in your web server log. log_level Type String Default info Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages, if you've set the log file location. This log_level will not affect the Python logging module log level. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are critical, error, warning, info, and debug. To report agent issues, the most useful setting is debug. However, debug generates a lot of information very quickly, so do not keep the agent at this level for longer than it takes to reproduce your problem. high_security Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data is sent to us. Enabling high security mode means that request parameters are not collected, and you cannot send raw SQL. To activate high security mode, set it to true in the local .ini configuration file and activate it in the Account Settings in the UI. For more information, see High security. proxy_scheme, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass Type Strings Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variables NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS By default, the Python agent attempts to directly connect to our servers. If there is a firewall between your host and the our collector that requires you to use an HTTP proxy, set proxy_host and proxy_port to the required values for your HTTP proxy. If proxy authentication is implemented by the HTTP proxy, also set proxy_user and proxy_pass. The proxy_scheme setting dictates what protocol scheme is used to talk to the HTTP proxy. When set to http, the agent uses a SSL tunnel through the HTTP proxy for end-to-end encryption. Instead of setting the proxy_scheme, proxy_host and proxy_port settings, you can also set the proxy_host setting to a valid URI for the proxy. Include the scheme, host, and port; for example, http://proxy-host:8000. This also works if you set the details of the HTTP proxy with the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST environment variable. Tip Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending whether ssl is disabled or enabled. If you are upgrading from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the ssl setting for backwards compatibility. As proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme, not setting proxy_scheme may result in a failure. audit_log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG Sets the name of the audit log file. If set, the agent logs details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the collector. This allows you to evaluate the security of the Python agent. Use an absolute path unless you are sure what your app's working directory will be at startup. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. Also ensure your web app's parent user can write to the file. Caution Do not use audit logging on an ongoing basis, especially in a production environment. Because the agent does not truncate or rotate the log file, the log file can grow very quickly. labels (tags) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS Adds tags. Specify name:value separated by a colon :, and separate additional tags with semicolons ;. Two tags Server:One;Data Center:Primary Copy process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. api_key Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_KEY Sets the api_key to be used with newrelic-admin record-deploy. ca_bundle_path Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 4.2.0 and newer. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T We'll record transaction traces when they exceed this threshold. The format is a number of seconds (decimal points allowed). See our glossary entry for apdex_t Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. In addition to configuring attributes for all four destinations with the general attribute settings below, they can also be configured on a per-destination basis. For more information, see Python agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes, and Attribute examples. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. Transaction tracer configuration Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. The agent automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? If enabled, the transaction tracer captures deep information about slow transactions. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Positive float or string (apdex_f) Default apdex_f Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds this threshold, the agent records a transaction trace. Valid values are any positive float, or apdex_f (four times apdex_t). transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default obfuscated Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Record SQL? When the transaction tracer is enabled, the agent can record SQL statements. The recorder has three modes: off (sends no SQL), raw (sends the SQL statement in its original form), and obfuscated (strips out numeric and string literals). Most web frameworks (including Django) parameterize SQL queries so they do not actually contain the values used to fill out the query. If you use raw mode with one of these frameworks, the Python agent will only see the SQL prior to insertion of values. The parametrized SQL will look much like obfuscated mode. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Stack trace threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack traces from SQL calls. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent captures the current stack trace. This is helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate in an application. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable SQL query plans? Determines whether the Python agent will capture query plans for slow SQL queries. Only supported in MySQL and PostgreSQL. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Query plan threshold Queries in transaction traces that exceed this threshold will report slow query data and any available explain plans. Explain plan collection will not happen if transaction_tracer.explain_enabled is false. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.function_trace Type String Default (none) Set in Config file For the specified functions or methods, the agent will capture additional function timing instrumentation. Specify these names in the form module:function or module:class.function. Transaction segment configuration Here are Transaction segment settings available via the agent configuration file. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for segments of transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to segments of transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_segments.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for segments of transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_segments.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Error collector configuration Here are error collector settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable error collection? If enabled, the error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions. error_collector.ignore_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these errors To stop collecting specific errors, set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to ignore. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip Before version 6.4.0 of the agent, this setting was named error_collector.ignore_errors. If your configuration file still uses ignore_errors, update your agent to use ignore_classes. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default 100-102 200-208 226 300-308 404 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these status codes Lists HTTP status codes which the agent should ignore rather than record as errors. List additional status codes as integers separated by spaces, and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To add one of the default codes to your allow list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option can only be set in server-side configuration in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these error class names Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to be expected. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these status codes Prevents specified HTTP status codes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. List status codes as integers separated by spaces and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To negate one of the codes in your list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python Agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless on how this configuration setting (error_collector.attributes.enabled) is set. error_collector.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file If enabled, the error collector captures event data for advanced analytics. For more information, see APM Errors. Browser monitoring settings Here are browser monitoring settings available via the agent configuration file. browser_monitoring.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables browser monitoring. For more information, see Page load timing in Python. Important Before enabling browser monitoring in the config file, enable it in the application settings in the browser monitoring UI. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file For supported Python web frameworks, this setting enables auto-insertion of the browser monitoring JavaScript fragments. browser_monitoring.content_type Type String Default text/html Set in Config file Specify the HTML Content-Type(s) that our browser monitoring agent should auto-instrument. Add additional entries in a space-separated list. Instrument xhtml+xml page responses If you are generating HTML page responses and using the Content-Type of application/xhtml+xml, you can override the allowed content types to list both this content type and the default text/html by using: browser_monitoring.content_type = text/html application/xhtml+xml Copy Important The browser monitoring JavaScript snippet prevents the page from validating as application/xhtml+xml, although the page should load and render in end-user browsers. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data which gets sent to page view events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how the configuration setting (browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled) is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Transaction events settings Here are Transaction events settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip These configuration settings used to be called analytic_events. If your configuration file still uses analytic_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. transaction_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Transaction event data allows the use of additional information such as histograms and percentiles. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_events.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_events.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in transaction events. Note that excluding attributes from transaction events does not exclude from span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events settings Here are custom events settings available via the agent configuration file. custom_insights_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Allow recording of events to the Insights custom events API via record_custom_event(). Datastore tracer settings These datastore tracer settings are available via the agent configuration file: datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are also reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects database name for some database drivers. The database name is reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. Distributed tracing settings Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Python agent version 4.2.0.100 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Settings include: distributed_tracing.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. Span event configuration Span events are collected for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Configuration options include: span_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off whether the Python agent sends spans. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off for all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this configuration setting (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Event harvest configuration Event harvest settings limit the amount of event type data sent to New Relic. When you use these settings, consider these important points: Event harvest settings affect the limits for a single instance of the agent, and not across the entire application. See the usage example below for how to set limits across an entire application. Real time streaming sends data every five seconds (12 times per minute), but the event harvest settings still affect the rate in events per minute. Enabling or disabling real time streaming does not require changing these settings. With real time streaming (enabled by default), New Relic will display the event harvest limits for entities in five second intervals. This means, for example, when you set a limit value of 1200 in the config file, you'll see it as 100 in New Relic. Usage example Let's say an application is deployed across 10 hosts, each running four processes per host. To limit the number of span events to 10,000 events per minute for the entire application, divide that number by 10 hosts. Then divide again by four processes per host. 10000 / (10 * 4) = 250 Based on that calculation, the final setting is: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data = 250 Event harvest configuration settings include: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.analytic_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for analytic events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.custom_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for custom events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Custom events are created through the Python Telemetry SDK. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data Type Integer Default 1000 Set in Config file Limit for span events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.error_event_data Type Integer Default 100 Set in Config file Limit for error events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Event loop visibility settings Important Requires Python agent version 5.0.0.124 or higher. Event loop visibility surfaces information about transactions that block the event loop. The agent will generate information about transactions that have waited a significant amount of time to acquire control of the event loop. Settings include: event_loop_visibility.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Set this to false to disable event loop information. event_loop_visibility.blocking_threshold Type Float Default 0.1 Set in Config file Threshold in seconds for how long a transaction must block the event loop before generating event loop information. Garbage collection runtime metrics settings Important Requires Python agent version 6.2.0.156 or higher. These garbage collection runtime metrics settings are available via the agent configuration file: gc_runtime_metrics.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file When enabled, the agent will generate and send garbage collection metrics. gc_runtime_metrics.top_object_count_limit Type Integer Default 5 Set in Config file The agent reports object count metrics for the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector. For each object type, this setting allows you to set the maximum number of individual metrics that will be sampled. Other configuration settings Here are assorted other settings available via the agent configuration file. utilization.detect_aws Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an AWS environment. utilization.detect_azure Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an Azure environment. utilization.detect_gcp Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Google Cloud Platform environment. utilization.detect_pcf Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment. utilization.detect_docker Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in Docker. slow_sql.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable Slow SQL? If enabled, the agent captures details from long-running SQL database queries. thread_profiler.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable thread profiler? Enables you to schedule thread profiling sessions. The thread profiler will periodically capture a snapshot of the call stack for each active thread in the application to construct a statistically representative call tree. cross_application_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables cross application tracing, which connect your apps and services within your service-oriented architecture. strip_exception_messages.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file If enabled, exception messages will be stripped from error traces before they are sent to the collector, in order to prevent the inadvertent capture of sensitive information. This option is automatically enabled in high security mode. strip_exception_messages.whitelist Type String Default (none) Set in Config file Exceptions listed in your allow list will not have their messages stripped, even if strip_exception_messages.enabled is true. The allow list is a space-separated string of exception types, each in the form of module:exception_name. List built-in exceptions as exception_name; you do not need to prepend module: to them. Example: Built-in exception and user-defined exception KeyError my_module:MyException Copy startup_timeout Type Float Default 0.0 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT By default, the agent starts when it receives the first transaction (either web or non-web). The agent then starts in parallel, ensuring that this initial request is not delayed. However, the agent does not record the details of this initial request because the agent cannot collect data until registration is complete. To override this, you can set a startup timeout in seconds. The agent will then pause the initial transaction and wait for registration to complete. Important Since startup_timeout delays your app start, we recommend only setting a startup timeout for background task queuing systems, not web applications. shutdown_timeout Type Float Default 2.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT On process shutdown, the agent attempts one final upload to the collector. To prevent the agent running indefinitely in case of an issue, the process shuts down normally if the shutdown_timeout threshold is reached. This shutdown can result in data loss, but the agent prioritizes key metric data during the upload process. For background task queuing systems, especially those which run a small number of tasks per process, you may want to increase the shutdown timeout to ensure the agent can upload all data on process shutdown. Tip The agent defaults to a 2.5 second timeout because Apache and many other web servers have a 3.0 second process termination timeout. The agent exits at 2.5 seconds to allow atexit cleanup code registered for the process to run. compressed_content_encoding Type String Default gzip Set in Config file If the data compression threshold is reached in the payload, the agent compresses data, using gzip compression by default. The config option compression_content_encoding can be set to deflate to use deflate compression. Heroku heroku.use_dyno_names Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_USE_DYNO_NAMES If true, the agent uses Heroku dyno names as the hostname. heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten Type Array Default [\"scheduler\", \"run\"] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_DYNO_NAME_PREFIXES_TO_SHORTEN Ordinarily the agent reports dyno names with a trailing dot and process ID (for example, worker.3). You can remove this trailing data by specifying the prefixes you want to report without trailing data (for example, worker). Built-in instrumentation The Python agent instruments a range of Python packages/modules. This instrumentation only occurs when the target Python package/module is imported by an application. To disable default instrumentation, provide a special import-hook section corresponding to the name of the module that triggered instrumentation. Then set the enabled setting to false to disable instrumentation of that module. Example: Disabling MySQLdb database query instrumentation Add the following to the configuration file: [import-hook:MySQLdb] enabled = false Copy",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent default security settings automatically provide security for your data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information we ingest. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

      "body": "Our Python agent lets you change the default agent behavior agent using configuration options. The only required Python agent configuration setting is the license key. The license key identifies the account where the agent reports application data. Depending on how you are hosting your application, the license key can be provided via a configuration file or an environment variable. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Python agent is via the configuration file, which is generated as part of the standard install process. It is also possible to set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI or by using environment variables. You can also specify some settings on a per-request basis by passing settings with the WSGI request environ dictionary. The Python agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: With the Python agent, per-request options override server-side config. If enabled, server-side config overrides all corresponding values in the agent config file, even if the server-side values are left blank. The agent config file overrides environment variables. Environment variables override the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file Typically you configure your Python agent from a local configuration file on the agent's host system. Supply the path to the config file at startup using one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the path to the config file as the first argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you use the newrelic-admin wrapper script, you must use the environment variable because the wrapper script calls the agent automatically. The configuration file uses a structure similar to Microsoft Windows .ini files. For more information, see the Python ConfigParser module's file format documentation. Tip A sample configuration file is included with the Python agent as newrelic/newrelic.ini. You can also generate one from the newrelic-admin script using the generate-config command, or download a copy from our download repo. Server-side configuration Tip Owner or Admins Server-side configuration allows you to configure certain settings in the New Relic One UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. Important If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the config file that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty string and does not use the agent config file. Environment variables Environment variables allow you to override the defaults for certain core settings. If the equivalent setting is explicitly listed in the agent config file, the config file settings take precedence over the environment variable. Where available, environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. For simple configurations, you can use the environment variables in conjunction with server-side configuration and avoid the agent config file altogether. This is the default setup with Heroku, where installing the New Relic add-on automatically populates the necessary environment variables. Environment variable Configuration setting NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY license_key NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME app_name NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE monitor_mode NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE developer_mode NEW_RELIC_LOG log_file NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL log_level NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY high_security NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME proxy_scheme NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST proxy_host NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT proxy_port NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER proxy_user NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS proxy_pass NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG audit_log_file NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT startup_timeout NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT shutdown_timeout NEW_RELIC_LABELS labels NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME process_host.display_name NEW_RELIC_API_KEY api_key NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH ca_bundle_path NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED distributed_tracing.enabled NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG feature_flag Per-request configuration For certain WSGI servers, you can override the app name and capture attributes settings on a per-request basis. This is possible with WSGI servers where you can define additional key/value pairs that are passed into the per-request WSGI environ dictionary. Set these values with the strings on, off, true, false, 1 and 0. If set from a configuration mechanism implemented using Python code, Python objects evaluating to True or False will also be accepted. Example: Apache/mod_wsgi app name In the Apache/mod_wsgi server, you can use the SetEnv directive to override config settings (optionally inside a Location or Directory block). For example, you could override the app name for a complete virtual host, or for a subset of URLs handled by the WSGI application for that virtual host. In addition to being able to override certain agent configuration settings, you can set other per-request configuration settings with their WSGI environment key: newrelic.set_background_task If set to true, this web transaction will instead be reported as a non-web transaction. newrelic.ignore_transaction If set to true, this web transaction will not be reported. newrelic.suppress_apdex_metric If set to true, no Apdex metric will be generated for this web transaction. newrelic.suppress_transaction_trace If set to true, this web transaction cannot be recorded in a transaction trace. newrelic.disable_browser_autorum If set to true, this disables automatic insertion of the JavaScript header/footer for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). Only applicable if auto-insertion is available for your web framework. Important Using a WSGI middleware to set these values will not work where the Python agent's own WSGI application wrapper was applied at an outer scope. In these cases you must make calls to the agent API to achieve the same outcome. Multiple environment configuration The agent reads its primary configuration from an agent config section called newrelic. You can provide overrides for specific deployment environments (for example, Development, Staging, Production) in additional sections. Preface these sections with [newrelic:environment], where environment is replaced with the name of your environment. To specify that the agent should use an environment-based configuration, use one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the environment name as the second argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT environment variable to the environment name. If no environment is specified, the agent will use the default settings as specified in the newrelic agent config section. The basic structure of the configuration file is: [newrelic] ... default settings [newrelic:development] ... override settings [newrelic:staging] ... override settings [newrelic:production] ... override settings Copy General configuration settings These settings are available in the agent configuration file. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Specifies the license key of your New Relic account. This key associates your app's metrics with your New Relic account. app_name (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Type String Default Python Application Set in Per-request option, config file, environment variable Per-request option newrelic.app_name Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic One UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon ;. Do not put a space before the semicolon, which causes the Python config parser to interpret the name as an embedded comment. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent collects performance data about your app and reports this data to our data collector. developer_mode Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE When true, the agent will instrument your web app, but will not send any actual data. In this offline mode, you will not be billed for an active agent. Use developer mode to test new versions of the agent, or test the agent against third-party packages in a developer environment. Offline mode is not a way of running the APM locally, because the metrics the agent collects are not reported anywhere. log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Sets the name of a log file, which is useful for debugging issues with the agent. This is not set by default, since the agent does not know your web app process's parent user or what directories that process has permission to write to. For detailed information, see Python agent logging. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct, and that the user that your web application runs as can write to the file. Tip Use an absolute path unless you are sure what the working directory of your application will be at startup. If you can't write out a log file, you can also use stderr and output to standard error output. This would normally result in output appearing in your web server log. log_level Type String Default info Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages, if you've set the log file location. This log_level will not affect the Python logging module log level. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are critical, error, warning, info, and debug. To report agent issues, the most useful setting is debug. However, debug generates a lot of information very quickly, so do not keep the agent at this level for longer than it takes to reproduce your problem. high_security Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data is sent to us. Enabling high security mode means that request parameters are not collected, and you cannot send raw SQL. To activate high security mode, set it to true in the local .ini configuration file and activate it in the Account Settings in the UI. For more information, see High security. proxy_scheme, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass Type Strings Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variables NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS By default, the Python agent attempts to directly connect to our servers. If there is a firewall between your host and the our collector that requires you to use an HTTP proxy, set proxy_host and proxy_port to the required values for your HTTP proxy. If proxy authentication is implemented by the HTTP proxy, also set proxy_user and proxy_pass. The proxy_scheme setting dictates what protocol scheme is used to talk to the HTTP proxy. When set to http, the agent uses a SSL tunnel through the HTTP proxy for end-to-end encryption. Instead of setting the proxy_scheme, proxy_host and proxy_port settings, you can also set the proxy_host setting to a valid URI for the proxy. Include the scheme, host, and port; for example, http://proxy-host:8000. This also works if you set the details of the HTTP proxy with the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST environment variable. Tip Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending whether ssl is disabled or enabled. If you are upgrading from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the ssl setting for backwards compatibility. As proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme, not setting proxy_scheme may result in a failure. audit_log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG Sets the name of the audit log file. If set, the agent logs details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the collector. This allows you to evaluate the security of the Python agent. Use an absolute path unless you are sure what your app's working directory will be at startup. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. Also ensure your web app's parent user can write to the file. Caution Do not use audit logging on an ongoing basis, especially in a production environment. Because the agent does not truncate or rotate the log file, the log file can grow very quickly. labels (tags) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS Adds tags. Specify name:value separated by a colon :, and separate additional tags with semicolons ;. Two tags Server:One;Data Center:Primary Copy process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. api_key Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_KEY Sets the api_key to be used with newrelic-admin record-deploy. ca_bundle_path Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 4.2.0 and newer. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T We'll record transaction traces when they exceed this threshold. The format is a number of seconds (decimal points allowed). See our glossary entry for apdex_t Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. In addition to configuring attributes for all four destinations with the general attribute settings below, they can also be configured on a per-destination basis. For more information, see Python agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes, and Attribute examples. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. Transaction tracer configuration Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. The agent automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? If enabled, the transaction tracer captures deep information about slow transactions. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Positive float or string (apdex_f) Default apdex_f Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds this threshold, the agent records a transaction trace. Valid values are any positive float, or apdex_f (four times apdex_t). transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default obfuscated Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Record SQL? When the transaction tracer is enabled, the agent can record SQL statements. The recorder has three modes: off (sends no SQL), raw (sends the SQL statement in its original form), and obfuscated (strips out numeric and string literals). Most web frameworks (including Django) parameterize SQL queries so they do not actually contain the values used to fill out the query. If you use raw mode with one of these frameworks, the Python agent will only see the SQL prior to insertion of values. The parametrized SQL will look much like obfuscated mode. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Stack trace threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack traces from SQL calls. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent captures the current stack trace. This is helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate in an application. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable SQL query plans? Determines whether the Python agent will capture query plans for slow SQL queries. Only supported in MySQL and PostgreSQL. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Query plan threshold Queries in transaction traces that exceed this threshold will report slow query data and any available explain plans. Explain plan collection will not happen if transaction_tracer.explain_enabled is false. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.function_trace Type String Default (none) Set in Config file For the specified functions or methods, the agent will capture additional function timing instrumentation. Specify these names in the form module:function or module:class.function. Transaction segment configuration Here are Transaction segment settings available via the agent configuration file. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for segments of transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to segments of transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_segments.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for segments of transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_segments.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Error collector configuration Here are error collector settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable error collection? If enabled, the error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions. error_collector.ignore_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these errors To stop collecting specific errors, set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to ignore. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip Before version 6.4.0 of the agent, this setting was named error_collector.ignore_errors. If your configuration file still uses ignore_errors, update your agent to use ignore_classes. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default 100-102 200-208 226 300-308 404 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these status codes Lists HTTP status codes which the agent should ignore rather than record as errors. List additional status codes as integers separated by spaces, and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To add one of the default codes to your allow list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option can only be set in server-side configuration in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these error class names Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to be expected. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these status codes Prevents specified HTTP status codes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. List status codes as integers separated by spaces and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To negate one of the codes in your list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python Agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless on how this configuration setting (error_collector.attributes.enabled) is set. error_collector.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file If enabled, the error collector captures event data for advanced analytics. For more information, see APM Errors. Browser monitoring settings Here are browser monitoring settings available via the agent configuration file. browser_monitoring.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables browser monitoring. For more information, see Page load timing in Python. Important Before enabling browser monitoring in the config file, enable it in the application settings in the browser monitoring UI. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file For supported Python web frameworks, this setting enables auto-insertion of the browser monitoring JavaScript fragments. browser_monitoring.content_type Type String Default text/html Set in Config file Specify the HTML Content-Type(s) that our browser monitoring agent should auto-instrument. Add additional entries in a space-separated list. Instrument xhtml+xml page responses If you are generating HTML page responses and using the Content-Type of application/xhtml+xml, you can override the allowed content types to list both this content type and the default text/html by using: browser_monitoring.content_type = text/html application/xhtml+xml Copy Important The browser monitoring JavaScript snippet prevents the page from validating as application/xhtml+xml, although the page should load and render in end-user browsers. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data which gets sent to page view events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how the configuration setting (browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled) is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Transaction events settings Here are Transaction events settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip These configuration settings used to be called analytic_events. If your configuration file still uses analytic_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. transaction_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Transaction event data allows the use of additional information such as histograms and percentiles. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_events.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_events.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in transaction events. Note that excluding attributes from transaction events does not exclude from span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events settings Here are custom events settings available via the agent configuration file. custom_insights_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Allow recording of events to the Insights custom events API via record_custom_event(). Datastore tracer settings These datastore tracer settings are available via the agent configuration file: datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are also reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects database name for some database drivers. The database name is reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. Distributed tracing settings Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Python agent version 4.2.0.100 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Settings include: distributed_tracing.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. Span event configuration Span events are collected for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Configuration options include: span_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off whether the Python agent sends spans. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off for all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this configuration setting (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Event harvest configuration Event harvest settings limit the amount of event type data sent to New Relic. When you use these settings, consider these important points: Event harvest settings affect the limits for a single instance of the agent, and not across the entire application. See the usage example below for how to set limits across an entire application. Real time streaming sends data every five seconds (12 times per minute), but the event harvest settings still affect the rate in events per minute. Enabling or disabling real time streaming does not require changing these settings. With real time streaming (enabled by default), New Relic will display the event harvest limits for entities in five second intervals. This means, for example, when you set a limit value of 1200 in the config file, you'll see it as 100 in New Relic. Usage example Let's say an application is deployed across 10 hosts, each running four processes per host. To limit the number of span events to 10,000 events per minute for the entire application, divide that number by 10 hosts. Then divide again by four processes per host. 10000 / (10 * 4) = 250 Based on that calculation, the final setting is: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data = 250 Event harvest configuration settings include: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.analytic_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for analytic events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.custom_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for custom events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Custom events are created through the Python Telemetry SDK. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data Type Integer Default 1000 Set in Config file Limit for span events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.error_event_data Type Integer Default 100 Set in Config file Limit for error events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Event loop visibility settings Important Requires Python agent version 5.0.0.124 or higher. Event loop visibility surfaces information about transactions that block the event loop. The agent will generate information about transactions that have waited a significant amount of time to acquire control of the event loop. Settings include: event_loop_visibility.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Set this to false to disable event loop information. event_loop_visibility.blocking_threshold Type Float Default 0.1 Set in Config file Threshold in seconds for how long a transaction must block the event loop before generating event loop information. Garbage collection runtime metrics settings Important Requires Python agent version 6.2.0.156 or higher. These garbage collection runtime metrics settings are available via the agent configuration file: gc_runtime_metrics.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file When enabled, the agent will generate and send garbage collection metrics. gc_runtime_metrics.top_object_count_limit Type Integer Default 5 Set in Config file The agent reports object count metrics for the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector. For each object type, this setting allows you to set the maximum number of individual metrics that will be sampled. Other configuration settings Here are assorted other settings available via the agent configuration file. utilization.detect_aws Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an AWS environment. utilization.detect_azure Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an Azure environment. utilization.detect_gcp Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Google Cloud Platform environment. utilization.detect_pcf Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment. utilization.detect_docker Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in Docker. slow_sql.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable Slow SQL? If enabled, the agent captures details from long-running SQL database queries. thread_profiler.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable thread profiler? Enables you to schedule thread profiling sessions. The thread profiler will periodically capture a snapshot of the call stack for each active thread in the application to construct a statistically representative call tree. cross_application_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables cross application tracing, which connect your apps and services within your service-oriented architecture. strip_exception_messages.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file If enabled, exception messages will be stripped from error traces before they are sent to the collector, in order to prevent the inadvertent capture of sensitive information. This option is automatically enabled in high security mode. strip_exception_messages.whitelist Type String Default (none) Set in Config file Exceptions listed in your allow list will not have their messages stripped, even if strip_exception_messages.enabled is true. The allow list is a space-separated string of exception types, each in the form of module:exception_name. List built-in exceptions as exception_name; you do not need to prepend module: to them. Example: Built-in exception and user-defined exception KeyError my_module:MyException Copy startup_timeout Type Float Default 0.0 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT By default, the agent starts when it receives the first transaction (either web or non-web). The agent then starts in parallel, ensuring that this initial request is not delayed. However, the agent does not record the details of this initial request because the agent cannot collect data until registration is complete. To override this, you can set a startup timeout in seconds. The agent will then pause the initial transaction and wait for registration to complete. Important Since startup_timeout delays your app start, we recommend only setting a startup timeout for background task queuing systems, not web applications. shutdown_timeout Type Float Default 2.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT On process shutdown, the agent attempts one final upload to the collector. To prevent the agent running indefinitely in case of an issue, the process shuts down normally if the shutdown_timeout threshold is reached. This shutdown can result in data loss, but the agent prioritizes key metric data during the upload process. For background task queuing systems, especially those which run a small number of tasks per process, you may want to increase the shutdown timeout to ensure the agent can upload all data on process shutdown. Tip The agent defaults to a 2.5 second timeout because Apache and many other web servers have a 3.0 second process termination timeout. The agent exits at 2.5 seconds to allow atexit cleanup code registered for the process to run. compressed_content_encoding Type String Default gzip Set in Config file If the data compression threshold is reached in the payload, the agent compresses data, using gzip compression by default. The config option compression_content_encoding can be set to deflate to use deflate compression. Heroku heroku.use_dyno_names Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_USE_DYNO_NAMES If true, the agent uses Heroku dyno names as the hostname. heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten Type Array Default [\"scheduler\", \"run\"] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_DYNO_NAME_PREFIXES_TO_SHORTEN Ordinarily the agent reports dyno names with a trailing dot and process ID (for example, worker.3). You can remove this trailing data by specifying the prefixes you want to report without trailing data (for example, worker). Built-in instrumentation The Python agent instruments a range of Python packages/modules. This instrumentation only occurs when the target Python package/module is imported by an application. To disable default instrumentation, provide a special import-hook section corresponding to the name of the module that triggered instrumentation. Then set the enabled setting to false to disable instrumentation of that module. Example: Disabling MySQLdb database query instrumentation Add the following to the configuration file: [import-hook:MySQLdb] enabled = false Copy",

      "body": "The Python agent default security settings automatically provide security for your data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information we ingest. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

      "body": "Our Python agent lets you change the default agent behavior agent using configuration options. The only required Python agent configuration setting is the license key. The license key identifies the account where the agent reports application data. Depending on how you are hosting your application, the license key can be provided via a configuration file or an environment variable. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Python agent is via the configuration file, which is generated as part of the standard install process. It is also possible to set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI or by using environment variables. You can also specify some settings on a per-request basis by passing settings with the WSGI request environ dictionary. The Python agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: With the Python agent, per-request options override server-side config. If enabled, server-side config overrides all corresponding values in the agent config file, even if the server-side values are left blank. The agent config file overrides environment variables. Environment variables override the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file Typically you configure your Python agent from a local configuration file on the agent's host system. Supply the path to the config file at startup using one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the path to the config file as the first argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you use the newrelic-admin wrapper script, you must use the environment variable because the wrapper script calls the agent automatically. The configuration file uses a structure similar to Microsoft Windows .ini files. For more information, see the Python ConfigParser module's file format documentation. Tip A sample configuration file is included with the Python agent as newrelic/newrelic.ini. You can also generate one from the newrelic-admin script using the generate-config command, or download a copy from our download repo. Server-side configuration Tip Owner or Admins Server-side configuration allows you to configure certain settings in the New Relic One UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. Important If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the config file that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty string and does not use the agent config file. Environment variables Environment variables allow you to override the defaults for certain core settings. If the equivalent setting is explicitly listed in the agent config file, the config file settings take precedence over the environment variable. Where available, environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. For simple configurations, you can use the environment variables in conjunction with server-side configuration and avoid the agent config file altogether. This is the default setup with Heroku, where installing the New Relic add-on automatically populates the necessary environment variables. Environment variable Configuration setting NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY license_key NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME app_name NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE monitor_mode NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE developer_mode NEW_RELIC_LOG log_file NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL log_level NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY high_security NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME proxy_scheme NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST proxy_host NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT proxy_port NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER proxy_user NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS proxy_pass NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG audit_log_file NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT startup_timeout NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT shutdown_timeout NEW_RELIC_LABELS labels NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME process_host.display_name NEW_RELIC_API_KEY api_key NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH ca_bundle_path NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED distributed_tracing.enabled NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG feature_flag Per-request configuration For certain WSGI servers, you can override the app name and capture attributes settings on a per-request basis. This is possible with WSGI servers where you can define additional key/value pairs that are passed into the per-request WSGI environ dictionary. Set these values with the strings on, off, true, false, 1 and 0. If set from a configuration mechanism implemented using Python code, Python objects evaluating to True or False will also be accepted. Example: Apache/mod_wsgi app name In the Apache/mod_wsgi server, you can use the SetEnv directive to override config settings (optionally inside a Location or Directory block). For example, you could override the app name for a complete virtual host, or for a subset of URLs handled by the WSGI application for that virtual host. In addition to being able to override certain agent configuration settings, you can set other per-request configuration settings with their WSGI environment key: newrelic.set_background_task If set to true, this web transaction will instead be reported as a non-web transaction. newrelic.ignore_transaction If set to true, this web transaction will not be reported. newrelic.suppress_apdex_metric If set to true, no Apdex metric will be generated for this web transaction. newrelic.suppress_transaction_trace If set to true, this web transaction cannot be recorded in a transaction trace. newrelic.disable_browser_autorum If set to true, this disables automatic insertion of the JavaScript header/footer for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). Only applicable if auto-insertion is available for your web framework. Important Using a WSGI middleware to set these values will not work where the Python agent's own WSGI application wrapper was applied at an outer scope. In these cases you must make calls to the agent API to achieve the same outcome. Multiple environment configuration The agent reads its primary configuration from an agent config section called newrelic. You can provide overrides for specific deployment environments (for example, Development, Staging, Production) in additional sections. Preface these sections with [newrelic:environment], where environment is replaced with the name of your environment. To specify that the agent should use an environment-based configuration, use one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the environment name as the second argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT environment variable to the environment name. If no environment is specified, the agent will use the default settings as specified in the newrelic agent config section. The basic structure of the configuration file is: [newrelic] ... default settings [newrelic:development] ... override settings [newrelic:staging] ... override settings [newrelic:production] ... override settings Copy General configuration settings These settings are available in the agent configuration file. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Specifies the license key of your New Relic account. This key associates your app's metrics with your New Relic account. app_name (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Type String Default Python Application Set in Per-request option, config file, environment variable Per-request option newrelic.app_name Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic One UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon ;. Do not put a space before the semicolon, which causes the Python config parser to interpret the name as an embedded comment. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent collects performance data about your app and reports this data to our data collector. developer_mode Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE When true, the agent will instrument your web app, but will not send any actual data. In this offline mode, you will not be billed for an active agent. Use developer mode to test new versions of the agent, or test the agent against third-party packages in a developer environment. Offline mode is not a way of running the APM locally, because the metrics the agent collects are not reported anywhere. log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Sets the name of a log file, which is useful for debugging issues with the agent. This is not set by default, since the agent does not know your web app process's parent user or what directories that process has permission to write to. For detailed information, see Python agent logging. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct, and that the user that your web application runs as can write to the file. Tip Use an absolute path unless you are sure what the working directory of your application will be at startup. If you can't write out a log file, you can also use stderr and output to standard error output. This would normally result in output appearing in your web server log. log_level Type String Default info Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages, if you've set the log file location. This log_level will not affect the Python logging module log level. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are critical, error, warning, info, and debug. To report agent issues, the most useful setting is debug. However, debug generates a lot of information very quickly, so do not keep the agent at this level for longer than it takes to reproduce your problem. high_security Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data is sent to us. Enabling high security mode means that request parameters are not collected, and you cannot send raw SQL. To activate high security mode, set it to true in the local .ini configuration file and activate it in the Account Settings in the UI. For more information, see High security. proxy_scheme, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass Type Strings Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variables NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS By default, the Python agent attempts to directly connect to our servers. If there is a firewall between your host and the our collector that requires you to use an HTTP proxy, set proxy_host and proxy_port to the required values for your HTTP proxy. If proxy authentication is implemented by the HTTP proxy, also set proxy_user and proxy_pass. The proxy_scheme setting dictates what protocol scheme is used to talk to the HTTP proxy. When set to http, the agent uses a SSL tunnel through the HTTP proxy for end-to-end encryption. Instead of setting the proxy_scheme, proxy_host and proxy_port settings, you can also set the proxy_host setting to a valid URI for the proxy. Include the scheme, host, and port; for example, http://proxy-host:8000. This also works if you set the details of the HTTP proxy with the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST environment variable. Tip Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending whether ssl is disabled or enabled. If you are upgrading from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the ssl setting for backwards compatibility. As proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme, not setting proxy_scheme may result in a failure. audit_log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG Sets the name of the audit log file. If set, the agent logs details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the collector. This allows you to evaluate the security of the Python agent. Use an absolute path unless you are sure what your app's working directory will be at startup. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. Also ensure your web app's parent user can write to the file. Caution Do not use audit logging on an ongoing basis, especially in a production environment. Because the agent does not truncate or rotate the log file, the log file can grow very quickly. labels (tags) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS Adds tags. Specify name:value separated by a colon :, and separate additional tags with semicolons ;. Two tags Server:One;Data Center:Primary Copy process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. api_key Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_KEY Sets the api_key to be used with newrelic-admin record-deploy. ca_bundle_path Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 4.2.0 and newer. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T We'll record transaction traces when they exceed this threshold. The format is a number of seconds (decimal points allowed). See our glossary entry for apdex_t Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. In addition to configuring attributes for all four destinations with the general attribute settings below, they can also be configured on a per-destination basis. For more information, see Python agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes, and Attribute examples. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. Transaction tracer configuration Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. The agent automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? If enabled, the transaction tracer captures deep information about slow transactions. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Positive float or string (apdex_f) Default apdex_f Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds this threshold, the agent records a transaction trace. Valid values are any positive float, or apdex_f (four times apdex_t). transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default obfuscated Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Record SQL? When the transaction tracer is enabled, the agent can record SQL statements. The recorder has three modes: off (sends no SQL), raw (sends the SQL statement in its original form), and obfuscated (strips out numeric and string literals). Most web frameworks (including Django) parameterize SQL queries so they do not actually contain the values used to fill out the query. If you use raw mode with one of these frameworks, the Python agent will only see the SQL prior to insertion of values. The parametrized SQL will look much like obfuscated mode. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Stack trace threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack traces from SQL calls. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent captures the current stack trace. This is helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate in an application. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable SQL query plans? Determines whether the Python agent will capture query plans for slow SQL queries. Only supported in MySQL and PostgreSQL. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Query plan threshold Queries in transaction traces that exceed this threshold will report slow query data and any available explain plans. Explain plan collection will not happen if transaction_tracer.explain_enabled is false. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.function_trace Type String Default (none) Set in Config file For the specified functions or methods, the agent will capture additional function timing instrumentation. Specify these names in the form module:function or module:class.function. Transaction segment configuration Here are Transaction segment settings available via the agent configuration file. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for segments of transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to segments of transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_segments.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for segments of transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_segments.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Error collector configuration Here are error collector settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable error collection? If enabled, the error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions. error_collector.ignore_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these errors To stop collecting specific errors, set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to ignore. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip Before version 6.4.0 of the agent, this setting was named error_collector.ignore_errors. If your configuration file still uses ignore_errors, update your agent to use ignore_classes. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default 100-102 200-208 226 300-308 404 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these status codes Lists HTTP status codes which the agent should ignore rather than record as errors. List additional status codes as integers separated by spaces, and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To add one of the default codes to your allow list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option can only be set in server-side configuration in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these error class names Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to be expected. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these status codes Prevents specified HTTP status codes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. List status codes as integers separated by spaces and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To negate one of the codes in your list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python Agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless on how this configuration setting (error_collector.attributes.enabled) is set. error_collector.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file If enabled, the error collector captures event data for advanced analytics. For more information, see APM Errors. Browser monitoring settings Here are browser monitoring settings available via the agent configuration file. browser_monitoring.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables browser monitoring. For more information, see Page load timing in Python. Important Before enabling browser monitoring in the config file, enable it in the application settings in the browser monitoring UI. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file For supported Python web frameworks, this setting enables auto-insertion of the browser monitoring JavaScript fragments. browser_monitoring.content_type Type String Default text/html Set in Config file Specify the HTML Content-Type(s) that our browser monitoring agent should auto-instrument. Add additional entries in a space-separated list. Instrument xhtml+xml page responses If you are generating HTML page responses and using the Content-Type of application/xhtml+xml, you can override the allowed content types to list both this content type and the default text/html by using: browser_monitoring.content_type = text/html application/xhtml+xml Copy Important The browser monitoring JavaScript snippet prevents the page from validating as application/xhtml+xml, although the page should load and render in end-user browsers. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data which gets sent to page view events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how the configuration setting (browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled) is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Transaction events settings Here are Transaction events settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip These configuration settings used to be called analytic_events. If your configuration file still uses analytic_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. transaction_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Transaction event data allows the use of additional information such as histograms and percentiles. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_events.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_events.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in transaction events. Note that excluding attributes from transaction events does not exclude from span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events settings Here are custom events settings available via the agent configuration file. custom_insights_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Allow recording of events to the Insights custom events API via record_custom_event(). Datastore tracer settings These datastore tracer settings are available via the agent configuration file: datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are also reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects database name for some database drivers. The database name is reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. Distributed tracing settings Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Python agent version 4.2.0.100 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Settings include: distributed_tracing.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. Span event configuration Span events are collected for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Configuration options include: span_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off whether the Python agent sends spans. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off for all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this configuration setting (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Event harvest configuration Event harvest settings limit the amount of event type data sent to New Relic. When you use these settings, consider these important points: Event harvest settings affect the limits for a single instance of the agent, and not across the entire application. See the usage example below for how to set limits across an entire application. Real time streaming sends data every five seconds (12 times per minute), but the event harvest settings still affect the rate in events per minute. Enabling or disabling real time streaming does not require changing these settings. With real time streaming (enabled by default), New Relic will display the event harvest limits for entities in five second intervals. This means, for example, when you set a limit value of 1200 in the config file, you'll see it as 100 in New Relic. Usage example Let's say an application is deployed across 10 hosts, each running four processes per host. To limit the number of span events to 10,000 events per minute for the entire application, divide that number by 10 hosts. Then divide again by four processes per host. 10000 / (10 * 4) = 250 Based on that calculation, the final setting is: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data = 250 Event harvest configuration settings include: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.analytic_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for analytic events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.custom_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for custom events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Custom events are created through the Python Telemetry SDK. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data Type Integer Default 1000 Set in Config file Limit for span events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.error_event_data Type Integer Default 100 Set in Config file Limit for error events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Event loop visibility settings Important Requires Python agent version 5.0.0.124 or higher. Event loop visibility surfaces information about transactions that block the event loop. The agent will generate information about transactions that have waited a significant amount of time to acquire control of the event loop. Settings include: event_loop_visibility.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Set this to false to disable event loop information. event_loop_visibility.blocking_threshold Type Float Default 0.1 Set in Config file Threshold in seconds for how long a transaction must block the event loop before generating event loop information. Garbage collection runtime metrics settings Important Requires Python agent version 6.2.0.156 or higher. These garbage collection runtime metrics settings are available via the agent configuration file: gc_runtime_metrics.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file When enabled, the agent will generate and send garbage collection metrics. gc_runtime_metrics.top_object_count_limit Type Integer Default 5 Set in Config file The agent reports object count metrics for the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector. For each object type, this setting allows you to set the maximum number of individual metrics that will be sampled. Other configuration settings Here are assorted other settings available via the agent configuration file. utilization.detect_aws Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an AWS environment. utilization.detect_azure Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an Azure environment. utilization.detect_gcp Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Google Cloud Platform environment. utilization.detect_pcf Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment. utilization.detect_docker Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in Docker. slow_sql.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable Slow SQL? If enabled, the agent captures details from long-running SQL database queries. thread_profiler.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable thread profiler? Enables you to schedule thread profiling sessions. The thread profiler will periodically capture a snapshot of the call stack for each active thread in the application to construct a statistically representative call tree. cross_application_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables cross application tracing, which connect your apps and services within your service-oriented architecture. strip_exception_messages.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file If enabled, exception messages will be stripped from error traces before they are sent to the collector, in order to prevent the inadvertent capture of sensitive information. This option is automatically enabled in high security mode. strip_exception_messages.whitelist Type String Default (none) Set in Config file Exceptions listed in your allow list will not have their messages stripped, even if strip_exception_messages.enabled is true. The allow list is a space-separated string of exception types, each in the form of module:exception_name. List built-in exceptions as exception_name; you do not need to prepend module: to them. Example: Built-in exception and user-defined exception KeyError my_module:MyException Copy startup_timeout Type Float Default 0.0 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT By default, the agent starts when it receives the first transaction (either web or non-web). The agent then starts in parallel, ensuring that this initial request is not delayed. However, the agent does not record the details of this initial request because the agent cannot collect data until registration is complete. To override this, you can set a startup timeout in seconds. The agent will then pause the initial transaction and wait for registration to complete. Important Since startup_timeout delays your app start, we recommend only setting a startup timeout for background task queuing systems, not web applications. shutdown_timeout Type Float Default 2.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT On process shutdown, the agent attempts one final upload to the collector. To prevent the agent running indefinitely in case of an issue, the process shuts down normally if the shutdown_timeout threshold is reached. This shutdown can result in data loss, but the agent prioritizes key metric data during the upload process. For background task queuing systems, especially those which run a small number of tasks per process, you may want to increase the shutdown timeout to ensure the agent can upload all data on process shutdown. Tip The agent defaults to a 2.5 second timeout because Apache and many other web servers have a 3.0 second process termination timeout. The agent exits at 2.5 seconds to allow atexit cleanup code registered for the process to run. compressed_content_encoding Type String Default gzip Set in Config file If the data compression threshold is reached in the payload, the agent compresses data, using gzip compression by default. The config option compression_content_encoding can be set to deflate to use deflate compression. Heroku heroku.use_dyno_names Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_USE_DYNO_NAMES If true, the agent uses Heroku dyno names as the hostname. heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten Type Array Default [\"scheduler\", \"run\"] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_DYNO_NAME_PREFIXES_TO_SHORTEN Ordinarily the agent reports dyno names with a trailing dot and process ID (for example, worker.3). You can remove this trailing data by specifying the prefixes you want to report without trailing data (for example, worker). Built-in instrumentation The Python agent instruments a range of Python packages/modules. This instrumentation only occurs when the target Python package/module is imported by an application. To disable default instrumentation, provide a special import-hook section corresponding to the name of the module that triggered instrumentation. Then set the enabled setting to false to disable instrumentation of that module. Example: Disabling MySQLdb database query instrumentation Add the following to the configuration file: [import-hook:MySQLdb] enabled = false Copy",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent default security settings automatically provide security for your data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information we ingest. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

      "body": "Our Python agent lets you change the default agent behavior agent using configuration options. The only required Python agent configuration setting is the license key. The license key identifies the account where the agent reports application data. Depending on how you are hosting your application, the license key can be provided via a configuration file or an environment variable. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Python agent is via the configuration file, which is generated as part of the standard install process. It is also possible to set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI or by using environment variables. You can also specify some settings on a per-request basis by passing settings with the WSGI request environ dictionary. The Python agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: With the Python agent, per-request options override server-side config. If enabled, server-side config overrides all corresponding values in the agent config file, even if the server-side values are left blank. The agent config file overrides environment variables. Environment variables override the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file Typically you configure your Python agent from a local configuration file on the agent's host system. Supply the path to the config file at startup using one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the path to the config file as the first argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you use the newrelic-admin wrapper script, you must use the environment variable because the wrapper script calls the agent automatically. The configuration file uses a structure similar to Microsoft Windows .ini files. For more information, see the Python ConfigParser module's file format documentation. Tip A sample configuration file is included with the Python agent as newrelic/newrelic.ini. You can also generate one from the newrelic-admin script using the generate-config command, or download a copy from our download repo. Server-side configuration Tip Owner or Admins Server-side configuration allows you to configure certain settings in the New Relic One UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. Important If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the config file that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty string and does not use the agent config file. Environment variables Environment variables allow you to override the defaults for certain core settings. If the equivalent setting is explicitly listed in the agent config file, the config file settings take precedence over the environment variable. Where available, environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. For simple configurations, you can use the environment variables in conjunction with server-side configuration and avoid the agent config file altogether. This is the default setup with Heroku, where installing the New Relic add-on automatically populates the necessary environment variables. Environment variable Configuration setting NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY license_key NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME app_name NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE monitor_mode NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE developer_mode NEW_RELIC_LOG log_file NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL log_level NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY high_security NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME proxy_scheme NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST proxy_host NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT proxy_port NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER proxy_user NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS proxy_pass NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG audit_log_file NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT startup_timeout NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT shutdown_timeout NEW_RELIC_LABELS labels NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME process_host.display_name NEW_RELIC_API_KEY api_key NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH ca_bundle_path NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED distributed_tracing.enabled NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG feature_flag Per-request configuration For certain WSGI servers, you can override the app name and capture attributes settings on a per-request basis. This is possible with WSGI servers where you can define additional key/value pairs that are passed into the per-request WSGI environ dictionary. Set these values with the strings on, off, true, false, 1 and 0. If set from a configuration mechanism implemented using Python code, Python objects evaluating to True or False will also be accepted. Example: Apache/mod_wsgi app name In the Apache/mod_wsgi server, you can use the SetEnv directive to override config settings (optionally inside a Location or Directory block). For example, you could override the app name for a complete virtual host, or for a subset of URLs handled by the WSGI application for that virtual host. In addition to being able to override certain agent configuration settings, you can set other per-request configuration settings with their WSGI environment key: newrelic.set_background_task If set to true, this web transaction will instead be reported as a non-web transaction. newrelic.ignore_transaction If set to true, this web transaction will not be reported. newrelic.suppress_apdex_metric If set to true, no Apdex metric will be generated for this web transaction. newrelic.suppress_transaction_trace If set to true, this web transaction cannot be recorded in a transaction trace. newrelic.disable_browser_autorum If set to true, this disables automatic insertion of the JavaScript header/footer for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). Only applicable if auto-insertion is available for your web framework. Important Using a WSGI middleware to set these values will not work where the Python agent's own WSGI application wrapper was applied at an outer scope. In these cases you must make calls to the agent API to achieve the same outcome. Multiple environment configuration The agent reads its primary configuration from an agent config section called newrelic. You can provide overrides for specific deployment environments (for example, Development, Staging, Production) in additional sections. Preface these sections with [newrelic:environment], where environment is replaced with the name of your environment. To specify that the agent should use an environment-based configuration, use one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the environment name as the second argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT environment variable to the environment name. If no environment is specified, the agent will use the default settings as specified in the newrelic agent config section. The basic structure of the configuration file is: [newrelic] ... default settings [newrelic:development] ... override settings [newrelic:staging] ... override settings [newrelic:production] ... override settings Copy General configuration settings These settings are available in the agent configuration file. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Specifies the license key of your New Relic account. This key associates your app's metrics with your New Relic account. app_name (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Type String Default Python Application Set in Per-request option, config file, environment variable Per-request option newrelic.app_name Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic One UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon ;. Do not put a space before the semicolon, which causes the Python config parser to interpret the name as an embedded comment. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent collects performance data about your app and reports this data to our data collector. developer_mode Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE When true, the agent will instrument your web app, but will not send any actual data. In this offline mode, you will not be billed for an active agent. Use developer mode to test new versions of the agent, or test the agent against third-party packages in a developer environment. Offline mode is not a way of running the APM locally, because the metrics the agent collects are not reported anywhere. log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Sets the name of a log file, which is useful for debugging issues with the agent. This is not set by default, since the agent does not know your web app process's parent user or what directories that process has permission to write to. For detailed information, see Python agent logging. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct, and that the user that your web application runs as can write to the file. Tip Use an absolute path unless you are sure what the working directory of your application will be at startup. If you can't write out a log file, you can also use stderr and output to standard error output. This would normally result in output appearing in your web server log. log_level Type String Default info Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages, if you've set the log file location. This log_level will not affect the Python logging module log level. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are critical, error, warning, info, and debug. To report agent issues, the most useful setting is debug. However, debug generates a lot of information very quickly, so do not keep the agent at this level for longer than it takes to reproduce your problem. high_security Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data is sent to us. Enabling high security mode means that request parameters are not collected, and you cannot send raw SQL. To activate high security mode, set it to true in the local .ini configuration file and activate it in the Account Settings in the UI. For more information, see High security. proxy_scheme, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass Type Strings Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variables NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS By default, the Python agent attempts to directly connect to our servers. If there is a firewall between your host and the our collector that requires you to use an HTTP proxy, set proxy_host and proxy_port to the required values for your HTTP proxy. If proxy authentication is implemented by the HTTP proxy, also set proxy_user and proxy_pass. The proxy_scheme setting dictates what protocol scheme is used to talk to the HTTP proxy. When set to http, the agent uses a SSL tunnel through the HTTP proxy for end-to-end encryption. Instead of setting the proxy_scheme, proxy_host and proxy_port settings, you can also set the proxy_host setting to a valid URI for the proxy. Include the scheme, host, and port; for example, http://proxy-host:8000. This also works if you set the details of the HTTP proxy with the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST environment variable. Tip Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending whether ssl is disabled or enabled. If you are upgrading from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the ssl setting for backwards compatibility. As proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme, not setting proxy_scheme may result in a failure. audit_log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG Sets the name of the audit log file. If set, the agent logs details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the collector. This allows you to evaluate the security of the Python agent. Use an absolute path unless you are sure what your app's working directory will be at startup. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. Also ensure your web app's parent user can write to the file. Caution Do not use audit logging on an ongoing basis, especially in a production environment. Because the agent does not truncate or rotate the log file, the log file can grow very quickly. labels (tags) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS Adds tags. Specify name:value separated by a colon :, and separate additional tags with semicolons ;. Two tags Server:One;Data Center:Primary Copy process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. api_key Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_KEY Sets the api_key to be used with newrelic-admin record-deploy. ca_bundle_path Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 4.2.0 and newer. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T We'll record transaction traces when they exceed this threshold. The format is a number of seconds (decimal points allowed). See our glossary entry for apdex_t Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. In addition to configuring attributes for all four destinations with the general attribute settings below, they can also be configured on a per-destination basis. For more information, see Python agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes, and Attribute examples. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. Transaction tracer configuration Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. The agent automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? If enabled, the transaction tracer captures deep information about slow transactions. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Positive float or string (apdex_f) Default apdex_f Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds this threshold, the agent records a transaction trace. Valid values are any positive float, or apdex_f (four times apdex_t). transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default obfuscated Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Record SQL? When the transaction tracer is enabled, the agent can record SQL statements. The recorder has three modes: off (sends no SQL), raw (sends the SQL statement in its original form), and obfuscated (strips out numeric and string literals). Most web frameworks (including Django) parameterize SQL queries so they do not actually contain the values used to fill out the query. If you use raw mode with one of these frameworks, the Python agent will only see the SQL prior to insertion of values. The parametrized SQL will look much like obfuscated mode. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Stack trace threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack traces from SQL calls. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent captures the current stack trace. This is helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate in an application. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable SQL query plans? Determines whether the Python agent will capture query plans for slow SQL queries. Only supported in MySQL and PostgreSQL. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Query plan threshold Queries in transaction traces that exceed this threshold will report slow query data and any available explain plans. Explain plan collection will not happen if transaction_tracer.explain_enabled is false. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.function_trace Type String Default (none) Set in Config file For the specified functions or methods, the agent will capture additional function timing instrumentation. Specify these names in the form module:function or module:class.function. Transaction segment configuration Here are Transaction segment settings available via the agent configuration file. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for segments of transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to segments of transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_segments.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for segments of transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_segments.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Error collector configuration Here are error collector settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable error collection? If enabled, the error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions. error_collector.ignore_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these errors To stop collecting specific errors, set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to ignore. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip Before version 6.4.0 of the agent, this setting was named error_collector.ignore_errors. If your configuration file still uses ignore_errors, update your agent to use ignore_classes. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default 100-102 200-208 226 300-308 404 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these status codes Lists HTTP status codes which the agent should ignore rather than record as errors. List additional status codes as integers separated by spaces, and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To add one of the default codes to your allow list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option can only be set in server-side configuration in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these error class names Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to be expected. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these status codes Prevents specified HTTP status codes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. List status codes as integers separated by spaces and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To negate one of the codes in your list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python Agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless on how this configuration setting (error_collector.attributes.enabled) is set. error_collector.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file If enabled, the error collector captures event data for advanced analytics. For more information, see APM Errors. Browser monitoring settings Here are browser monitoring settings available via the agent configuration file. browser_monitoring.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables browser monitoring. For more information, see Page load timing in Python. Important Before enabling browser monitoring in the config file, enable it in the application settings in the browser monitoring UI. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file For supported Python web frameworks, this setting enables auto-insertion of the browser monitoring JavaScript fragments. browser_monitoring.content_type Type String Default text/html Set in Config file Specify the HTML Content-Type(s) that our browser monitoring agent should auto-instrument. Add additional entries in a space-separated list. Instrument xhtml+xml page responses If you are generating HTML page responses and using the Content-Type of application/xhtml+xml, you can override the allowed content types to list both this content type and the default text/html by using: browser_monitoring.content_type = text/html application/xhtml+xml Copy Important The browser monitoring JavaScript snippet prevents the page from validating as application/xhtml+xml, although the page should load and render in end-user browsers. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data which gets sent to page view events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how the configuration setting (browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled) is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Transaction events settings Here are Transaction events settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip These configuration settings used to be called analytic_events. If your configuration file still uses analytic_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. transaction_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Transaction event data allows the use of additional information such as histograms and percentiles. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_events.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_events.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in transaction events. Note that excluding attributes from transaction events does not exclude from span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events settings Here are custom events settings available via the agent configuration file. custom_insights_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Allow recording of events to the Insights custom events API via record_custom_event(). Datastore tracer settings These datastore tracer settings are available via the agent configuration file: datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are also reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects database name for some database drivers. The database name is reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. Distributed tracing settings Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Python agent version 4.2.0.100 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Settings include: distributed_tracing.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. Span event configuration Span events are collected for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Configuration options include: span_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off whether the Python agent sends spans. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off for all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this configuration setting (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Event harvest configuration Event harvest settings limit the amount of event type data sent to New Relic. When you use these settings, consider these important points: Event harvest settings affect the limits for a single instance of the agent, and not across the entire application. See the usage example below for how to set limits across an entire application. Real time streaming sends data every five seconds (12 times per minute), but the event harvest settings still affect the rate in events per minute. Enabling or disabling real time streaming does not require changing these settings. With real time streaming (enabled by default), New Relic will display the event harvest limits for entities in five second intervals. This means, for example, when you set a limit value of 1200 in the config file, you'll see it as 100 in New Relic. Usage example Let's say an application is deployed across 10 hosts, each running four processes per host. To limit the number of span events to 10,000 events per minute for the entire application, divide that number by 10 hosts. Then divide again by four processes per host. 10000 / (10 * 4) = 250 Based on that calculation, the final setting is: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data = 250 Event harvest configuration settings include: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.analytic_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for analytic events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.custom_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for custom events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Custom events are created through the Python Telemetry SDK. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data Type Integer Default 1000 Set in Config file Limit for span events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.error_event_data Type Integer Default 100 Set in Config file Limit for error events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Event loop visibility settings Important Requires Python agent version 5.0.0.124 or higher. Event loop visibility surfaces information about transactions that block the event loop. The agent will generate information about transactions that have waited a significant amount of time to acquire control of the event loop. Settings include: event_loop_visibility.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Set this to false to disable event loop information. event_loop_visibility.blocking_threshold Type Float Default 0.1 Set in Config file Threshold in seconds for how long a transaction must block the event loop before generating event loop information. Garbage collection runtime metrics settings Important Requires Python agent version 6.2.0.156 or higher. These garbage collection runtime metrics settings are available via the agent configuration file: gc_runtime_metrics.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file When enabled, the agent will generate and send garbage collection metrics. gc_runtime_metrics.top_object_count_limit Type Integer Default 5 Set in Config file The agent reports object count metrics for the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector. For each object type, this setting allows you to set the maximum number of individual metrics that will be sampled. Other configuration settings Here are assorted other settings available via the agent configuration file. utilization.detect_aws Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an AWS environment. utilization.detect_azure Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an Azure environment. utilization.detect_gcp Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Google Cloud Platform environment. utilization.detect_pcf Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment. utilization.detect_docker Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in Docker. slow_sql.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable Slow SQL? If enabled, the agent captures details from long-running SQL database queries. thread_profiler.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable thread profiler? Enables you to schedule thread profiling sessions. The thread profiler will periodically capture a snapshot of the call stack for each active thread in the application to construct a statistically representative call tree. cross_application_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables cross application tracing, which connect your apps and services within your service-oriented architecture. strip_exception_messages.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file If enabled, exception messages will be stripped from error traces before they are sent to the collector, in order to prevent the inadvertent capture of sensitive information. This option is automatically enabled in high security mode. strip_exception_messages.whitelist Type String Default (none) Set in Config file Exceptions listed in your allow list will not have their messages stripped, even if strip_exception_messages.enabled is true. The allow list is a space-separated string of exception types, each in the form of module:exception_name. List built-in exceptions as exception_name; you do not need to prepend module: to them. Example: Built-in exception and user-defined exception KeyError my_module:MyException Copy startup_timeout Type Float Default 0.0 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT By default, the agent starts when it receives the first transaction (either web or non-web). The agent then starts in parallel, ensuring that this initial request is not delayed. However, the agent does not record the details of this initial request because the agent cannot collect data until registration is complete. To override this, you can set a startup timeout in seconds. The agent will then pause the initial transaction and wait for registration to complete. Important Since startup_timeout delays your app start, we recommend only setting a startup timeout for background task queuing systems, not web applications. shutdown_timeout Type Float Default 2.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT On process shutdown, the agent attempts one final upload to the collector. To prevent the agent running indefinitely in case of an issue, the process shuts down normally if the shutdown_timeout threshold is reached. This shutdown can result in data loss, but the agent prioritizes key metric data during the upload process. For background task queuing systems, especially those which run a small number of tasks per process, you may want to increase the shutdown timeout to ensure the agent can upload all data on process shutdown. Tip The agent defaults to a 2.5 second timeout because Apache and many other web servers have a 3.0 second process termination timeout. The agent exits at 2.5 seconds to allow atexit cleanup code registered for the process to run. compressed_content_encoding Type String Default gzip Set in Config file If the data compression threshold is reached in the payload, the agent compresses data, using gzip compression by default. The config option compression_content_encoding can be set to deflate to use deflate compression. Heroku heroku.use_dyno_names Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_USE_DYNO_NAMES If true, the agent uses Heroku dyno names as the hostname. heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten Type Array Default [\"scheduler\", \"run\"] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_DYNO_NAME_PREFIXES_TO_SHORTEN Ordinarily the agent reports dyno names with a trailing dot and process ID (for example, worker.3). You can remove this trailing data by specifying the prefixes you want to report without trailing data (for example, worker). Built-in instrumentation The Python agent instruments a range of Python packages/modules. This instrumentation only occurs when the target Python package/module is imported by an application. To disable default instrumentation, provide a special import-hook section corresponding to the name of the module that triggered instrumentation. Then set the enabled setting to false to disable instrumentation of that module. Example: Disabling MySQLdb database query instrumentation Add the following to the configuration file: [import-hook:MySQLdb] enabled = false Copy",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent default security settings automatically provide security for your data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information we ingest. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

      "body": "Our Python agent lets you change the default agent behavior agent using configuration options. The only required Python agent configuration setting is the license key. The license key identifies the account where the agent reports application data. Depending on how you are hosting your application, the license key can be provided via a configuration file or an environment variable. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Python agent is via the configuration file, which is generated as part of the standard install process. It is also possible to set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI or by using environment variables. You can also specify some settings on a per-request basis by passing settings with the WSGI request environ dictionary. The Python agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: With the Python agent, per-request options override server-side config. If enabled, server-side config overrides all corresponding values in the agent config file, even if the server-side values are left blank. The agent config file overrides environment variables. Environment variables override the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file Typically you configure your Python agent from a local configuration file on the agent's host system. Supply the path to the config file at startup using one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the path to the config file as the first argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you use the newrelic-admin wrapper script, you must use the environment variable because the wrapper script calls the agent automatically. The configuration file uses a structure similar to Microsoft Windows .ini files. For more information, see the Python ConfigParser module's file format documentation. Tip A sample configuration file is included with the Python agent as newrelic/newrelic.ini. You can also generate one from the newrelic-admin script using the generate-config command, or download a copy from our download repo. Server-side configuration Tip Owner or Admins Server-side configuration allows you to configure certain settings in the New Relic One UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. Important If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the config file that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty string and does not use the agent config file. Environment variables Environment variables allow you to override the defaults for certain core settings. If the equivalent setting is explicitly listed in the agent config file, the config file settings take precedence over the environment variable. Where available, environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. For simple configurations, you can use the environment variables in conjunction with server-side configuration and avoid the agent config file altogether. This is the default setup with Heroku, where installing the New Relic add-on automatically populates the necessary environment variables. Environment variable Configuration setting NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY license_key NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME app_name NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE monitor_mode NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE developer_mode NEW_RELIC_LOG log_file NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL log_level NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY high_security NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME proxy_scheme NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST proxy_host NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT proxy_port NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER proxy_user NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS proxy_pass NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG audit_log_file NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT startup_timeout NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT shutdown_timeout NEW_RELIC_LABELS labels NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME process_host.display_name NEW_RELIC_API_KEY api_key NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH ca_bundle_path NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED distributed_tracing.enabled NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG feature_flag Per-request configuration For certain WSGI servers, you can override the app name and capture attributes settings on a per-request basis. This is possible with WSGI servers where you can define additional key/value pairs that are passed into the per-request WSGI environ dictionary. Set these values with the strings on, off, true, false, 1 and 0. If set from a configuration mechanism implemented using Python code, Python objects evaluating to True or False will also be accepted. Example: Apache/mod_wsgi app name In the Apache/mod_wsgi server, you can use the SetEnv directive to override config settings (optionally inside a Location or Directory block). For example, you could override the app name for a complete virtual host, or for a subset of URLs handled by the WSGI application for that virtual host. In addition to being able to override certain agent configuration settings, you can set other per-request configuration settings with their WSGI environment key: newrelic.set_background_task If set to true, this web transaction will instead be reported as a non-web transaction. newrelic.ignore_transaction If set to true, this web transaction will not be reported. newrelic.suppress_apdex_metric If set to true, no Apdex metric will be generated for this web transaction. newrelic.suppress_transaction_trace If set to true, this web transaction cannot be recorded in a transaction trace. newrelic.disable_browser_autorum If set to true, this disables automatic insertion of the JavaScript header/footer for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). Only applicable if auto-insertion is available for your web framework. Important Using a WSGI middleware to set these values will not work where the Python agent's own WSGI application wrapper was applied at an outer scope. In these cases you must make calls to the agent API to achieve the same outcome. Multiple environment configuration The agent reads its primary configuration from an agent config section called newrelic. You can provide overrides for specific deployment environments (for example, Development, Staging, Production) in additional sections. Preface these sections with [newrelic:environment], where environment is replaced with the name of your environment. To specify that the agent should use an environment-based configuration, use one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the environment name as the second argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT environment variable to the environment name. If no environment is specified, the agent will use the default settings as specified in the newrelic agent config section. The basic structure of the configuration file is: [newrelic] ... default settings [newrelic:development] ... override settings [newrelic:staging] ... override settings [newrelic:production] ... override settings Copy General configuration settings These settings are available in the agent configuration file. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Specifies the license key of your New Relic account. This key associates your app's metrics with your New Relic account. app_name (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Type String Default Python Application Set in Per-request option, config file, environment variable Per-request option newrelic.app_name Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic One UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon ;. Do not put a space before the semicolon, which causes the Python config parser to interpret the name as an embedded comment. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent collects performance data about your app and reports this data to our data collector. developer_mode Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE When true, the agent will instrument your web app, but will not send any actual data. In this offline mode, you will not be billed for an active agent. Use developer mode to test new versions of the agent, or test the agent against third-party packages in a developer environment. Offline mode is not a way of running the APM locally, because the metrics the agent collects are not reported anywhere. log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Sets the name of a log file, which is useful for debugging issues with the agent. This is not set by default, since the agent does not know your web app process's parent user or what directories that process has permission to write to. For detailed information, see Python agent logging. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct, and that the user that your web application runs as can write to the file. Tip Use an absolute path unless you are sure what the working directory of your application will be at startup. If you can't write out a log file, you can also use stderr and output to standard error output. This would normally result in output appearing in your web server log. log_level Type String Default info Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages, if you've set the log file location. This log_level will not affect the Python logging module log level. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are critical, error, warning, info, and debug. To report agent issues, the most useful setting is debug. However, debug generates a lot of information very quickly, so do not keep the agent at this level for longer than it takes to reproduce your problem. high_security Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data is sent to us. Enabling high security mode means that request parameters are not collected, and you cannot send raw SQL. To activate high security mode, set it to true in the local .ini configuration file and activate it in the Account Settings in the UI. For more information, see High security. proxy_scheme, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass Type Strings Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variables NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS By default, the Python agent attempts to directly connect to our servers. If there is a firewall between your host and the our collector that requires you to use an HTTP proxy, set proxy_host and proxy_port to the required values for your HTTP proxy. If proxy authentication is implemented by the HTTP proxy, also set proxy_user and proxy_pass. The proxy_scheme setting dictates what protocol scheme is used to talk to the HTTP proxy. When set to http, the agent uses a SSL tunnel through the HTTP proxy for end-to-end encryption. Instead of setting the proxy_scheme, proxy_host and proxy_port settings, you can also set the proxy_host setting to a valid URI for the proxy. Include the scheme, host, and port; for example, http://proxy-host:8000. This also works if you set the details of the HTTP proxy with the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST environment variable. Tip Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending whether ssl is disabled or enabled. If you are upgrading from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the ssl setting for backwards compatibility. As proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme, not setting proxy_scheme may result in a failure. audit_log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG Sets the name of the audit log file. If set, the agent logs details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the collector. This allows you to evaluate the security of the Python agent. Use an absolute path unless you are sure what your app's working directory will be at startup. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. Also ensure your web app's parent user can write to the file. Caution Do not use audit logging on an ongoing basis, especially in a production environment. Because the agent does not truncate or rotate the log file, the log file can grow very quickly. labels (tags) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS Adds tags. Specify name:value separated by a colon :, and separate additional tags with semicolons ;. Two tags Server:One;Data Center:Primary Copy process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. api_key Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_KEY Sets the api_key to be used with newrelic-admin record-deploy. ca_bundle_path Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 4.2.0 and newer. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T We'll record transaction traces when they exceed this threshold. The format is a number of seconds (decimal points allowed). See our glossary entry for apdex_t Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. In addition to configuring attributes for all four destinations with the general attribute settings below, they can also be configured on a per-destination basis. For more information, see Python agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes, and Attribute examples. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. Transaction tracer configuration Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. The agent automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? If enabled, the transaction tracer captures deep information about slow transactions. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Positive float or string (apdex_f) Default apdex_f Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds this threshold, the agent records a transaction trace. Valid values are any positive float, or apdex_f (four times apdex_t). transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default obfuscated Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Record SQL? When the transaction tracer is enabled, the agent can record SQL statements. The recorder has three modes: off (sends no SQL), raw (sends the SQL statement in its original form), and obfuscated (strips out numeric and string literals). Most web frameworks (including Django) parameterize SQL queries so they do not actually contain the values used to fill out the query. If you use raw mode with one of these frameworks, the Python agent will only see the SQL prior to insertion of values. The parametrized SQL will look much like obfuscated mode. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Stack trace threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack traces from SQL calls. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent captures the current stack trace. This is helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate in an application. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable SQL query plans? Determines whether the Python agent will capture query plans for slow SQL queries. Only supported in MySQL and PostgreSQL. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Query plan threshold Queries in transaction traces that exceed this threshold will report slow query data and any available explain plans. Explain plan collection will not happen if transaction_tracer.explain_enabled is false. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.function_trace Type String Default (none) Set in Config file For the specified functions or methods, the agent will capture additional function timing instrumentation. Specify these names in the form module:function or module:class.function. Transaction segment configuration Here are Transaction segment settings available via the agent configuration file. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for segments of transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to segments of transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_segments.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for segments of transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_segments.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Error collector configuration Here are error collector settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable error collection? If enabled, the error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions. error_collector.ignore_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these errors To stop collecting specific errors, set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to ignore. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip Before version 6.4.0 of the agent, this setting was named error_collector.ignore_errors. If your configuration file still uses ignore_errors, update your agent to use ignore_classes. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default 100-102 200-208 226 300-308 404 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these status codes Lists HTTP status codes which the agent should ignore rather than record as errors. List additional status codes as integers separated by spaces, and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To add one of the default codes to your allow list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option can only be set in server-side configuration in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these error class names Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to be expected. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these status codes Prevents specified HTTP status codes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. List status codes as integers separated by spaces and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To negate one of the codes in your list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python Agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless on how this configuration setting (error_collector.attributes.enabled) is set. error_collector.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file If enabled, the error collector captures event data for advanced analytics. For more information, see APM Errors. Browser monitoring settings Here are browser monitoring settings available via the agent configuration file. browser_monitoring.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables browser monitoring. For more information, see Page load timing in Python. Important Before enabling browser monitoring in the config file, enable it in the application settings in the browser monitoring UI. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file For supported Python web frameworks, this setting enables auto-insertion of the browser monitoring JavaScript fragments. browser_monitoring.content_type Type String Default text/html Set in Config file Specify the HTML Content-Type(s) that our browser monitoring agent should auto-instrument. Add additional entries in a space-separated list. Instrument xhtml+xml page responses If you are generating HTML page responses and using the Content-Type of application/xhtml+xml, you can override the allowed content types to list both this content type and the default text/html by using: browser_monitoring.content_type = text/html application/xhtml+xml Copy Important The browser monitoring JavaScript snippet prevents the page from validating as application/xhtml+xml, although the page should load and render in end-user browsers. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data which gets sent to page view events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how the configuration setting (browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled) is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Transaction events settings Here are Transaction events settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip These configuration settings used to be called analytic_events. If your configuration file still uses analytic_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. transaction_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Transaction event data allows the use of additional information such as histograms and percentiles. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_events.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_events.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in transaction events. Note that excluding attributes from transaction events does not exclude from span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events settings Here are custom events settings available via the agent configuration file. custom_insights_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Allow recording of events to the Insights custom events API via record_custom_event(). Datastore tracer settings These datastore tracer settings are available via the agent configuration file: datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are also reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects database name for some database drivers. The database name is reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. Distributed tracing settings Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Python agent version 4.2.0.100 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Settings include: distributed_tracing.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. Span event configuration Span events are collected for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Configuration options include: span_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off whether the Python agent sends spans. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off for all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this configuration setting (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Event harvest configuration Event harvest settings limit the amount of event type data sent to New Relic. When you use these settings, consider these important points: Event harvest settings affect the limits for a single instance of the agent, and not across the entire application. See the usage example below for how to set limits across an entire application. Real time streaming sends data every five seconds (12 times per minute), but the event harvest settings still affect the rate in events per minute. Enabling or disabling real time streaming does not require changing these settings. With real time streaming (enabled by default), New Relic will display the event harvest limits for entities in five second intervals. This means, for example, when you set a limit value of 1200 in the config file, you'll see it as 100 in New Relic. Usage example Let's say an application is deployed across 10 hosts, each running four processes per host. To limit the number of span events to 10,000 events per minute for the entire application, divide that number by 10 hosts. Then divide again by four processes per host. 10000 / (10 * 4) = 250 Based on that calculation, the final setting is: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data = 250 Event harvest configuration settings include: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.analytic_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for analytic events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.custom_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for custom events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Custom events are created through the Python Telemetry SDK. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data Type Integer Default 1000 Set in Config file Limit for span events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.error_event_data Type Integer Default 100 Set in Config file Limit for error events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Event loop visibility settings Important Requires Python agent version 5.0.0.124 or higher. Event loop visibility surfaces information about transactions that block the event loop. The agent will generate information about transactions that have waited a significant amount of time to acquire control of the event loop. Settings include: event_loop_visibility.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Set this to false to disable event loop information. event_loop_visibility.blocking_threshold Type Float Default 0.1 Set in Config file Threshold in seconds for how long a transaction must block the event loop before generating event loop information. Garbage collection runtime metrics settings Important Requires Python agent version 6.2.0.156 or higher. These garbage collection runtime metrics settings are available via the agent configuration file: gc_runtime_metrics.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file When enabled, the agent will generate and send garbage collection metrics. gc_runtime_metrics.top_object_count_limit Type Integer Default 5 Set in Config file The agent reports object count metrics for the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector. For each object type, this setting allows you to set the maximum number of individual metrics that will be sampled. Other configuration settings Here are assorted other settings available via the agent configuration file. utilization.detect_aws Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an AWS environment. utilization.detect_azure Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an Azure environment. utilization.detect_gcp Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Google Cloud Platform environment. utilization.detect_pcf Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment. utilization.detect_docker Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in Docker. slow_sql.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable Slow SQL? If enabled, the agent captures details from long-running SQL database queries. thread_profiler.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable thread profiler? Enables you to schedule thread profiling sessions. The thread profiler will periodically capture a snapshot of the call stack for each active thread in the application to construct a statistically representative call tree. cross_application_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables cross application tracing, which connect your apps and services within your service-oriented architecture. strip_exception_messages.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file If enabled, exception messages will be stripped from error traces before they are sent to the collector, in order to prevent the inadvertent capture of sensitive information. This option is automatically enabled in high security mode. strip_exception_messages.whitelist Type String Default (none) Set in Config file Exceptions listed in your allow list will not have their messages stripped, even if strip_exception_messages.enabled is true. The allow list is a space-separated string of exception types, each in the form of module:exception_name. List built-in exceptions as exception_name; you do not need to prepend module: to them. Example: Built-in exception and user-defined exception KeyError my_module:MyException Copy startup_timeout Type Float Default 0.0 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT By default, the agent starts when it receives the first transaction (either web or non-web). The agent then starts in parallel, ensuring that this initial request is not delayed. However, the agent does not record the details of this initial request because the agent cannot collect data until registration is complete. To override this, you can set a startup timeout in seconds. The agent will then pause the initial transaction and wait for registration to complete. Important Since startup_timeout delays your app start, we recommend only setting a startup timeout for background task queuing systems, not web applications. shutdown_timeout Type Float Default 2.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT On process shutdown, the agent attempts one final upload to the collector. To prevent the agent running indefinitely in case of an issue, the process shuts down normally if the shutdown_timeout threshold is reached. This shutdown can result in data loss, but the agent prioritizes key metric data during the upload process. For background task queuing systems, especially those which run a small number of tasks per process, you may want to increase the shutdown timeout to ensure the agent can upload all data on process shutdown. Tip The agent defaults to a 2.5 second timeout because Apache and many other web servers have a 3.0 second process termination timeout. The agent exits at 2.5 seconds to allow atexit cleanup code registered for the process to run. compressed_content_encoding Type String Default gzip Set in Config file If the data compression threshold is reached in the payload, the agent compresses data, using gzip compression by default. The config option compression_content_encoding can be set to deflate to use deflate compression. Heroku heroku.use_dyno_names Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_USE_DYNO_NAMES If true, the agent uses Heroku dyno names as the hostname. heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten Type Array Default [\"scheduler\", \"run\"] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_DYNO_NAME_PREFIXES_TO_SHORTEN Ordinarily the agent reports dyno names with a trailing dot and process ID (for example, worker.3). You can remove this trailing data by specifying the prefixes you want to report without trailing data (for example, worker). Built-in instrumentation The Python agent instruments a range of Python packages/modules. This instrumentation only occurs when the target Python package/module is imported by an application. To disable default instrumentation, provide a special import-hook section corresponding to the name of the module that triggered instrumentation. Then set the enabled setting to false to disable instrumentation of that module. Example: Disabling MySQLdb database query instrumentation Add the following to the configuration file: [import-hook:MySQLdb] enabled = false Copy",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation allows you to instrument parts of your app that are not instrumented automatically. This document describes how to instrument your app by decorating the methods in your app code with attributes. Use the Transaction attribute to create a custom transaction. You can also mark the custom transaction as a web transaction with the attribute's Web property. Use the Trace attribute to add custom instrumentation to methods that are invoked within a preexisting transaction. Requirements and recommendations Requirements include: .NET agent version 6.16.178.0 or higher. You must be willing to modify your source code. If you cannot or do not want to modify your source code, use custom instrumentation via XML. Your project must have a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll (for example, installing the package and placing using NewRelic.Api.Agent; in your code). This package is in the NuGet gallery. The Transaction and Trace attributes must be applied to concrete implementations of methods. They cannot be applied on interfaces or super class method definitions. Transactions called within transactions Methods decorated with the [Transaction] attribute will only create a new transaction when one does not already exist. When a method decorated with [Transaction] is called from within a previously started transaction, it will be treated as the [Trace] attribute instead, and will provide more information about the existing transaction. Example: Calling Transaction in an already-started transaction During the execution of this console application, OuterMethod will be called first and create a new transaction. The InnerMethod is called from within the transaction started by OuterMethod, so it will not create a new transaction. Instead, information about the execution of InnerMethod will be tracked as if the [Trace] attribute had been applied. static void Main(string[] args) { OuterMethod(); } [Transaction] public void OuterMethod() { InnerMethod(); } [Transaction] public void InnerMethod() { } Copy Create a new non-web transaction To start a non-web transaction (also known as a background request) with the Transaction attribute: [Transaction] public void Run() { // your background task } Copy For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Create a new web transaction To tell the agent to mark a non-web task as a web browser transaction, use either of these options: Set the Web property of the Transaction attribute to true. Set the transaction's URI with SetTransactionUri().

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "You can extend the Python agent's monitoring to trace time spent in additional functions or methods of classes by modifying your configuration file. This form of custom instrumentation is simpler to implement than API calls, and does not require you to modify your code. However, for more complex needs, you may need to implement Python instrumentation by API. Listing functions in the configuration file To extend instrumentation to designated functions and class methods, add them to the transaction_tracer.function_trace setting within the newrelic section of the agent configuration file. The identifier for a function should have the form module:function and that of a class method module:class.function. Using dumbdbm In this example, you use the Python dumbdbm module and want to instrument the time it took to open a database, and then to write that database back to a file. In this case you would use: transaction_tracer.function_trace = dumbdbm:open dumbdbm:_Database._commit Copy To list more than one item, use either of these methods: One line: Separate each item with a space. Multiple lines: Follow the ini file convention to indent the subsequent lines. When data is reported for the instrumented function, the metric will have a name in the form Function/module:function or Function/module:class.function. In the performance breakdown for a transaction, the category will show as Function and the segment will be module:function or module:class.function. For slow transaction traces, only the segment name appears. Note that where a function is actually returning a generator, only the time spent in returning the generator will be recorded and not the consumption of the values from the generator. Restrictions on wrapping extension APIs When wrapping functions by listing them in the agent configuration file, you cannot designate class methods this way when the method is a member of a class which is implemented in C code by a C extension module. This is because it is not possible to modify the method table of a type implemented using the Python C API. Overriding the reported function name When using the transaction_tracer.function_trace setting in the agent configuration file, the name of the function will be used in the metric name, with it being classified as a Function. If it is necessary to override what function name may be used in the metric name or classify it differently, then an alternate means of defining the function trace in the configuration file can be used. The equivalent for: transaction_tracer.function_trace = dumbdbm:open dumbdbm:_Database._commit Copy would be to create two new configuration sections in the agent configuration file, one for each function to be traced: [function-trace:dumbdbm-1] enabled = true function = dumbdbm:open name = dumbdbm:open group = Function [function-trace:dumbdbm-2] enabled = true function = dumbdbm:_Database._commit name = dumbdbm:_Database._commit group = Function Copy The ini file section name should start with function-trace:. The name component that follows that prefix can be anything but should be unique across all function trace sections in the configuration file. The group and name settings can be overridden as necessary to arrive at the desired metric name. The enabled setting defaults to false and needs to be set to true to enable the function trace. Instrument with the API For simple custom instrumentation purposes, the config file method works well. For more precise and customized instrumentation and agent behavior adjustments, you will want to use the Python agent API.",

This document describes how to instrument your app by decorating the methods in your app code with attributes. Use the Transaction attribute to create a custom transaction. You can also mark the custom transaction as a web transaction with the attribute's Web property. Use the Trace attribute to add custom instrumentation to methods that are invoked within a preexisting transaction. Requirements and recommendations Requirements include: .NET agent version 6.16.178.0 or higher. You must be willing to modify your source code. If you cannot or do not want to modify your source code, use custom instrumentation via XML. Your project must have a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll (for example, installing the package and placing using NewRelic.Api.Agent; in your code). This package is in the NuGet gallery. The Transaction and Trace attributes must be applied to concrete implementations of methods. They cannot be applied on interfaces or super class method definitions. Transactions called within transactions Methods decorated with the [Transaction] attribute will only create a new transaction when one does not already exist.
