      "body": "Problem If you have encountered any of these common problems after installing your New Relic Node.js agent, try these troubleshooting tips. Solution Some common problems users encounter after installing the New Relic Node.js agent include: Not seeing data To minimize the amount of bandwidth the Node.js agent consumes, New Relic only reports data once per minute. If you add the agent to tests that take less than a minute to run, it will not have time to report data to New Relic. If you do not see transaction traces or other data after deploying the agent, this may be due to configuration, framework, or Apdex settings. Use New Relic Diagnostics to try to automatically identify the issue. Installation problems What to check Comments Main module Ensure that you have added require('newrelic'); as the first line of the app's main module. If the require is added later, the Node.js agent may not properly instrument your application. Conditional logic If you have any conditional logic in your require, move the conditional logic to your newrelic.js configuration file. Frameworks For problems with supported frameworks, make sure you are using Connect, Express, Hapi, Kraken, or Restify. There are other Node.js frameworks, but New Relic does not support all of them. Apdex For problems with your Apdex results, try adjusting your Apdex score via your Node.js agent config file (newrelic.js) or the New Relic user interface. Log files The Node.js agent writes its log to the newrelic_agent.log file in the application directory, unless you have changed the logging settings. If the agent does not send data or crashes your app, you can generate a troubleshooting log file to accompany bug reports and support requests. Missing VM metrics The agent can collect VM metrics related to garbage collection (GC), memory, and CPU. Some of these metrics require an additional native module to be installed. Here are some common problems and their solutions: Problem During installation, npm shows one of the following error messages: gyp ERR! configure error gyp ERR! stack Error: Can't find Python executable \"python\", you can set the PYTHON env variable. Copy gyp ERR! build error gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make Copy make: g++: Command not found Copy Solution Ensure that the prerequisites for the node-gyp module are installed. On Debian/Ubuntu platforms, use this command: apt-get install build-essential Copy For more information, see Node.js VM measurements.

Here are some additional tips for Node.js. Solution Error codes will automatically appear in the site source code and in your Node.js agent logs. Search for NREUM to find these codes. Error code Description 0 Browser monitoring has been explicitly disabled. This was done either in the newrelic.js or with an environment variable. (NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE defaults to true.) 1 The browser agent was called outside of a web transaction. This may occur if you tried to generate the browser data once and then cache it, or if you called it in a background task. 2 Something unexpected occurred. 3 The transaction is unnamed. If you are not using Express or Restify and you did not explicitly name the transaction, this error appears. This is to avoid rolling the transaction name into / *. For more information, see naming your transactions. 4 The Node.js agent has not yet done a \"handshake\" with the collector. The app was started and a user hit the site before the collector could talk to the agent. This may occur because: The browser page loaded before the agent made its initial connection to New Relic. The license key is invalid. Some other problem occurred that would prevent the application ID from being available. If these errors persist longer than 1 minute, check your license key. Otherwise, the errors should disappear on their own. 5 Browser monitoring has been disabled on the collector side. For example, the collector did not return enough data for browser monitoring to be enabled. This is a collector issue, because some server-side configuration settings for Node.js currently are not available.",

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding.

      "body": "With our Go agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. Here we explain how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and give an example of deploying a Go app with Docker. Important The Go agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the Go agent, building a custom Go runtime for Docker, and deploying a golang application. For more information about deploying and configuring your Go app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Go Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Go app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Go agent for your specific app server, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Go to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, download and install git, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. The following Dockerfile example code defines the golang version used. FROM golang:1.8-onbuild CMD go run main.go Copy 4. Build a Docker image To build the Docker image, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build --rm -t Docker-image-name . Copy 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project go-app-name app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see GAE's documentation for debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Go agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.yml file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy",

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using Full-Stack Observability options like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data.

If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

Avoid creating lists of doc links in the For more help section, because it is harder for future writers to determine why they matter. Tip If you're linking to the product, see our style guide page on UI paths. Link text Follow these guidelines when writing text for hyperlinks: Labels: Make sure each link in the document has a unique, meaningful text label. Do not use the same text string to label different links. Location: Include a clear, concise text label to identify where the link goes. Give extra context if you're linking to an external site. Why are you sending someone there? Click here: Do not use \"click here\" or other meaningless link labels. \"Link test:\" Read just the links, without the surrounding text. Can each stand alone as a clear description of where the link goes if that is all the user looks at on the page? Avoid URL prefixes: If you're sending users to an address where you want to use the URL as the link text, drop the https: and www. prefixes from the link text. For example, [github.com](https://github.com) not [https://github.com/](https://github.com). Or [github.com/newrelic/docs-website](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/) not [https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/). Take the link test for these three examples. The last is the best for readers looking for information on configuring PHP, because the link clearly identifies it, without having to read anything else on the page. Quality \"Link test\" example Bad To learn more about renaming your PHP app, click here. Okay To learn more about renaming your PHP app, see New Relic's config docs. Good To learn more about renaming your PHP app, use the PHP agent (newrelic.ini) settings. Support links Never include a hyperlink to the Support email address. This prevents spam and ensures customers use the ticket submission form to create tickets so they receive the correct support priority. If you need to tell customers to contact support, use this instead: Get support at [support.newrelic.com](support.newrelic.com). Copy Docs site (\"internal\") links When creating links to other documents on the Docs site, include only the path from /docs forward. Do not include https://docs.newrelic.com, or the site will treat it as an external link. Here is an example: [/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-newrelic-ini-settings](PHP agent (newrelic.ini) settings Copy Anchor links If your link includes an anchor (for example, #inivar-scope), use the complete, current doc path it uses. Some browsers do not retain anchors with redirects. When creating or editing an HTML id for an anchor link, follow these guidelines: Only use lower case when creating new IDs. Use hyphens - to separate words. Don't use _ underscores. When reorganizing a doc, try to preserve incoming anchor links where possible. Be mindful that when you delete a level two heading ##, it will break any links to that heading. Avoid changing an existing anchor ID, because we may be monitoring traffic to it from our internal New Relic account. External links When creating links to websites outside the docs.newrelic.com subdomain (including newrelic.com, one.newrelic.com, discuss.newrelic.com), the Docs site automatically includes code that opens the link in a new tab. In addition to the link text guidelines in this doc, here are some other things to keep in mind when linking to external sites: Think about the best way to future-proof your links. If possible, point to a top-level domain, but not if it reduces the usefulness of the link. How stable is the content you're linking to? Is the URL likely to change? Make sure your link is as useful as possible. What value are you trying to add to the document? Can that information be shared in another way? Help the reader understand why you're linking to this external source. Is it a useful reference, such as a list of time zones? Is it a way to save someone time, such as linking directly to a hard-to-find file? Make sure that your link is generally accessible. Are you linking to an external site that requires authentication, such as a private GitHub repo? Linking to an arbitrary (non-heading, non-collapser-entry) section in a doc H2 and H3 headings and collapsers have their own built-in IDs that you can link to. But sometimes you may want to link to a paragraph or to a table entry. In general, avoid this, and instead, link to headings and collapsers. Occasionally it's useful to link to a specific entry in a table, or a very important paragraph in a conceptual explanation. To do that, place a <span> tag around some text, using this format: <span id=\"name\">your text</span> Copy And then link to it using the standard anchor link format.",

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

For a more flexible method to create key/value pairs, use newrelic_add_custom_parameter. As of release 4.4, calling newrelic_set_user_attributes(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"); is equivalent to calling newrelic_add_custom_parameter(\"user\", \"a\"); newrelic_add_custom_parameter(\"account\", \"b\"); newrelic_add_custom_parameter(\"product\", \"c\"); All three parameters are required, but they may be empty strings. Parameters Parameter Description $user_value string Required (can be empty string). Specify a name or username to associate with this page view. This value is assigned to the user key. $account_value string Required (can be empty string). Specify the name of a user account to associate with this page view. This value is assigned to the account key. $product_value string Required (can be empty string). Specify the name of a product to associate with this page view. This value is assigned to the product key. Return values This function will return true if the attributes were added successfully.

For a more flexible method to create key/value pairs, use newrelic_add_custom_parameter. As of release 4.4, calling newrelic_set_user_attributes(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"); is equivalent to calling newrelic_add_custom_parameter(\"user\", \"a\"); newrelic_add_custom_parameter(\"account\", \"b\"); newrelic_add_custom_parameter(\"product\", \"c\"); All three parameters are required, but they may be empty strings. Parameters Parameter Description $user_value string Required (can be empty string). Specify a name or username to associate with this page view. This value is assigned to the user key. $account_value string Required (can be empty string). Specify the name of a user account to associate with this page view. This value is assigned to the account key. $product_value string Required (can be empty string). Specify the name of a product to associate with this page view.

This also includes a summary of the PHP agent properties that have been deprecated with the release of New Relic agent attributes. Properties Use the following destination properties to open or close the destination to any attribute collection: newrelic.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes in all destinations. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: False Turns on or turns off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data that gets attached to page view events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to browser monitoring regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for traced errors. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for transaction traces.

Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

Restart the agent and its daemon for changes to take effect. Capture request parameters By default, the agent does not capture request parameters.

If you want to limit the destinations that you capture parameters for, see Selecting specific destinations. Configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* Copy Capture only specific request parameters To capture only specific request parameters, you can pass a list to attributes.include: Configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.user_id request.parameters.product_id Copy Disabling all attributes In this example, attributes are disabled, so the include and exclude lists will be ignored and all attributes will be filtered out.

The include and exclude lists will be ignored, and all attributes will be filtered out for this destination. Attributes are also disabled for browser monitoring by default.

For a more flexible method to create key/value pairs, use newrelic_add_custom_parameter. As of release 4.4, calling newrelic_set_user_attributes(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"); is equivalent to calling newrelic_add_custom_parameter(\"user\", \"a\"); newrelic_add_custom_parameter(\"account\", \"b\"); newrelic_add_custom_parameter(\"product\", \"c\"); All three parameters are required, but they may be empty strings. Parameters Parameter Description $user_value string Required (can be empty string). Specify a name or username to associate with this page view. This value is assigned to the user key. $account_value string Required (can be empty string). Specify the name of a user account to associate with this page view. This value is assigned to the account key. $product_value string Required (can be empty string). Specify the name of a product to associate with this page view.

Avoid creating lists of doc links in the For more help section, because it is harder for future writers to determine why they matter. Tip If you're linking to the product, see our style guide page on UI paths. Link text Follow these guidelines when writing text for hyperlinks: Labels: Make sure each link in the document has a unique, meaningful text label. Do not use the same text string to label different links. Location: Include a clear, concise text label to identify where the link goes. Give extra context if you're linking to an external site. Why are you sending someone there? Click here: Do not use \"click here\" or other meaningless link labels. \"Link test:\" Read just the links, without the surrounding text. Can each stand alone as a clear description of where the link goes if that is all the user looks at on the page? Avoid URL prefixes: If you're sending users to an address where you want to use the URL as the link text, drop the https: and www. prefixes from the link text. For example, [github.com](https://github.com) not [https://github.com/](https://github.com). Or [github.com/newrelic/docs-website](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/) not [https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/). Take the link test for these three examples. The last is the best for readers looking for information on configuring PHP, because the link clearly identifies it, without having to read anything else on the page. Quality \"Link test\" example Bad To learn more about renaming your PHP app, click here. Okay To learn more about renaming your PHP app, see New Relic's config docs. Good To learn more about renaming your PHP app, use the PHP agent (newrelic.ini) settings. Support links Never include a hyperlink to the Support email address. This prevents spam and ensures customers use the ticket submission form to create tickets so they receive the correct support priority. If you need to tell customers to contact support, use this instead: Get support at [support.newrelic.com](support.newrelic.com). Copy Docs site (\"internal\") links When creating links to other documents on the Docs site, include only the path from /docs forward. Do not include https://docs.newrelic.com, or the site will treat it as an external link. Here is an example: [/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-newrelic-ini-settings](PHP agent (newrelic.ini) settings Copy Anchor links If your link includes an anchor (for example, #inivar-scope), use the complete, current doc path it uses. Some browsers do not retain anchors with redirects. When creating or editing an HTML id for an anchor link, follow these guidelines: Only use lower case when creating new IDs. Use hyphens - to separate words. Don't use _ underscores. When reorganizing a doc, try to preserve incoming anchor links where possible. Be mindful that when you delete a level two heading ##, it will break any links to that heading. Avoid changing an existing anchor ID, because we may be monitoring traffic to it from our internal New Relic account. External links When creating links to websites outside the docs.newrelic.com subdomain (including newrelic.com, one.newrelic.com, discuss.newrelic.com), the Docs site automatically includes code that opens the link in a new tab. In addition to the link text guidelines in this doc, here are some other things to keep in mind when linking to external sites: Think about the best way to future-proof your links. If possible, point to a top-level domain, but not if it reduces the usefulness of the link. How stable is the content you're linking to? Is the URL likely to change? Make sure your link is as useful as possible. What value are you trying to add to the document? Can that information be shared in another way? Help the reader understand why you're linking to this external source. Is it a useful reference, such as a list of time zones? Is it a way to save someone time, such as linking directly to a hard-to-find file? Make sure that your link is generally accessible. Are you linking to an external site that requires authentication, such as a private GitHub repo? Linking to an arbitrary (non-heading, non-collapser-entry) section in a doc H2 and H3 headings and collapsers have their own built-in IDs that you can link to. But sometimes you may want to link to a paragraph or to a table entry. In general, avoid this, and instead, link to headings and collapsers. Occasionally it's useful to link to a specific entry in a table, or a very important paragraph in a conceptual explanation. To do that, place a <span> tag around some text, using this format: <span id=\"name\">your text</span> Copy And then link to it using the standard anchor link format.",

      "body": "Our PHP agent has a number of settings to fine-tune the types and amounts of data reported. For most users, the default values produce the best possible mix of overhead and utility. However, you can change the settings for your specific needs. Important Always restart your web server after changing INI settings. Otherwise, they may not take effect immediately. Configuration order of precedence Here is a simple illustration of the order of precedence that the PHP agent follows for configuration. Server-side configuration is not applicable. The only values you can change in the UI for apps using the PHP agent are the app's alias and its Apdex-T value. With New Relic's PHP agent, API settings override per-directory configuration settings. Per-directory settings override the php.ini file settings. Server-side configuration is not applicable. Configuration file variables During installation, the newrelic-install script provides information about the configuration files it created or a list of files you need to edit. By default it will attempt to create a configuration file named newrelic.ini. In some cases, you may be instructed to add configuration options to your php.ini file. Only do this if necessary. Exactly which file you need to edit depends on how your particular version (or versions) of PHP were configured. The two most common configurations are: Use a single newrelic.ini file. This is usually the default if you have installed or compiled PHP yourself with no special options. Scan a given directory for all .ini files. If you are unsure which file to edit: From the command line, review the output of php -i. In a browser, review the output of a page containing the script: <?php phpinfo(); ?> Copy If the newrelic.ini file appears, use it. Variable scope Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined scope. The scope controls where the setting can be established or modified. The two scopes supported for New Relic settings are: SYSTEM: Values set globally in the global newrelic.ini file. PERDIR: Values set on a per-directory basis. Each can also be set at a more general level. Valid locations for each are: Can be set for: SYSTEM PERDIR Set in the global newrelic.ini file. Set on a per-directory basis. Important You cannot use ini_set() for New Relic settings. Variable type Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined type. The type specifies the syntax for the value you use. Variable type Formatting and contents String String values can contain any alphanumeric character and punctuation. The value is delimited by quotes. Boolean A logical true or false setting. Valid values are: For true or enabled: on, true, the number 1. For false or disabled: off, false, the number 0. Number Numeric values can only contain digits, plus a period to indicate floats. Unless otherwise stated, all numbers are integers, not floats. Duration A string value delimited by quotes that represent a time duration. Use character flags to delimit time components. If there are no flags, the time is in milliseconds. w\\ = weeks d\\ = days h\\ = hours m\\ = minutes s\\ = seconds ms\\ = milliseconds us\\ = microseconds Example durations: \"1w3d23h10m\"\\ = 1 week, 3 days, 23 hours, and 10 minutes \"5h30m\"\\ = 5 hours and 30 minutes \"500\"\\ = 500 milliseconds General configuration settings These settings are available in the newrelic.ini file. newrelic.appname (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"PHP Application\" This config option sets the application name that data is reported under in APM. We highly recommends that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in New Relic, so set this carefully. For all application-naming options, including per-directory settings, see Name your PHP application. The setting's value is a semicolon-separated list of up to three application names. The first name in the list is the primary application name. It must be unique for each account. The application name is used as a key into a cache. When using multiple names for an app, New Relic only uses the first name for caching. Therefore, each application name can only appear as the first element once. Caching example If you set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App2\" and later in the code set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App3\", the second one will appear not to work. It will report to App1 and App2 because of the caching. If you need overlapping application names, set the common application name in the second or third positions. For example: newrelic.appname=\"App2;App1\" and newrelic.appname=\"App3;App1\". This is useful, for example, when you want to track a superset of applications. newrelic.capture_params Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. To set this value programmatically, use the newrelic_capture_params() API function. If you pass sensitive information directly in the URL, keep this disabled. If set to true, this will enable the recording of parameters passed to a PHP script via the URL (everything after the ? in the URL) in transaction traces. These will appear under the Parameters dropdown when displaying transaction traces. newrelic.framework Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: (auto-detected) The New Relic PHP agent automatically detects the frameworks it supports, but problems may arise if you are using experimental new versions or if you have customized the framework. This setting disables automatic framework detection, instead telling the agent to attempt to name transactions according to the specified framework. Specifying \"no_framework\" will disable framework-related transaction naming entirely. Use any of the following values, as appropriate: \"cakephp\" \"codeigniter\" \"drupal\" (for Drupal 6 and 7) \"drupal8\" \"joomla\" \"kohana\" \"laravel\" \"magento\" \"magento2\" \"mediawiki\" \"silex\" \"symfony1\" \"symfony2\" (for Symfony 2 and 3) \"symfony4\" \"wordpress\" \"yii\" \"zend\" \"zend2\" (for Zend Framework 2 and 3) \"no_framework\" (to force no framework even if one was detected) If the framework auto-detection fails, this command will also fail. newrelic.ignored_params Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. Use the newrelic.ignored_params setting to specify a comma-separated list of parameter names to be excluded from the list of parameters sent to the New Relic servers. Enclose the string values with quote marks. If you enable parameter capturing with newrelic.capture_params, there may be parameters with sensitive user data you do not want to be captured by New Relic or visible in transaction traces. Use this to block the recording of this data. newrelic.license (REQUIRED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Notes: Introduced in agent version 3.0. Sets the New Relic license key to use. In a multi-tenant system this can be set on a per-directory basis. Tip When you upgrade from an old agent version to 3.0 or higher, the license will be removed from your daemon configuration file (with a comment explaining why) and stored in the file /etc/newrelic/upgrade_please.key. Copy the license out of that file and set it in your newrelic.ini file. Delete the upgrade_please.key file. newrelic.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the level of detail of messages sent to the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, include: error warning info verbose debug verbosedebug When reporting any agent issues to New Relic technical support, verbosedebug is the most useful setting. However, this can generate a lot of information very quickly, so avoid keeping the agent at verbosedebug level for longer than it takes to reproduce the problem you are experiencing. When reporting any agent issues to New Relic Technical Support, you may be asked to set this to a custom level, enabling debugging only for certain subsystems. Custom levels are beyond the scope of this document. newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 1 Notes: This used to be newrelic.transaction_tracer.top100. Sets the level of detail in a transaction trace: When set to 1, all server calls are traced. When set to 0, traces only include internally instrumented calls by New Relic and those defined by the user using newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom. The default level of 1 does have a performance impact. If you need to improve performance, try setting the detail level to 0. When not tracing all server calls, blocks of time in transaction traces will be labeled as uninstrumented time, and only certain functions (defined internally by the agent) are instrumented. Even when reporting all calls, there may be uninstrumented time in the traces. newrelic.high_security Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables high security for all applications. When high security is set to true, the following behaviors take effect: Data will not be sent to New Relic unless the newrelic-daemon is using a secure connection (HTTPS). If the PHP process spawns a newrelic-daemon, it will be configured to use HTTPS regardless of the value of newrelic.daemon.ssl. Raw query strings will never be gathered, regardless of the value of newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql. Request attributes will never be captured, regardless of the newrelic.attributes configuration settings. The newrelic_add_custom_parameter and newrelic_set_user_attributes API function will have no effect, and they will return false. The newrelic_record_custom_event API function will not submit any events to New Relic. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Caution If you change the newrelic.high_security setting, you must also change the security setting in the APM user interface. If the two settings do not match, then no data will be collected. For more information, see High security. newrelic.labels Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Adds tags. Example tags \"Server:One;Data Center:Primary\" Copy newrelic.process_host.display_name Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. Daemon .ini settings The values of these settings control the daemon startup. When the agent detects that the daemon needs to be started, it will convert these options into the appropriate command line options for the daemon. All of these settings mirror the settings in the newrelic.cfg file. They are repeated here to keep all of the .ini settings in one place. Each setting in newrelic.cfg has its counterpart here, with newrelic.daemon. as the prefix. For example, the ssl setting in newrelic.cfg is newrelic.daemon.ssl in an .ini file. Important If the file /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent ignores these settings, and the agent will not start the daemon automatically. For more information about ways to start the daemon and when to use an external configuration file, see PHP daemon startup modes. newrelic.daemon.app_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"5m\" or \"1h20m\" Default: \"10m\" Sets the elapsed time after which an application will be considered inactive. Inactive applications do not count against the maximum limit of 250 applications. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". A value of 0 will be interpreted as \"no timeout.\" This will result in new applications always counting towards the 250 application limit, as well as the daemon being unable to release a small amount of memory per application back to the operating system. Recommendation: Do not use this value unless New Relic Support requests it. Instead, for occasional background transactions, use a value of twice the interval. For example, for an hourly background job, set the timeout to 2 hours. newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon connecting an application. A value of 0 causes the agent to only make one attempt at connecting to the daemon. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". With this timeout set, the agent will not immediately drop a transaction when the daemon hasn't connected to the backend yet, but rather grant the daemon time to establish the connection. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 15s. Only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of connection problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. newrelic.daemon.auditlog Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" The setting specifies the name of an audit log, which will contain all of the data sent from the daemon to the New Relic servers, including the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, unencoded data for each request. This file cannot be the same file as the daemon log. Important This audit log can become very large, very quickly. Avoid using the newrelic.daemon.auditlog setting for extended periods of time. Its primary purpose is to allow system administrators to perform security reviews and to observe exactly what data transmits. newrelic.daemon.collector_host Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"collector.newrelic.com\" Sets the name and optional port of the collector host which the daemon will contact to verify your license key and send agent data. This is either just the name of the host or the name and port number in the form \"hostname:port\". Specifying a port number of 0 will use the default port, which is 80. Caution Do not change this value without guidance from New Relic Support. newrelic.daemon.dont_launch Scope: SYSTEM Type: Number Default: 0 If you prefer to have the daemon launched externally before the agent starts up, this value determines when the agent is allowed to start the daemon: 0: No restrictions are placed on daemon startup and the agent can start the daemon any time. 1: Non-command line (such as Apache or php-fpm) agents can start the daemon. 2: Only command line agents can start the daemon. 3: The agent will never start the daemon. Use this setting if you are configuring the daemon via newrelic.cfg and starting it outside of the agent. Important If /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent assumes the daemon is meant to be started by its startup script, not via the agent. This setting has no meaning to and does not appear in newrelic.cfg. newrelic.daemon.location Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/usr/bin/newrelic-daemon\" Sets the name of the daemon executable to launch. This variable identifies the full path to the daemon executable file. If the New Relic system was installed using the standard packages, the default location will be correct. If you have installed to a custom location using the tar distribution (and do not have permission to write to /usr/bin), then the daemon may reside at another location. This setting does not appear in the newrelic.cfg file as it is only relevant to PHP. Important On OpenSolaris, /usr is frequently a read-only file system. The default daemon location for OpenSolaris is /opt/newrelic/bin/newrelic-daemon. newrelic.daemon.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log\" Sets the name of the log file to record daemon specific log messages. This file must be writable by the daemon. The most common case is that the Apache user will end up starting the daemon when Apache itself starts up, thus you should ensure that the file is writable by whichever user runs the Apache process. Caution If the daemon log file is not writable, the daemon will not start automatically, which will prevent data from reporting. You can use write permissions to this file as a means of restricting who can start the daemon. newrelic.daemon.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the detail level for messages recorded to New Relic's daemon log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: error warning info debug The more verbose settings can generate a lot of information very quickly. When necessary, set debug for short periods of time to identify problems. newrelic.daemon.pidfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: (depends on OS) Sets the name of the file in which the daemon will record its process ID (pid). This file is used by the daemon startup and shutdown script to determine whether or not the daemon is already running. newrelic.daemon.address (alias for newrelic.daemon.port) Scope: SYSTEM Type: String or Number Default: \"@newrelic\" on Linux, \"/tmp/.newrelic.sock\" otherwise Tip From v9.2.0.247, the PHP agent supports a new setting, newrelic.daemon.address,which serves as an alias to newrelic.daemon.port. You can use either to specify the location of the New Relic PHP daemon. If both values are set, newrelic.daemon.address takes precedence. Sets the socket endpoint for agent to daemon communications. This can be specified in four ways. To use a specified file as a UNIX domain socket (UDS), provide an absolute path name as a string. This is the default on non-Linux systems. To use a standard TCP port, specify a number in the range 1 to 65534. To use an abstract socket, use the value @newrelic-daemon (available for agent version 5.2.0.141 or higher). This is the default on Linux systems. To connect to a daemon that is running on a different host (helpful for container environments), set this value to host:port, where host denotes either a host name or an IP, and port denotes a valid port number. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is available for agent version 9.2.0.247 or higher. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon (this only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts). If you use port numbers, Unix systems require that ports in the range 1 to 1023 require the daemon be run as the super-user. In case the daemon uses a non-standard port, this variable also sets the port number the agent will use for communicating with the daemon. Important If you're using the newrelic.cfg startup mechanism for the daemon, this setting and the address setting in that file must match. newrelic.daemon.proxy Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the host and user credentials to use as an egress proxy. This is only used if your site requires a proxy in order to access the New Relic data collection servers. It can take any of the following forms, depending on the proxy setup: hostname hostname:port user@hostname user@hostname:port user:password@hostname user:password@hostname:port proxytype://user:password@hostname:port A proxy type of HTTP is assumed unless another proxytype is specified. In that case, proxytype can be one of http, socks4, socks4a, or socks5. newrelic.daemon.ssl Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true This setting is ignored on PHP agent versions 8.0 and higher, and HTTPS will always be used to communicate with New Relic. On versions of the PHP agent versions lower than 8.0, controls whether or not communication with New Relic collectors should use a secure HTTP connection. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA bundle. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path is also set, the certificates in this file will be searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA path. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle is also set, it will be searched first followed by the certificates contained in newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.start_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon to start after a daemon launch was triggered. A value of 0 causes the agent to not wait. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\" and \"h\". The specified timeout value will be passed to the daemon via the --wait-for-port flag. This causes daemon startup to block until a socket is acquired or until the timeout is elapsed. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 2s to 5s. It is recommended to only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of daemon start problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. Transaction tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Set this to a comma-separated list of user defined functions or methods to instrument: \"myfunction,myclass::method,otherfunction\" Copy Internal PHP functions cannot have custom tracing. You can add to the list of custom functions with each PERDIR file, but you cannot remove a function or method that has already been added. If you want to programmatically add functions or methods to be instrumented, use the newrelic_add_custom_tracer() API function call. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables the transaction tracer. The tracer creates a detailed transaction trace for transactions that take more time than the threshold, as set by the newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold value. Only one transaction trace per application per harvest cycle is stored and it is always the slowest transaction during that cycle. Transaction traces are useful for diagnosing why a particular transaction was slow. Unless memory and performance are critical, they should almost never be disabled. Enabling this does have a very slight performance impact and does use more memory. For more information, see newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables requesting explain plans from MySQLi and PDO MySQL libraries for slow query calls. Explain plans will only be available when newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql is set to true and newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is not set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" Sets the threshold beyond which queries are considered \"slow\" and thus candidates for the Slow Queries page. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.internal_functions_enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables or disables support for tracing internal functions (that is, functions written in C and provided either via the PHP standard library or PECL extensions). When enabled, internal functions appear in transaction traces like functions written in PHP. Enabling this option may result in transactions being slower, especially when collecting many traces from PHP 5.x. Enabling this option is only recommended when specifically debugging performance issues where an internal function is suspected to be slow. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"obfuscated\" Sets how queries are recorded (if at all). When recording transaction traces internally, the full query for slow query calls is recorded. Sending this query to New Relic can have serious security implications, so by default, all database statements are obfuscated before being sent to New Relic. The obfuscation is not reversible, as it replaces strings and numbers in any query with question marks. The only things that survive intact are field names, not any of their values. If you are testing with data that is not sensitive and you need to see the raw queries in transaction traces, set this to \"raw\". If you do not want queries recorded at all, set this to \"off\". Important Always set this back to \"obfuscated\" or \"off\" in any production environment. newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable the Slow Queries feature. When enabled, it will: Record the top 10 slowest database queries per application per minute. Create a stack trace leading up to the query. If this variable is set to false or SQL recording is disabled, the New Relic agent does not gather any slow query data. newrelic.transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" This sets the threshold above which the agent will record the full PHP stack for transaction traces for which queries are being recorded. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" Stack traces can consume memory, so be careful of setting this value too low. This variable has no meaning if newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"apdex_f\" Use this variable to set the threshold beyond which transactions are eligible for being traced. Available values include: Use \"apdex_f\" to set the threshold to 4 times the application's apdex_t value. For more information, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. Use any other duration string to set a specific time threshold. Specify the duration as an absolute value and the unit of measurement. If none is specified, the unit defaults to millisecond. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.gather_input_queries Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable gathering of DQL input queries with Slow Queries and Transaction Traces. When enabled, these will appear along with slow queries and transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 0 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for web transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP web processes; it will not effect PHP CLI processes. To set a limit for CLI processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 100000 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for CLI transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP CLI processes; it will not effect PHP web processes. To set a limit for web processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web. Other tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control various tracer features. newrelic.cross_application_tracer.enabled Important A distributed tracing feature is available. Distributed tracing improves on cross application tracing and is recommended for monitoring activity in complex distributed systems. Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the cross application tracer. The cross application tracer inserts HTTP headers into outbound requests and the response in order to link together web transaction metrics and transaction traces between applications. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the PHP agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross-application tracing. Before enabling, read the transition guide to understand effects on New Relic features. Enable or disable distributed tracing. When the agent's transaction tracer and distributed tracing features are enabled, the agent will insert headers into outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic distributed tracing header that is attached to outbound requests, and to instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are attached to outbound requests. The New Relic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that do not support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over New Relic headers for distributed tracing. newrelic.span_events_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Span event reporting requires distributed tracing to be enabled. This option enables/disables the reporting of span events. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: \"\" Configures the Trace Observer used for Infinite Tracing. If empty, Infinite Tracing support will be disabled. This requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer Default: 443 Configures the TCP/IP port used to communicate with the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. This setting is ignored if newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host is empty. This setting will not usually need to be changed. newrelic.infinite_tracing.span_events.queue_size Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer (1000 or higher) Default: 100000 Sets the number of span events that can be queued for transmission to the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. The agent internally manages span events for Infinite Tracing in span batches. Those span batches can hold a maximum of 1000 spans. Therefore, the span events queue size cannot be lower than 1000, as otherwise not even a single span batch can be queued. If a queue size lower than 1000 is specified, the minimum size of 1000 is used. newrelic.error_collector.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the error collector. When enabled, the agent collects and reports PHP errors to the New Relic UI. The agent records only the single most severe error for each transaction, and up to 20 errors per harvest cycle. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. newrelic.error_collector.record_database_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When enabled, the agent collects errors returned by MySQL functions as if they were PHP errors. newrelic.error_collector.prioritize_api_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to assign the highest priority to errors identified through the newrelic_notice_error() API function. newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) A comma separated list of fully-qualified exception class names that the agent should ignore. When an unhandled exception occurs, the agent will perform the equivalent of $exception instanceof Class for each of the classes listed. If any of those checks returns true, the agent will not record an exception. Depending on the supported PHP release, these values are equivalent to disabling exception reporting: Supported PHP 5 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Exceptions Supported PHP 7 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Throwable newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer or a bitwise expression of PHP-defined error constants Default: 0 Sets the error levels for the PHP agent to ignore. The value for this setting uses similar syntax to PHP's error_reporting option. For example, to configure the PHP agent to ignore E_WARNING and E_ERROR level errors, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_WARNING | E_ERROR or newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = 3 To configure the PHP agent to ignore everything but E_WARNING, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_ALL & ~E_WARNING newrelic.framework.drupal.modules Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: In agents prior to version 3.0 the default for this value was false. Setting this option implied newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail = 1. To enable Drupal module tracking, set this to true. This option has the same performance impact as newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. It will enable the recording of Drupal module functions and call counts, and they will display under the Modules tab, much like web transactions. newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true To enable WordPress hook tracking, set this to true. It will enable the recording of WordPress hooks, plugins, and themes, and they will display under the WordPress tab in the New Relic UI. newrelic.webtransaction.name.files Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" This is the same as newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions, except it uses file names to name the web transaction. The file names can be standard POSIX regular expression to be used with PCRE; for example, \"controllers/actions/.*\". newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Unless the New Relic agent detects a specific framework, such as Drupal or Wordpress, web transactions are named after the initial PHP file; for example, article.php. When the initial file is a dispatcher, this naming scheme produces less than useful data. Use this variable to specify a list of functions that are the \"actions\" generated by the dispatcher. The name of the web transaction will be the first action function executed. Example dispatch function naming If index.php dispatches to functions named: login, logout, admin, show, and edit You would set this value to \"login,logout,admin,show,edit\". The web transactions will be named login, logout, etc. instead of /index.php (the initial file name). newrelic.webtransaction.name.remove_trailing_path Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false When enabled,this removes any content in the request URI after the script name. For example, this would remove the trailing /xyz/zy from /path/to/foo.php/xyz/zy. newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow sql traces. newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. Attribute settings This section lists the settings that affect attribute collection and reporting. newrelic.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the collection of attributes generated by the PHP agent or generated by the user through newrelic_add_custom_parameter(). This setting will take precedence over all other attribute configuration settings. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: True, except for browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Control which destinations receive attributes. These configuration settings will override the .include and .exclude settings. For more information on the destinations available, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.attributes.{include|exclude} Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) This is a family of configuration options that allow fine control over the destinations of attributes. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. Other .ini settings This section lists the remaining newrelic.ini settings. newrelic.enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: (none) Enable or disable the New Relic agent. By default the New Relic PHP agent is enabled for all directories. If you have multiple sites on your web server but only want the PHP agent to monitor specific ones: Make sure newrelic.enabled is set to true at the global (SYSTEM) level in your newrelic.ini file. Set newrelic.enabled to false for one or more specific sites on a per-directory basis (PERDIR). If you need to disable the agent globally, set the newrelic.enabled value to false in the newrelic.ini file. When the agent is globally disabled, it does not initialize completely. It assumes you are globally disabling it for a critical reason, and the agent will attempt to have as close to zero impact on PHP as possible. Important You cannot globally disable the agent and then selectively enable it on a per-directory basis by using .htaccess. newrelic.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/php_agent.log\" This identifies the file name for logging messages. This is useful for debugging any issues with the agent. Whatever you set this to, ensure that: The permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. The user that PHP runs as can write to the file. Usually this is the same user as the web server. newrelic.transaction_events.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report analytics event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. newrelic.error_collector.capture_events Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report error event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show Error analytics. newrelic.feature_flag Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This setting enables new and experimental features within the PHP agent. These flags are used to selectively enable features that are intended to be enabled by default in later versions of the PHP agent. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This enables auto-insertion of the JavaScript fragments for browser monitoring. When enabled will cause the agent to insert a header and a footer in HTML output that will generate metrics on page load timing for the end-user experience. For more information, see Page load timing in PHP. newrelic.guzzle.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables support for the Guzzle library when used with New Relic. PHP agent version 6.4 or higher: This setting is set to true by default. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: Introduced in PHP agent version 9.4 Enables the detection of frameworks and libraries when preloading is enabled. Preloading was introduced in PHP version 7.4. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection will only take effect when opcache.preload is set in the php.ini file.

      "body": "The daemon (newrelic-daemon) acts as a proxy between the PHP agent and the New Relic collector to reduce network traffic and to improve response time for instrumented applications. The daemon process starts when your system starts, and must be running for data to be sent to New Relic. Recommended configuration Beginning with version 3.0 of the PHP agent, the daemon can be automatically configured and started by the agent. Auto-configuration does not require the newrelic.cfg file. This is the recommended configuration. However, there are still some cases where manually starting the daemon is useful. For more information about the startup process, see New Relic daemon startup modes. Manual configuration A sample daemon configuration file was created during installation. To manually configure the daemon, copy and rename newrelic.cfg.template from /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg.template to /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg and edit the file. All settings are optional and most have default values. Important The agent will not automatically start the daemon if it finds a newrelic.cfg file in the /etc/newrelic/ directory. logfile Default: [none] Sets the name of the log file to use. Can be set on the command line by the daemon -l option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg Although the daemon itself provides no default name for the log file, the daemon startup scripts use the -l option to set the default location and name to /var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log. loglevel Default: info Sets the level of detail for messages sent to the log file. This field has the same possible values as the agent, which are, in increasing order of detail: error warning info debug If you are encountering problems with the daemon, set the log level debug for at least long enough to reproduce the problem. A debug log file is often necessary to debug issues with the proxy daemon. Can be set on the command line using the daemon --loglevel option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg ssl Default: yes This configuration setting is only available in PHP agent versions lower than 8.0. Versions 8.0 and higher will ignore this setting and always use HTTPS encryption to communicate with New Relic. When set to yes, the proxy will only use a secure connection to communicate with the collector. While the setting specifies SSL, the setting refers to HTTPS encryption to the latest industry standards. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to New Relic and the New Relic REST API. Can be enabled or disabled on the command line by the daemon --tls option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg ssl_ca_bundle Default: \"\" Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA bundle. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If ssl_ca_path is also set (see below), the certificates in this file will be searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when ssl is set to false. ssl_ca_path Default: \"\" Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA path. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If ssl_ca_bundle is also set (see above), it will be searched first followed by the certificates contained in ssl_ca_path. This setting has no effect when ssl is set to false. proxy Default: [none] Certain sites have very restrictive egress firewalls and require you to use a proxy in order to communicate with the outside world. If this applies to your site, you will need to set this value. The value is in the form scheme://user:password@hostname:port. The values scheme, user, password, and port may be omitted depending on your proxy configuration. For example, if you are using a HTTP proxy that does not require a user name and password, you could just use hostname:port. The port defaults to 1080 for most proxies. Can be set on the command line using the daemon --proxy option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg address (alias for port) Default: /tmp/.newrelic.sock Sets the socket endpoint the daemon will listen on. This endpoint allows agents to communicate with the daemon. This must be the same value as the agent's newrelic.daemon.address setting. This can be specified in these ways: Recommended. To use a specified file as a UNIX domain socket (UDS), provide an absolute path name as a string. To use a standard TCP port, specify a number in the range 1 to 65534. To use an abstract socket, use the value @newrelic-daemon (available for agent version 5.2.0.141 or higher). To enable connections from applications that are running on different hosts (helpful for container environments), set this value to host:port, where host denotes the host name or IP address of the local host, and port denotes a valid port number. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is available for PHP agent version 9.2.0.247 or higher. These options may also be set via the command line using the daemon --address option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg. pidfile Default: /tmp/newrelic.pid Sets the name of the file in which the daemon will record its process ID (pid). Although the daemon sets this to a default value of /tmp/newrelic.pid, the startup script almost always uses the --pidfile option to set it to /var/run/newrelic-daemon.pid. Can be set on the command line using the daemon --pidfile option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg auditlog Default: [none] This feature was introduced in version 3.4. When enabled, the agent will create an audit log, which contains all of the data sent from the daemon to New Relic. This data includes the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, un-encoded data for each request. This allows you to observe exactly what data is sent to New Relic in order to ensure no sensitive data is included. The file specified can not be the same file as the daemon log, as described above. This audit log can become very large very quickly, so New Relic recommends that you do not use it for extended periods of time. Can be set on the command line using the daemon --auditlog option.

Avoid creating lists of doc links in the For more help section, because it is harder for future writers to determine why they matter. Tip If you're linking to the product, see our style guide page on UI paths. Link text Follow these guidelines when writing text for hyperlinks: Labels: Make sure each link in the document has a unique, meaningful text label. Do not use the same text string to label different links. Location: Include a clear, concise text label to identify where the link goes. Give extra context if you're linking to an external site. Why are you sending someone there? Click here: Do not use \"click here\" or other meaningless link labels. \"Link test:\" Read just the links, without the surrounding text. Can each stand alone as a clear description of where the link goes if that is all the user looks at on the page? Avoid URL prefixes: If you're sending users to an address where you want to use the URL as the link text, drop the https: and www. prefixes from the link text. For example, [github.com](https://github.com) not [https://github.com/](https://github.com). Or [github.com/newrelic/docs-website](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/) not [https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/). Take the link test for these three examples. The last is the best for readers looking for information on configuring PHP, because the link clearly identifies it, without having to read anything else on the page. Quality \"Link test\" example Bad To learn more about renaming your PHP app, click here. Okay To learn more about renaming your PHP app, see New Relic's config docs. Good To learn more about renaming your PHP app, use the PHP agent (newrelic.ini) settings. Support links Never include a hyperlink to the Support email address. This prevents spam and ensures customers use the ticket submission form to create tickets so they receive the correct support priority. If you need to tell customers to contact support, use this instead: Get support at [support.newrelic.com](support.newrelic.com). Copy Docs site (\"internal\") links When creating links to other documents on the Docs site, include only the path from /docs forward. Do not include https://docs.newrelic.com, or the site will treat it as an external link. Here is an example: [/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-newrelic-ini-settings](PHP agent (newrelic.ini) settings Copy Anchor links If your link includes an anchor (for example, #inivar-scope), use the complete, current doc path it uses. Some browsers do not retain anchors with redirects. When creating or editing an HTML id for an anchor link, follow these guidelines: Only use lower case when creating new IDs. Use hyphens - to separate words. Don't use _ underscores. When reorganizing a doc, try to preserve incoming anchor links where possible. Be mindful that when you delete a level two heading ##, it will break any links to that heading. Avoid changing an existing anchor ID, because we may be monitoring traffic to it from our internal New Relic account. External links When creating links to websites outside the docs.newrelic.com subdomain (including newrelic.com, one.newrelic.com, discuss.newrelic.com), the Docs site automatically includes code that opens the link in a new tab. In addition to the link text guidelines in this doc, here are some other things to keep in mind when linking to external sites: Think about the best way to future-proof your links. If possible, point to a top-level domain, but not if it reduces the usefulness of the link. How stable is the content you're linking to? Is the URL likely to change? Make sure your link is as useful as possible. What value are you trying to add to the document? Can that information be shared in another way? Help the reader understand why you're linking to this external source. Is it a useful reference, such as a list of time zones? Is it a way to save someone time, such as linking directly to a hard-to-find file? Make sure that your link is generally accessible. Are you linking to an external site that requires authentication, such as a private GitHub repo? Linking to an arbitrary (non-heading, non-collapser-entry) section in a doc H2 and H3 headings and collapsers have their own built-in IDs that you can link to. But sometimes you may want to link to a paragraph or to a table entry. In general, avoid this, and instead, link to headings and collapsers. Occasionally it's useful to link to a specific entry in a table, or a very important paragraph in a conceptual explanation. To do that, place a <span> tag around some text, using this format: <span id=\"name\">your text</span> Copy And then link to it using the standard anchor link format.",

      "body": "New Relic for PHP gives you several ways to change the application name that is reported to, and displayed in, New Relic. This document gives you an overview of those naming options. For a general overview of APM app naming (not PHP-specific), see Name your application. Set or change app name New Relic differentiates applications by their name. When you change the name an application reports as, New Relic creates a new application entity and breaks data continuity between the new and old entity. To change an application's name without breaking data continuity, use the UI alias-change option. Here are the ways to change your PHP application's name in New Relic: Configure newrelic.ini file using newrelic.appname: The recommended and most commonly used option. Set per-directory INI settings: Useful for when you have one web server serving multiple applications and want to have different settings or names for them. (Procedures for Apache, PHP-FPM, and NGINX in PHP-FPM are documented.) Change alias via UI: This changes only the alias in the UI, not the underlying app name being reported. (This option does not break data continuity in APM.) Change via API: An option if you have access to modify your application code, are okay with instrumenting it directly, and find the trace continuity implications of this call acceptable. Use multiple app names Important The ability to set multiple app names is only available in PHP agent versions 2.4 or higher. You can use multiple app names to aggregate data from several applications under the same name in APM (sometimes referred to as \"rolling up\" your data). For more about how multiple app names work, see Use multiple app names. For PHP, you can set up to three application names. The primary application name is first, and the second and third names are used for the more general data aggregation categories. PHP config file example Here is an example of setting multiple names in the newrelic.ini file: newrelic.appname=\"Virtual Host 1;Virtual Hosts in Some Region;All Virtual Hosts\" Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Whenever possible, include hyperlinks where relevant within the text itself. Avoid creating lists of doc links in the For more help section, because it is harder for future writers to determine why they matter. Tip If you're linking to the product, see our style guide page on UI paths. Link text Follow these guidelines when writing text for hyperlinks: Labels: Make sure each link in the document has a unique, meaningful text label. Do not use the same text string to label different links. Location: Include a clear, concise text label to identify where the link goes. Give extra context if you're linking to an external site. Why are you sending someone there? Click here: Do not use \"click here\" or other meaningless link labels. \"Link test:\" Read just the links, without the surrounding text. Can each stand alone as a clear description of where the link goes if that is all the user looks at on the page? Avoid URL prefixes: If you're sending users to an address where you want to use the URL as the link text, drop the https: and www. prefixes from the link text. For example, [github.com](https://github.com) not [https://github.com/](https://github.com). Or [github.com/newrelic/docs-website](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/) not [https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/). Take the link test for these three examples. The last is the best for readers looking for information on configuring PHP, because the link clearly identifies it, without having to read anything else on the page. Quality \"Link test\" example Bad To learn more about renaming your PHP app, click here. Okay To learn more about renaming your PHP app, see New Relic's config docs. Good To learn more about renaming your PHP app, use the PHP agent (newrelic.ini) settings. Support links Never include a hyperlink to the Support email address. This prevents spam and ensures customers use the ticket submission form to create tickets so they receive the correct support priority. If you need to tell customers to contact support, use this instead: Get support at [support.newrelic.com](support.newrelic.com). Copy Docs site (\"internal\") links When creating links to other documents on the Docs site, include only the path from /docs forward. Do not include https://docs.newrelic.com, or the site will treat it as an external link. Here is an example: [/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-newrelic-ini-settings](PHP agent (newrelic.ini) settings Copy Anchor links If your link includes an anchor (for example, #inivar-scope), use the complete, current doc path it uses. Some browsers do not retain anchors with redirects. When creating or editing an HTML id for an anchor link, follow these guidelines: Only use lower case when creating new IDs. Use hyphens - to separate words. Don't use _ underscores. When reorganizing a doc, try to preserve incoming anchor links where possible. Be mindful that when you delete a level two heading ##, it will break any links to that heading. Avoid changing an existing anchor ID, because we may be monitoring traffic to it from our internal New Relic account. External links When creating links to websites outside the docs.newrelic.com subdomain (including newrelic.com, one.newrelic.com, discuss.newrelic.com), the Docs site automatically includes code that opens the link in a new tab. In addition to the link text guidelines in this doc, here are some other things to keep in mind when linking to external sites: Think about the best way to future-proof your links. If possible, point to a top-level domain, but not if it reduces the usefulness of the link. How stable is the content you're linking to? Is the URL likely to change? Make sure your link is as useful as possible. What value are you trying to add to the document? Can that information be shared in another way? Help the reader understand why you're linking to this external source. Is it a useful reference, such as a list of time zones? Is it a way to save someone time, such as linking directly to a hard-to-find file? Make sure that your link is generally accessible. Are you linking to an external site that requires authentication, such as a private GitHub repo? Linking to an arbitrary (non-heading, non-collapser-entry) section in a doc H2 and H3 headings and collapsers have their own built-in IDs that you can link to. But sometimes you may want to link to a paragraph or to a table entry. In general, avoid this, and instead, link to headings and collapsers. Occasionally it's useful to link to a specific entry in a table, or a very important paragraph in a conceptual explanation. To do that, place a <span> tag around some text, using this format: <span id=\"name\">your text</span> Copy And then link to it using the standard anchor link format.",

      "body": "Our PHP agent has a number of settings to fine-tune the types and amounts of data reported. For most users, the default values produce the best possible mix of overhead and utility. However, you can change the settings for your specific needs. Important Always restart your web server after changing INI settings. Otherwise, they may not take effect immediately. Configuration order of precedence Here is a simple illustration of the order of precedence that the PHP agent follows for configuration. Server-side configuration is not applicable. The only values you can change in the UI for apps using the PHP agent are the app's alias and its Apdex-T value. With New Relic's PHP agent, API settings override per-directory configuration settings. Per-directory settings override the php.ini file settings. Server-side configuration is not applicable. Configuration file variables During installation, the newrelic-install script provides information about the configuration files it created or a list of files you need to edit. By default it will attempt to create a configuration file named newrelic.ini. In some cases, you may be instructed to add configuration options to your php.ini file. Only do this if necessary. Exactly which file you need to edit depends on how your particular version (or versions) of PHP were configured. The two most common configurations are: Use a single newrelic.ini file. This is usually the default if you have installed or compiled PHP yourself with no special options. Scan a given directory for all .ini files. If you are unsure which file to edit: From the command line, review the output of php -i. In a browser, review the output of a page containing the script: <?php phpinfo(); ?> Copy If the newrelic.ini file appears, use it. Variable scope Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined scope. The scope controls where the setting can be established or modified. The two scopes supported for New Relic settings are: SYSTEM: Values set globally in the global newrelic.ini file. PERDIR: Values set on a per-directory basis. Each can also be set at a more general level. Valid locations for each are: Can be set for: SYSTEM PERDIR Set in the global newrelic.ini file. Set on a per-directory basis. Important You cannot use ini_set() for New Relic settings. Variable type Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined type. The type specifies the syntax for the value you use. Variable type Formatting and contents String String values can contain any alphanumeric character and punctuation. The value is delimited by quotes. Boolean A logical true or false setting. Valid values are: For true or enabled: on, true, the number 1. For false or disabled: off, false, the number 0. Number Numeric values can only contain digits, plus a period to indicate floats. Unless otherwise stated, all numbers are integers, not floats. Duration A string value delimited by quotes that represent a time duration. Use character flags to delimit time components. If there are no flags, the time is in milliseconds. w\\ = weeks d\\ = days h\\ = hours m\\ = minutes s\\ = seconds ms\\ = milliseconds us\\ = microseconds Example durations: \"1w3d23h10m\"\\ = 1 week, 3 days, 23 hours, and 10 minutes \"5h30m\"\\ = 5 hours and 30 minutes \"500\"\\ = 500 milliseconds General configuration settings These settings are available in the newrelic.ini file. newrelic.appname (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"PHP Application\" This config option sets the application name that data is reported under in APM. We highly recommends that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in New Relic, so set this carefully. For all application-naming options, including per-directory settings, see Name your PHP application. The setting's value is a semicolon-separated list of up to three application names. The first name in the list is the primary application name. It must be unique for each account. The application name is used as a key into a cache. When using multiple names for an app, New Relic only uses the first name for caching. Therefore, each application name can only appear as the first element once. Caching example If you set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App2\" and later in the code set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App3\", the second one will appear not to work. It will report to App1 and App2 because of the caching. If you need overlapping application names, set the common application name in the second or third positions. For example: newrelic.appname=\"App2;App1\" and newrelic.appname=\"App3;App1\". This is useful, for example, when you want to track a superset of applications. newrelic.capture_params Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. To set this value programmatically, use the newrelic_capture_params() API function. If you pass sensitive information directly in the URL, keep this disabled. If set to true, this will enable the recording of parameters passed to a PHP script via the URL (everything after the ? in the URL) in transaction traces. These will appear under the Parameters dropdown when displaying transaction traces. newrelic.framework Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: (auto-detected) The New Relic PHP agent automatically detects the frameworks it supports, but problems may arise if you are using experimental new versions or if you have customized the framework. This setting disables automatic framework detection, instead telling the agent to attempt to name transactions according to the specified framework. Specifying \"no_framework\" will disable framework-related transaction naming entirely. Use any of the following values, as appropriate: \"cakephp\" \"codeigniter\" \"drupal\" (for Drupal 6 and 7) \"drupal8\" \"joomla\" \"kohana\" \"laravel\" \"magento\" \"magento2\" \"mediawiki\" \"silex\" \"symfony1\" \"symfony2\" (for Symfony 2 and 3) \"symfony4\" \"wordpress\" \"yii\" \"zend\" \"zend2\" (for Zend Framework 2 and 3) \"no_framework\" (to force no framework even if one was detected) If the framework auto-detection fails, this command will also fail. newrelic.ignored_params Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. Use the newrelic.ignored_params setting to specify a comma-separated list of parameter names to be excluded from the list of parameters sent to the New Relic servers. Enclose the string values with quote marks. If you enable parameter capturing with newrelic.capture_params, there may be parameters with sensitive user data you do not want to be captured by New Relic or visible in transaction traces. Use this to block the recording of this data. newrelic.license (REQUIRED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Notes: Introduced in agent version 3.0. Sets the New Relic license key to use. In a multi-tenant system this can be set on a per-directory basis. Tip When you upgrade from an old agent version to 3.0 or higher, the license will be removed from your daemon configuration file (with a comment explaining why) and stored in the file /etc/newrelic/upgrade_please.key. Copy the license out of that file and set it in your newrelic.ini file. Delete the upgrade_please.key file. newrelic.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the level of detail of messages sent to the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, include: error warning info verbose debug verbosedebug When reporting any agent issues to New Relic technical support, verbosedebug is the most useful setting. However, this can generate a lot of information very quickly, so avoid keeping the agent at verbosedebug level for longer than it takes to reproduce the problem you are experiencing. When reporting any agent issues to New Relic Technical Support, you may be asked to set this to a custom level, enabling debugging only for certain subsystems. Custom levels are beyond the scope of this document. newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 1 Notes: This used to be newrelic.transaction_tracer.top100. Sets the level of detail in a transaction trace: When set to 1, all server calls are traced. When set to 0, traces only include internally instrumented calls by New Relic and those defined by the user using newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom. The default level of 1 does have a performance impact. If you need to improve performance, try setting the detail level to 0. When not tracing all server calls, blocks of time in transaction traces will be labeled as uninstrumented time, and only certain functions (defined internally by the agent) are instrumented. Even when reporting all calls, there may be uninstrumented time in the traces. newrelic.high_security Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables high security for all applications. When high security is set to true, the following behaviors take effect: Data will not be sent to New Relic unless the newrelic-daemon is using a secure connection (HTTPS). If the PHP process spawns a newrelic-daemon, it will be configured to use HTTPS regardless of the value of newrelic.daemon.ssl. Raw query strings will never be gathered, regardless of the value of newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql. Request attributes will never be captured, regardless of the newrelic.attributes configuration settings. The newrelic_add_custom_parameter and newrelic_set_user_attributes API function will have no effect, and they will return false. The newrelic_record_custom_event API function will not submit any events to New Relic. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Caution If you change the newrelic.high_security setting, you must also change the security setting in the APM user interface. If the two settings do not match, then no data will be collected. For more information, see High security. newrelic.labels Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Adds tags. Example tags \"Server:One;Data Center:Primary\" Copy newrelic.process_host.display_name Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. Daemon .ini settings The values of these settings control the daemon startup. When the agent detects that the daemon needs to be started, it will convert these options into the appropriate command line options for the daemon. All of these settings mirror the settings in the newrelic.cfg file. They are repeated here to keep all of the .ini settings in one place. Each setting in newrelic.cfg has its counterpart here, with newrelic.daemon. as the prefix. For example, the ssl setting in newrelic.cfg is newrelic.daemon.ssl in an .ini file. Important If the file /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent ignores these settings, and the agent will not start the daemon automatically. For more information about ways to start the daemon and when to use an external configuration file, see PHP daemon startup modes. newrelic.daemon.app_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"5m\" or \"1h20m\" Default: \"10m\" Sets the elapsed time after which an application will be considered inactive. Inactive applications do not count against the maximum limit of 250 applications. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". A value of 0 will be interpreted as \"no timeout.\" This will result in new applications always counting towards the 250 application limit, as well as the daemon being unable to release a small amount of memory per application back to the operating system. Recommendation: Do not use this value unless New Relic Support requests it. Instead, for occasional background transactions, use a value of twice the interval. For example, for an hourly background job, set the timeout to 2 hours. newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon connecting an application. A value of 0 causes the agent to only make one attempt at connecting to the daemon. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". With this timeout set, the agent will not immediately drop a transaction when the daemon hasn't connected to the backend yet, but rather grant the daemon time to establish the connection. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 15s. Only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of connection problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. newrelic.daemon.auditlog Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" The setting specifies the name of an audit log, which will contain all of the data sent from the daemon to the New Relic servers, including the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, unencoded data for each request. This file cannot be the same file as the daemon log. Important This audit log can become very large, very quickly. Avoid using the newrelic.daemon.auditlog setting for extended periods of time. Its primary purpose is to allow system administrators to perform security reviews and to observe exactly what data transmits. newrelic.daemon.collector_host Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"collector.newrelic.com\" Sets the name and optional port of the collector host which the daemon will contact to verify your license key and send agent data. This is either just the name of the host or the name and port number in the form \"hostname:port\". Specifying a port number of 0 will use the default port, which is 80. Caution Do not change this value without guidance from New Relic Support. newrelic.daemon.dont_launch Scope: SYSTEM Type: Number Default: 0 If you prefer to have the daemon launched externally before the agent starts up, this value determines when the agent is allowed to start the daemon: 0: No restrictions are placed on daemon startup and the agent can start the daemon any time. 1: Non-command line (such as Apache or php-fpm) agents can start the daemon. 2: Only command line agents can start the daemon. 3: The agent will never start the daemon. Use this setting if you are configuring the daemon via newrelic.cfg and starting it outside of the agent. Important If /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent assumes the daemon is meant to be started by its startup script, not via the agent. This setting has no meaning to and does not appear in newrelic.cfg. newrelic.daemon.location Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/usr/bin/newrelic-daemon\" Sets the name of the daemon executable to launch. This variable identifies the full path to the daemon executable file. If the New Relic system was installed using the standard packages, the default location will be correct. If you have installed to a custom location using the tar distribution (and do not have permission to write to /usr/bin), then the daemon may reside at another location. This setting does not appear in the newrelic.cfg file as it is only relevant to PHP. Important On OpenSolaris, /usr is frequently a read-only file system. The default daemon location for OpenSolaris is /opt/newrelic/bin/newrelic-daemon. newrelic.daemon.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log\" Sets the name of the log file to record daemon specific log messages. This file must be writable by the daemon. The most common case is that the Apache user will end up starting the daemon when Apache itself starts up, thus you should ensure that the file is writable by whichever user runs the Apache process. Caution If the daemon log file is not writable, the daemon will not start automatically, which will prevent data from reporting. You can use write permissions to this file as a means of restricting who can start the daemon. newrelic.daemon.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the detail level for messages recorded to New Relic's daemon log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: error warning info debug The more verbose settings can generate a lot of information very quickly. When necessary, set debug for short periods of time to identify problems. newrelic.daemon.pidfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: (depends on OS) Sets the name of the file in which the daemon will record its process ID (pid). This file is used by the daemon startup and shutdown script to determine whether or not the daemon is already running. newrelic.daemon.address (alias for newrelic.daemon.port) Scope: SYSTEM Type: String or Number Default: \"@newrelic\" on Linux, \"/tmp/.newrelic.sock\" otherwise Tip From v9.2.0.247, the PHP agent supports a new setting, newrelic.daemon.address,which serves as an alias to newrelic.daemon.port. You can use either to specify the location of the New Relic PHP daemon. If both values are set, newrelic.daemon.address takes precedence. Sets the socket endpoint for agent to daemon communications. This can be specified in four ways. To use a specified file as a UNIX domain socket (UDS), provide an absolute path name as a string. This is the default on non-Linux systems. To use a standard TCP port, specify a number in the range 1 to 65534. To use an abstract socket, use the value @newrelic-daemon (available for agent version 5.2.0.141 or higher). This is the default on Linux systems. To connect to a daemon that is running on a different host (helpful for container environments), set this value to host:port, where host denotes either a host name or an IP, and port denotes a valid port number. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is available for agent version 9.2.0.247 or higher. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon (this only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts). If you use port numbers, Unix systems require that ports in the range 1 to 1023 require the daemon be run as the super-user. In case the daemon uses a non-standard port, this variable also sets the port number the agent will use for communicating with the daemon. Important If you're using the newrelic.cfg startup mechanism for the daemon, this setting and the address setting in that file must match. newrelic.daemon.proxy Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the host and user credentials to use as an egress proxy. This is only used if your site requires a proxy in order to access the New Relic data collection servers. It can take any of the following forms, depending on the proxy setup: hostname hostname:port user@hostname user@hostname:port user:password@hostname user:password@hostname:port proxytype://user:password@hostname:port A proxy type of HTTP is assumed unless another proxytype is specified. In that case, proxytype can be one of http, socks4, socks4a, or socks5. newrelic.daemon.ssl Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true This setting is ignored on PHP agent versions 8.0 and higher, and HTTPS will always be used to communicate with New Relic. On versions of the PHP agent versions lower than 8.0, controls whether or not communication with New Relic collectors should use a secure HTTP connection. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA bundle. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path is also set, the certificates in this file will be searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA path. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle is also set, it will be searched first followed by the certificates contained in newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.start_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon to start after a daemon launch was triggered. A value of 0 causes the agent to not wait. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\" and \"h\". The specified timeout value will be passed to the daemon via the --wait-for-port flag. This causes daemon startup to block until a socket is acquired or until the timeout is elapsed. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 2s to 5s. It is recommended to only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of daemon start problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. Transaction tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Set this to a comma-separated list of user defined functions or methods to instrument: \"myfunction,myclass::method,otherfunction\" Copy Internal PHP functions cannot have custom tracing. You can add to the list of custom functions with each PERDIR file, but you cannot remove a function or method that has already been added. If you want to programmatically add functions or methods to be instrumented, use the newrelic_add_custom_tracer() API function call. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables the transaction tracer. The tracer creates a detailed transaction trace for transactions that take more time than the threshold, as set by the newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold value. Only one transaction trace per application per harvest cycle is stored and it is always the slowest transaction during that cycle. Transaction traces are useful for diagnosing why a particular transaction was slow. Unless memory and performance are critical, they should almost never be disabled. Enabling this does have a very slight performance impact and does use more memory. For more information, see newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables requesting explain plans from MySQLi and PDO MySQL libraries for slow query calls. Explain plans will only be available when newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql is set to true and newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is not set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" Sets the threshold beyond which queries are considered \"slow\" and thus candidates for the Slow Queries page. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.internal_functions_enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables or disables support for tracing internal functions (that is, functions written in C and provided either via the PHP standard library or PECL extensions). When enabled, internal functions appear in transaction traces like functions written in PHP. Enabling this option may result in transactions being slower, especially when collecting many traces from PHP 5.x. Enabling this option is only recommended when specifically debugging performance issues where an internal function is suspected to be slow. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"obfuscated\" Sets how queries are recorded (if at all). When recording transaction traces internally, the full query for slow query calls is recorded. Sending this query to New Relic can have serious security implications, so by default, all database statements are obfuscated before being sent to New Relic. The obfuscation is not reversible, as it replaces strings and numbers in any query with question marks. The only things that survive intact are field names, not any of their values. If you are testing with data that is not sensitive and you need to see the raw queries in transaction traces, set this to \"raw\". If you do not want queries recorded at all, set this to \"off\". Important Always set this back to \"obfuscated\" or \"off\" in any production environment. newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable the Slow Queries feature. When enabled, it will: Record the top 10 slowest database queries per application per minute. Create a stack trace leading up to the query. If this variable is set to false or SQL recording is disabled, the New Relic agent does not gather any slow query data. newrelic.transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" This sets the threshold above which the agent will record the full PHP stack for transaction traces for which queries are being recorded. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" Stack traces can consume memory, so be careful of setting this value too low. This variable has no meaning if newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"apdex_f\" Use this variable to set the threshold beyond which transactions are eligible for being traced. Available values include: Use \"apdex_f\" to set the threshold to 4 times the application's apdex_t value. For more information, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. Use any other duration string to set a specific time threshold. Specify the duration as an absolute value and the unit of measurement. If none is specified, the unit defaults to millisecond. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.gather_input_queries Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable gathering of DQL input queries with Slow Queries and Transaction Traces. When enabled, these will appear along with slow queries and transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 0 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for web transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP web processes; it will not effect PHP CLI processes. To set a limit for CLI processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 100000 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for CLI transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP CLI processes; it will not effect PHP web processes. To set a limit for web processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web. Other tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control various tracer features. newrelic.cross_application_tracer.enabled Important A distributed tracing feature is available. Distributed tracing improves on cross application tracing and is recommended for monitoring activity in complex distributed systems. Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the cross application tracer. The cross application tracer inserts HTTP headers into outbound requests and the response in order to link together web transaction metrics and transaction traces between applications. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the PHP agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross-application tracing. Before enabling, read the transition guide to understand effects on New Relic features. Enable or disable distributed tracing. When the agent's transaction tracer and distributed tracing features are enabled, the agent will insert headers into outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic distributed tracing header that is attached to outbound requests, and to instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are attached to outbound requests. The New Relic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that do not support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over New Relic headers for distributed tracing. newrelic.span_events_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Span event reporting requires distributed tracing to be enabled. This option enables/disables the reporting of span events. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: \"\" Configures the Trace Observer used for Infinite Tracing. If empty, Infinite Tracing support will be disabled. This requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer Default: 443 Configures the TCP/IP port used to communicate with the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. This setting is ignored if newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host is empty. This setting will not usually need to be changed. newrelic.infinite_tracing.span_events.queue_size Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer (1000 or higher) Default: 100000 Sets the number of span events that can be queued for transmission to the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. The agent internally manages span events for Infinite Tracing in span batches. Those span batches can hold a maximum of 1000 spans. Therefore, the span events queue size cannot be lower than 1000, as otherwise not even a single span batch can be queued. If a queue size lower than 1000 is specified, the minimum size of 1000 is used. newrelic.error_collector.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the error collector. When enabled, the agent collects and reports PHP errors to the New Relic UI. The agent records only the single most severe error for each transaction, and up to 20 errors per harvest cycle. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. newrelic.error_collector.record_database_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When enabled, the agent collects errors returned by MySQL functions as if they were PHP errors. newrelic.error_collector.prioritize_api_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to assign the highest priority to errors identified through the newrelic_notice_error() API function. newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) A comma separated list of fully-qualified exception class names that the agent should ignore. When an unhandled exception occurs, the agent will perform the equivalent of $exception instanceof Class for each of the classes listed. If any of those checks returns true, the agent will not record an exception. Depending on the supported PHP release, these values are equivalent to disabling exception reporting: Supported PHP 5 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Exceptions Supported PHP 7 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Throwable newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer or a bitwise expression of PHP-defined error constants Default: 0 Sets the error levels for the PHP agent to ignore. The value for this setting uses similar syntax to PHP's error_reporting option. For example, to configure the PHP agent to ignore E_WARNING and E_ERROR level errors, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_WARNING | E_ERROR or newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = 3 To configure the PHP agent to ignore everything but E_WARNING, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_ALL & ~E_WARNING newrelic.framework.drupal.modules Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: In agents prior to version 3.0 the default for this value was false. Setting this option implied newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail = 1. To enable Drupal module tracking, set this to true. This option has the same performance impact as newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. It will enable the recording of Drupal module functions and call counts, and they will display under the Modules tab, much like web transactions. newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true To enable WordPress hook tracking, set this to true. It will enable the recording of WordPress hooks, plugins, and themes, and they will display under the WordPress tab in the New Relic UI. newrelic.webtransaction.name.files Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" This is the same as newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions, except it uses file names to name the web transaction. The file names can be standard POSIX regular expression to be used with PCRE; for example, \"controllers/actions/.*\". newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Unless the New Relic agent detects a specific framework, such as Drupal or Wordpress, web transactions are named after the initial PHP file; for example, article.php. When the initial file is a dispatcher, this naming scheme produces less than useful data. Use this variable to specify a list of functions that are the \"actions\" generated by the dispatcher. The name of the web transaction will be the first action function executed. Example dispatch function naming If index.php dispatches to functions named: login, logout, admin, show, and edit You would set this value to \"login,logout,admin,show,edit\". The web transactions will be named login, logout, etc. instead of /index.php (the initial file name). newrelic.webtransaction.name.remove_trailing_path Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false When enabled,this removes any content in the request URI after the script name. For example, this would remove the trailing /xyz/zy from /path/to/foo.php/xyz/zy. newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow sql traces. newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. Attribute settings This section lists the settings that affect attribute collection and reporting. newrelic.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the collection of attributes generated by the PHP agent or generated by the user through newrelic_add_custom_parameter(). This setting will take precedence over all other attribute configuration settings. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: True, except for browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Control which destinations receive attributes. These configuration settings will override the .include and .exclude settings. For more information on the destinations available, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.attributes.{include|exclude} Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) This is a family of configuration options that allow fine control over the destinations of attributes. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. Other .ini settings This section lists the remaining newrelic.ini settings. newrelic.enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: (none) Enable or disable the New Relic agent. By default the New Relic PHP agent is enabled for all directories. If you have multiple sites on your web server but only want the PHP agent to monitor specific ones: Make sure newrelic.enabled is set to true at the global (SYSTEM) level in your newrelic.ini file. Set newrelic.enabled to false for one or more specific sites on a per-directory basis (PERDIR). If you need to disable the agent globally, set the newrelic.enabled value to false in the newrelic.ini file. When the agent is globally disabled, it does not initialize completely. It assumes you are globally disabling it for a critical reason, and the agent will attempt to have as close to zero impact on PHP as possible. Important You cannot globally disable the agent and then selectively enable it on a per-directory basis by using .htaccess. newrelic.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/php_agent.log\" This identifies the file name for logging messages. This is useful for debugging any issues with the agent. Whatever you set this to, ensure that: The permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. The user that PHP runs as can write to the file. Usually this is the same user as the web server. newrelic.transaction_events.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report analytics event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. newrelic.error_collector.capture_events Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report error event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show Error analytics. newrelic.feature_flag Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This setting enables new and experimental features within the PHP agent. These flags are used to selectively enable features that are intended to be enabled by default in later versions of the PHP agent. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This enables auto-insertion of the JavaScript fragments for browser monitoring. When enabled will cause the agent to insert a header and a footer in HTML output that will generate metrics on page load timing for the end-user experience. For more information, see Page load timing in PHP. newrelic.guzzle.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables support for the Guzzle library when used with New Relic. PHP agent version 6.4 or higher: This setting is set to true by default. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: Introduced in PHP agent version 9.4 Enables the detection of frameworks and libraries when preloading is enabled. Preloading was introduced in PHP version 7.4. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection will only take effect when opcache.preload is set in the php.ini file.

      "body": "The daemon (newrelic-daemon) acts as a proxy between the PHP agent and the New Relic collector to reduce network traffic and to improve response time for instrumented applications. The daemon process starts when your system starts, and must be running for data to be sent to New Relic. Recommended configuration Beginning with version 3.0 of the PHP agent, the daemon can be automatically configured and started by the agent. Auto-configuration does not require the newrelic.cfg file. This is the recommended configuration. However, there are still some cases where manually starting the daemon is useful. For more information about the startup process, see New Relic daemon startup modes. Manual configuration A sample daemon configuration file was created during installation. To manually configure the daemon, copy and rename newrelic.cfg.template from /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg.template to /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg and edit the file. All settings are optional and most have default values. Important The agent will not automatically start the daemon if it finds a newrelic.cfg file in the /etc/newrelic/ directory. logfile Default: [none] Sets the name of the log file to use. Can be set on the command line by the daemon -l option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg Although the daemon itself provides no default name for the log file, the daemon startup scripts use the -l option to set the default location and name to /var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log. loglevel Default: info Sets the level of detail for messages sent to the log file. This field has the same possible values as the agent, which are, in increasing order of detail: error warning info debug If you are encountering problems with the daemon, set the log level debug for at least long enough to reproduce the problem. A debug log file is often necessary to debug issues with the proxy daemon. Can be set on the command line using the daemon --loglevel option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg ssl Default: yes This configuration setting is only available in PHP agent versions lower than 8.0. Versions 8.0 and higher will ignore this setting and always use HTTPS encryption to communicate with New Relic. When set to yes, the proxy will only use a secure connection to communicate with the collector. While the setting specifies SSL, the setting refers to HTTPS encryption to the latest industry standards. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to New Relic and the New Relic REST API. Can be enabled or disabled on the command line by the daemon --tls option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg ssl_ca_bundle Default: \"\" Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA bundle. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If ssl_ca_path is also set (see below), the certificates in this file will be searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when ssl is set to false. ssl_ca_path Default: \"\" Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA path. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If ssl_ca_bundle is also set (see above), it will be searched first followed by the certificates contained in ssl_ca_path. This setting has no effect when ssl is set to false. proxy Default: [none] Certain sites have very restrictive egress firewalls and require you to use a proxy in order to communicate with the outside world. If this applies to your site, you will need to set this value. The value is in the form scheme://user:password@hostname:port. The values scheme, user, password, and port may be omitted depending on your proxy configuration. For example, if you are using a HTTP proxy that does not require a user name and password, you could just use hostname:port. The port defaults to 1080 for most proxies. Can be set on the command line using the daemon --proxy option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg address (alias for port) Default: /tmp/.newrelic.sock Sets the socket endpoint the daemon will listen on. This endpoint allows agents to communicate with the daemon. This must be the same value as the agent's newrelic.daemon.address setting. This can be specified in these ways: Recommended. To use a specified file as a UNIX domain socket (UDS), provide an absolute path name as a string. To use a standard TCP port, specify a number in the range 1 to 65534. To use an abstract socket, use the value @newrelic-daemon (available for agent version 5.2.0.141 or higher). To enable connections from applications that are running on different hosts (helpful for container environments), set this value to host:port, where host denotes the host name or IP address of the local host, and port denotes a valid port number. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is available for PHP agent version 9.2.0.247 or higher. These options may also be set via the command line using the daemon --address option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg. pidfile Default: /tmp/newrelic.pid Sets the name of the file in which the daemon will record its process ID (pid). Although the daemon sets this to a default value of /tmp/newrelic.pid, the startup script almost always uses the --pidfile option to set it to /var/run/newrelic-daemon.pid. Can be set on the command line using the daemon --pidfile option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg auditlog Default: [none] This feature was introduced in version 3.4. When enabled, the agent will create an audit log, which contains all of the data sent from the daemon to New Relic. This data includes the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, un-encoded data for each request. This allows you to observe exactly what data is sent to New Relic in order to ensure no sensitive data is included. The file specified can not be the same file as the daemon log, as described above. This audit log can become very large very quickly, so New Relic recommends that you do not use it for extended periods of time. Can be set on the command line using the daemon --auditlog option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Avoid creating lists of doc links in the For more help section, because it is harder for future writers to determine why they matter. Tip If you're linking to the product, see our style guide page on UI paths. Link text Follow these guidelines when writing text for hyperlinks: Labels: Make sure each link in the document has a unique, meaningful text label. Do not use the same text string to label different links. Location: Include a clear, concise text label to identify where the link goes. Give extra context if you're linking to an external site. Why are you sending someone there? Click here: Do not use \"click here\" or other meaningless link labels. \"Link test:\" Read just the links, without the surrounding text. Can each stand alone as a clear description of where the link goes if that is all the user looks at on the page? Avoid URL prefixes: If you're sending users to an address where you want to use the URL as the link text, drop the https: and www. prefixes from the link text. For example, [github.com](https://github.com) not [https://github.com/](https://github.com). Or [github.com/newrelic/docs-website](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/) not [https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/). Take the link test for these three examples. The last is the best for readers looking for information on configuring PHP, because the link clearly identifies it, without having to read anything else on the page. Quality \"Link test\" example Bad To learn more about renaming your PHP app, click here. Okay To learn more about renaming your PHP app, see New Relic's config docs. Good To learn more about renaming your PHP app, use the PHP agent (newrelic.ini) settings. Support links Never include a hyperlink to the Support email address. This prevents spam and ensures customers use the ticket submission form to create tickets so they receive the correct support priority. If you need to tell customers to contact support, use this instead: Get support at [support.newrelic.com](support.newrelic.com). Copy Docs site (\"internal\") links When creating links to other documents on the Docs site, include only the path from /docs forward. Do not include https://docs.newrelic.com, or the site will treat it as an external link. Here is an example: [/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-newrelic-ini-settings](PHP agent (newrelic.ini) settings Copy Anchor links If your link includes an anchor (for example, #inivar-scope), use the complete, current doc path it uses. Some browsers do not retain anchors with redirects. When creating or editing an HTML id for an anchor link, follow these guidelines: Only use lower case when creating new IDs. Use hyphens - to separate words. Don't use _ underscores. When reorganizing a doc, try to preserve incoming anchor links where possible. Be mindful that when you delete a level two heading ##, it will break any links to that heading. Avoid changing an existing anchor ID, because we may be monitoring traffic to it from our internal New Relic account. External links When creating links to websites outside the docs.newrelic.com subdomain (including newrelic.com, one.newrelic.com, discuss.newrelic.com), the Docs site automatically includes code that opens the link in a new tab. In addition to the link text guidelines in this doc, here are some other things to keep in mind when linking to external sites: Think about the best way to future-proof your links. If possible, point to a top-level domain, but not if it reduces the usefulness of the link. How stable is the content you're linking to? Is the URL likely to change? Make sure your link is as useful as possible. What value are you trying to add to the document? Can that information be shared in another way? Help the reader understand why you're linking to this external source. Is it a useful reference, such as a list of time zones? Is it a way to save someone time, such as linking directly to a hard-to-find file? Make sure that your link is generally accessible. Are you linking to an external site that requires authentication, such as a private GitHub repo? Linking to an arbitrary (non-heading, non-collapser-entry) section in a doc H2 and H3 headings and collapsers have their own built-in IDs that you can link to. But sometimes you may want to link to a paragraph or to a table entry. In general, avoid this, and instead, link to headings and collapsers. Occasionally it's useful to link to a specific entry in a table, or a very important paragraph in a conceptual explanation. To do that, place a <span> tag around some text, using this format: <span id=\"name\">your text</span> Copy And then link to it using the standard anchor link format.",

      "body": "Our PHP agent has a number of settings to fine-tune the types and amounts of data reported. For most users, the default values produce the best possible mix of overhead and utility. However, you can change the settings for your specific needs. Important Always restart your web server after changing INI settings. Otherwise, they may not take effect immediately. Configuration order of precedence Here is a simple illustration of the order of precedence that the PHP agent follows for configuration. Server-side configuration is not applicable. The only values you can change in the UI for apps using the PHP agent are the app's alias and its Apdex-T value. With New Relic's PHP agent, API settings override per-directory configuration settings. Per-directory settings override the php.ini file settings. Server-side configuration is not applicable. Configuration file variables During installation, the newrelic-install script provides information about the configuration files it created or a list of files you need to edit. By default it will attempt to create a configuration file named newrelic.ini. In some cases, you may be instructed to add configuration options to your php.ini file. Only do this if necessary. Exactly which file you need to edit depends on how your particular version (or versions) of PHP were configured. The two most common configurations are: Use a single newrelic.ini file. This is usually the default if you have installed or compiled PHP yourself with no special options. Scan a given directory for all .ini files. If you are unsure which file to edit: From the command line, review the output of php -i. In a browser, review the output of a page containing the script: <?php phpinfo(); ?> Copy If the newrelic.ini file appears, use it. Variable scope Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined scope. The scope controls where the setting can be established or modified. The two scopes supported for New Relic settings are: SYSTEM: Values set globally in the global newrelic.ini file. PERDIR: Values set on a per-directory basis. Each can also be set at a more general level. Valid locations for each are: Can be set for: SYSTEM PERDIR Set in the global newrelic.ini file. Set on a per-directory basis. Important You cannot use ini_set() for New Relic settings. Variable type Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined type. The type specifies the syntax for the value you use. Variable type Formatting and contents String String values can contain any alphanumeric character and punctuation. The value is delimited by quotes. Boolean A logical true or false setting. Valid values are: For true or enabled: on, true, the number 1. For false or disabled: off, false, the number 0. Number Numeric values can only contain digits, plus a period to indicate floats. Unless otherwise stated, all numbers are integers, not floats. Duration A string value delimited by quotes that represent a time duration. Use character flags to delimit time components. If there are no flags, the time is in milliseconds. w\\ = weeks d\\ = days h\\ = hours m\\ = minutes s\\ = seconds ms\\ = milliseconds us\\ = microseconds Example durations: \"1w3d23h10m\"\\ = 1 week, 3 days, 23 hours, and 10 minutes \"5h30m\"\\ = 5 hours and 30 minutes \"500\"\\ = 500 milliseconds General configuration settings These settings are available in the newrelic.ini file. newrelic.appname (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"PHP Application\" This config option sets the application name that data is reported under in APM. We highly recommends that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in New Relic, so set this carefully. For all application-naming options, including per-directory settings, see Name your PHP application. The setting's value is a semicolon-separated list of up to three application names. The first name in the list is the primary application name. It must be unique for each account. The application name is used as a key into a cache. When using multiple names for an app, New Relic only uses the first name for caching. Therefore, each application name can only appear as the first element once. Caching example If you set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App2\" and later in the code set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App3\", the second one will appear not to work. It will report to App1 and App2 because of the caching. If you need overlapping application names, set the common application name in the second or third positions. For example: newrelic.appname=\"App2;App1\" and newrelic.appname=\"App3;App1\". This is useful, for example, when you want to track a superset of applications. newrelic.capture_params Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. To set this value programmatically, use the newrelic_capture_params() API function. If you pass sensitive information directly in the URL, keep this disabled. If set to true, this will enable the recording of parameters passed to a PHP script via the URL (everything after the ? in the URL) in transaction traces. These will appear under the Parameters dropdown when displaying transaction traces. newrelic.framework Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: (auto-detected) The New Relic PHP agent automatically detects the frameworks it supports, but problems may arise if you are using experimental new versions or if you have customized the framework. This setting disables automatic framework detection, instead telling the agent to attempt to name transactions according to the specified framework. Specifying \"no_framework\" will disable framework-related transaction naming entirely. Use any of the following values, as appropriate: \"cakephp\" \"codeigniter\" \"drupal\" (for Drupal 6 and 7) \"drupal8\" \"joomla\" \"kohana\" \"laravel\" \"magento\" \"magento2\" \"mediawiki\" \"silex\" \"symfony1\" \"symfony2\" (for Symfony 2 and 3) \"symfony4\" \"wordpress\" \"yii\" \"zend\" \"zend2\" (for Zend Framework 2 and 3) \"no_framework\" (to force no framework even if one was detected) If the framework auto-detection fails, this command will also fail. newrelic.ignored_params Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. Use the newrelic.ignored_params setting to specify a comma-separated list of parameter names to be excluded from the list of parameters sent to the New Relic servers. Enclose the string values with quote marks. If you enable parameter capturing with newrelic.capture_params, there may be parameters with sensitive user data you do not want to be captured by New Relic or visible in transaction traces. Use this to block the recording of this data. newrelic.license (REQUIRED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Notes: Introduced in agent version 3.0. Sets the New Relic license key to use. In a multi-tenant system this can be set on a per-directory basis. Tip When you upgrade from an old agent version to 3.0 or higher, the license will be removed from your daemon configuration file (with a comment explaining why) and stored in the file /etc/newrelic/upgrade_please.key. Copy the license out of that file and set it in your newrelic.ini file. Delete the upgrade_please.key file. newrelic.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the level of detail of messages sent to the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, include: error warning info verbose debug verbosedebug When reporting any agent issues to New Relic technical support, verbosedebug is the most useful setting. However, this can generate a lot of information very quickly, so avoid keeping the agent at verbosedebug level for longer than it takes to reproduce the problem you are experiencing. When reporting any agent issues to New Relic Technical Support, you may be asked to set this to a custom level, enabling debugging only for certain subsystems. Custom levels are beyond the scope of this document. newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 1 Notes: This used to be newrelic.transaction_tracer.top100. Sets the level of detail in a transaction trace: When set to 1, all server calls are traced. When set to 0, traces only include internally instrumented calls by New Relic and those defined by the user using newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom. The default level of 1 does have a performance impact. If you need to improve performance, try setting the detail level to 0. When not tracing all server calls, blocks of time in transaction traces will be labeled as uninstrumented time, and only certain functions (defined internally by the agent) are instrumented. Even when reporting all calls, there may be uninstrumented time in the traces. newrelic.high_security Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables high security for all applications. When high security is set to true, the following behaviors take effect: Data will not be sent to New Relic unless the newrelic-daemon is using a secure connection (HTTPS). If the PHP process spawns a newrelic-daemon, it will be configured to use HTTPS regardless of the value of newrelic.daemon.ssl. Raw query strings will never be gathered, regardless of the value of newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql. Request attributes will never be captured, regardless of the newrelic.attributes configuration settings. The newrelic_add_custom_parameter and newrelic_set_user_attributes API function will have no effect, and they will return false. The newrelic_record_custom_event API function will not submit any events to New Relic. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Caution If you change the newrelic.high_security setting, you must also change the security setting in the APM user interface. If the two settings do not match, then no data will be collected. For more information, see High security. newrelic.labels Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Adds tags. Example tags \"Server:One;Data Center:Primary\" Copy newrelic.process_host.display_name Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. Daemon .ini settings The values of these settings control the daemon startup. When the agent detects that the daemon needs to be started, it will convert these options into the appropriate command line options for the daemon. All of these settings mirror the settings in the newrelic.cfg file. They are repeated here to keep all of the .ini settings in one place. Each setting in newrelic.cfg has its counterpart here, with newrelic.daemon. as the prefix. For example, the ssl setting in newrelic.cfg is newrelic.daemon.ssl in an .ini file. Important If the file /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent ignores these settings, and the agent will not start the daemon automatically. For more information about ways to start the daemon and when to use an external configuration file, see PHP daemon startup modes. newrelic.daemon.app_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"5m\" or \"1h20m\" Default: \"10m\" Sets the elapsed time after which an application will be considered inactive. Inactive applications do not count against the maximum limit of 250 applications. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". A value of 0 will be interpreted as \"no timeout.\" This will result in new applications always counting towards the 250 application limit, as well as the daemon being unable to release a small amount of memory per application back to the operating system. Recommendation: Do not use this value unless New Relic Support requests it. Instead, for occasional background transactions, use a value of twice the interval. For example, for an hourly background job, set the timeout to 2 hours. newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon connecting an application. A value of 0 causes the agent to only make one attempt at connecting to the daemon. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". With this timeout set, the agent will not immediately drop a transaction when the daemon hasn't connected to the backend yet, but rather grant the daemon time to establish the connection. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 15s. Only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of connection problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. newrelic.daemon.auditlog Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" The setting specifies the name of an audit log, which will contain all of the data sent from the daemon to the New Relic servers, including the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, unencoded data for each request. This file cannot be the same file as the daemon log. Important This audit log can become very large, very quickly. Avoid using the newrelic.daemon.auditlog setting for extended periods of time. Its primary purpose is to allow system administrators to perform security reviews and to observe exactly what data transmits. newrelic.daemon.collector_host Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"collector.newrelic.com\" Sets the name and optional port of the collector host which the daemon will contact to verify your license key and send agent data. This is either just the name of the host or the name and port number in the form \"hostname:port\". Specifying a port number of 0 will use the default port, which is 80. Caution Do not change this value without guidance from New Relic Support. newrelic.daemon.dont_launch Scope: SYSTEM Type: Number Default: 0 If you prefer to have the daemon launched externally before the agent starts up, this value determines when the agent is allowed to start the daemon: 0: No restrictions are placed on daemon startup and the agent can start the daemon any time. 1: Non-command line (such as Apache or php-fpm) agents can start the daemon. 2: Only command line agents can start the daemon. 3: The agent will never start the daemon. Use this setting if you are configuring the daemon via newrelic.cfg and starting it outside of the agent. Important If /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent assumes the daemon is meant to be started by its startup script, not via the agent. This setting has no meaning to and does not appear in newrelic.cfg. newrelic.daemon.location Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/usr/bin/newrelic-daemon\" Sets the name of the daemon executable to launch. This variable identifies the full path to the daemon executable file. If the New Relic system was installed using the standard packages, the default location will be correct. If you have installed to a custom location using the tar distribution (and do not have permission to write to /usr/bin), then the daemon may reside at another location. This setting does not appear in the newrelic.cfg file as it is only relevant to PHP. Important On OpenSolaris, /usr is frequently a read-only file system. The default daemon location for OpenSolaris is /opt/newrelic/bin/newrelic-daemon. newrelic.daemon.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log\" Sets the name of the log file to record daemon specific log messages. This file must be writable by the daemon. The most common case is that the Apache user will end up starting the daemon when Apache itself starts up, thus you should ensure that the file is writable by whichever user runs the Apache process. Caution If the daemon log file is not writable, the daemon will not start automatically, which will prevent data from reporting. You can use write permissions to this file as a means of restricting who can start the daemon. newrelic.daemon.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the detail level for messages recorded to New Relic's daemon log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: error warning info debug The more verbose settings can generate a lot of information very quickly. When necessary, set debug for short periods of time to identify problems. newrelic.daemon.pidfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: (depends on OS) Sets the name of the file in which the daemon will record its process ID (pid). This file is used by the daemon startup and shutdown script to determine whether or not the daemon is already running. newrelic.daemon.address (alias for newrelic.daemon.port) Scope: SYSTEM Type: String or Number Default: \"@newrelic\" on Linux, \"/tmp/.newrelic.sock\" otherwise Tip From v9.2.0.247, the PHP agent supports a new setting, newrelic.daemon.address,which serves as an alias to newrelic.daemon.port. You can use either to specify the location of the New Relic PHP daemon. If both values are set, newrelic.daemon.address takes precedence. Sets the socket endpoint for agent to daemon communications. This can be specified in four ways. To use a specified file as a UNIX domain socket (UDS), provide an absolute path name as a string. This is the default on non-Linux systems. To use a standard TCP port, specify a number in the range 1 to 65534. To use an abstract socket, use the value @newrelic-daemon (available for agent version 5.2.0.141 or higher). This is the default on Linux systems. To connect to a daemon that is running on a different host (helpful for container environments), set this value to host:port, where host denotes either a host name or an IP, and port denotes a valid port number. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is available for agent version 9.2.0.247 or higher. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon (this only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts). If you use port numbers, Unix systems require that ports in the range 1 to 1023 require the daemon be run as the super-user. In case the daemon uses a non-standard port, this variable also sets the port number the agent will use for communicating with the daemon. Important If you're using the newrelic.cfg startup mechanism for the daemon, this setting and the address setting in that file must match. newrelic.daemon.proxy Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the host and user credentials to use as an egress proxy. This is only used if your site requires a proxy in order to access the New Relic data collection servers. It can take any of the following forms, depending on the proxy setup: hostname hostname:port user@hostname user@hostname:port user:password@hostname user:password@hostname:port proxytype://user:password@hostname:port A proxy type of HTTP is assumed unless another proxytype is specified. In that case, proxytype can be one of http, socks4, socks4a, or socks5. newrelic.daemon.ssl Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true This setting is ignored on PHP agent versions 8.0 and higher, and HTTPS will always be used to communicate with New Relic. On versions of the PHP agent versions lower than 8.0, controls whether or not communication with New Relic collectors should use a secure HTTP connection. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA bundle. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path is also set, the certificates in this file will be searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA path. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle is also set, it will be searched first followed by the certificates contained in newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.start_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon to start after a daemon launch was triggered. A value of 0 causes the agent to not wait. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\" and \"h\". The specified timeout value will be passed to the daemon via the --wait-for-port flag. This causes daemon startup to block until a socket is acquired or until the timeout is elapsed. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 2s to 5s. It is recommended to only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of daemon start problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. Transaction tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Set this to a comma-separated list of user defined functions or methods to instrument: \"myfunction,myclass::method,otherfunction\" Copy Internal PHP functions cannot have custom tracing. You can add to the list of custom functions with each PERDIR file, but you cannot remove a function or method that has already been added. If you want to programmatically add functions or methods to be instrumented, use the newrelic_add_custom_tracer() API function call. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables the transaction tracer. The tracer creates a detailed transaction trace for transactions that take more time than the threshold, as set by the newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold value. Only one transaction trace per application per harvest cycle is stored and it is always the slowest transaction during that cycle. Transaction traces are useful for diagnosing why a particular transaction was slow. Unless memory and performance are critical, they should almost never be disabled. Enabling this does have a very slight performance impact and does use more memory. For more information, see newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables requesting explain plans from MySQLi and PDO MySQL libraries for slow query calls. Explain plans will only be available when newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql is set to true and newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is not set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" Sets the threshold beyond which queries are considered \"slow\" and thus candidates for the Slow Queries page. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.internal_functions_enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables or disables support for tracing internal functions (that is, functions written in C and provided either via the PHP standard library or PECL extensions). When enabled, internal functions appear in transaction traces like functions written in PHP. Enabling this option may result in transactions being slower, especially when collecting many traces from PHP 5.x. Enabling this option is only recommended when specifically debugging performance issues where an internal function is suspected to be slow. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"obfuscated\" Sets how queries are recorded (if at all). When recording transaction traces internally, the full query for slow query calls is recorded. Sending this query to New Relic can have serious security implications, so by default, all database statements are obfuscated before being sent to New Relic. The obfuscation is not reversible, as it replaces strings and numbers in any query with question marks. The only things that survive intact are field names, not any of their values. If you are testing with data that is not sensitive and you need to see the raw queries in transaction traces, set this to \"raw\". If you do not want queries recorded at all, set this to \"off\". Important Always set this back to \"obfuscated\" or \"off\" in any production environment. newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable the Slow Queries feature. When enabled, it will: Record the top 10 slowest database queries per application per minute. Create a stack trace leading up to the query. If this variable is set to false or SQL recording is disabled, the New Relic agent does not gather any slow query data. newrelic.transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" This sets the threshold above which the agent will record the full PHP stack for transaction traces for which queries are being recorded. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" Stack traces can consume memory, so be careful of setting this value too low. This variable has no meaning if newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"apdex_f\" Use this variable to set the threshold beyond which transactions are eligible for being traced. Available values include: Use \"apdex_f\" to set the threshold to 4 times the application's apdex_t value. For more information, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. Use any other duration string to set a specific time threshold. Specify the duration as an absolute value and the unit of measurement. If none is specified, the unit defaults to millisecond. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.gather_input_queries Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable gathering of DQL input queries with Slow Queries and Transaction Traces. When enabled, these will appear along with slow queries and transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 0 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for web transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP web processes; it will not effect PHP CLI processes. To set a limit for CLI processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 100000 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for CLI transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP CLI processes; it will not effect PHP web processes. To set a limit for web processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web. Other tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control various tracer features. newrelic.cross_application_tracer.enabled Important A distributed tracing feature is available. Distributed tracing improves on cross application tracing and is recommended for monitoring activity in complex distributed systems. Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the cross application tracer. The cross application tracer inserts HTTP headers into outbound requests and the response in order to link together web transaction metrics and transaction traces between applications. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the PHP agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross-application tracing. Before enabling, read the transition guide to understand effects on New Relic features. Enable or disable distributed tracing. When the agent's transaction tracer and distributed tracing features are enabled, the agent will insert headers into outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic distributed tracing header that is attached to outbound requests, and to instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are attached to outbound requests. The New Relic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that do not support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over New Relic headers for distributed tracing. newrelic.span_events_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Span event reporting requires distributed tracing to be enabled. This option enables/disables the reporting of span events. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: \"\" Configures the Trace Observer used for Infinite Tracing. If empty, Infinite Tracing support will be disabled. This requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer Default: 443 Configures the TCP/IP port used to communicate with the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. This setting is ignored if newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host is empty. This setting will not usually need to be changed. newrelic.infinite_tracing.span_events.queue_size Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer (1000 or higher) Default: 100000 Sets the number of span events that can be queued for transmission to the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. The agent internally manages span events for Infinite Tracing in span batches. Those span batches can hold a maximum of 1000 spans. Therefore, the span events queue size cannot be lower than 1000, as otherwise not even a single span batch can be queued. If a queue size lower than 1000 is specified, the minimum size of 1000 is used. newrelic.error_collector.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the error collector. When enabled, the agent collects and reports PHP errors to the New Relic UI. The agent records only the single most severe error for each transaction, and up to 20 errors per harvest cycle. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. newrelic.error_collector.record_database_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When enabled, the agent collects errors returned by MySQL functions as if they were PHP errors. newrelic.error_collector.prioritize_api_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to assign the highest priority to errors identified through the newrelic_notice_error() API function. newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) A comma separated list of fully-qualified exception class names that the agent should ignore. When an unhandled exception occurs, the agent will perform the equivalent of $exception instanceof Class for each of the classes listed. If any of those checks returns true, the agent will not record an exception. Depending on the supported PHP release, these values are equivalent to disabling exception reporting: Supported PHP 5 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Exceptions Supported PHP 7 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Throwable newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer or a bitwise expression of PHP-defined error constants Default: 0 Sets the error levels for the PHP agent to ignore. The value for this setting uses similar syntax to PHP's error_reporting option. For example, to configure the PHP agent to ignore E_WARNING and E_ERROR level errors, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_WARNING | E_ERROR or newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = 3 To configure the PHP agent to ignore everything but E_WARNING, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_ALL & ~E_WARNING newrelic.framework.drupal.modules Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: In agents prior to version 3.0 the default for this value was false. Setting this option implied newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail = 1. To enable Drupal module tracking, set this to true. This option has the same performance impact as newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. It will enable the recording of Drupal module functions and call counts, and they will display under the Modules tab, much like web transactions. newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true To enable WordPress hook tracking, set this to true. It will enable the recording of WordPress hooks, plugins, and themes, and they will display under the WordPress tab in the New Relic UI. newrelic.webtransaction.name.files Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" This is the same as newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions, except it uses file names to name the web transaction. The file names can be standard POSIX regular expression to be used with PCRE; for example, \"controllers/actions/.*\". newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Unless the New Relic agent detects a specific framework, such as Drupal or Wordpress, web transactions are named after the initial PHP file; for example, article.php. When the initial file is a dispatcher, this naming scheme produces less than useful data. Use this variable to specify a list of functions that are the \"actions\" generated by the dispatcher. The name of the web transaction will be the first action function executed. Example dispatch function naming If index.php dispatches to functions named: login, logout, admin, show, and edit You would set this value to \"login,logout,admin,show,edit\". The web transactions will be named login, logout, etc. instead of /index.php (the initial file name). newrelic.webtransaction.name.remove_trailing_path Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false When enabled,this removes any content in the request URI after the script name. For example, this would remove the trailing /xyz/zy from /path/to/foo.php/xyz/zy. newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow sql traces. newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. Attribute settings This section lists the settings that affect attribute collection and reporting. newrelic.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the collection of attributes generated by the PHP agent or generated by the user through newrelic_add_custom_parameter(). This setting will take precedence over all other attribute configuration settings. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: True, except for browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Control which destinations receive attributes. These configuration settings will override the .include and .exclude settings. For more information on the destinations available, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.attributes.{include|exclude} Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) This is a family of configuration options that allow fine control over the destinations of attributes. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. Other .ini settings This section lists the remaining newrelic.ini settings. newrelic.enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: (none) Enable or disable the New Relic agent. By default the New Relic PHP agent is enabled for all directories. If you have multiple sites on your web server but only want the PHP agent to monitor specific ones: Make sure newrelic.enabled is set to true at the global (SYSTEM) level in your newrelic.ini file. Set newrelic.enabled to false for one or more specific sites on a per-directory basis (PERDIR). If you need to disable the agent globally, set the newrelic.enabled value to false in the newrelic.ini file. When the agent is globally disabled, it does not initialize completely. It assumes you are globally disabling it for a critical reason, and the agent will attempt to have as close to zero impact on PHP as possible. Important You cannot globally disable the agent and then selectively enable it on a per-directory basis by using .htaccess. newrelic.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/php_agent.log\" This identifies the file name for logging messages. This is useful for debugging any issues with the agent. Whatever you set this to, ensure that: The permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. The user that PHP runs as can write to the file. Usually this is the same user as the web server. newrelic.transaction_events.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report analytics event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. newrelic.error_collector.capture_events Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report error event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show Error analytics. newrelic.feature_flag Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This setting enables new and experimental features within the PHP agent. These flags are used to selectively enable features that are intended to be enabled by default in later versions of the PHP agent. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This enables auto-insertion of the JavaScript fragments for browser monitoring. When enabled will cause the agent to insert a header and a footer in HTML output that will generate metrics on page load timing for the end-user experience. For more information, see Page load timing in PHP. newrelic.guzzle.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables support for the Guzzle library when used with New Relic. PHP agent version 6.4 or higher: This setting is set to true by default. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: Introduced in PHP agent version 9.4 Enables the detection of frameworks and libraries when preloading is enabled. Preloading was introduced in PHP version 7.4. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection will only take effect when opcache.preload is set in the php.ini file.

      "body": "New Relic for PHP gives you several ways to change the application name that is reported to, and displayed in, New Relic. This document gives you an overview of those naming options. For a general overview of APM app naming (not PHP-specific), see Name your application. Set or change app name New Relic differentiates applications by their name. When you change the name an application reports as, New Relic creates a new application entity and breaks data continuity between the new and old entity. To change an application's name without breaking data continuity, use the UI alias-change option. Here are the ways to change your PHP application's name in New Relic: Configure newrelic.ini file using newrelic.appname: The recommended and most commonly used option. Set per-directory INI settings: Useful for when you have one web server serving multiple applications and want to have different settings or names for them. (Procedures for Apache, PHP-FPM, and NGINX in PHP-FPM are documented.) Change alias via UI: This changes only the alias in the UI, not the underlying app name being reported. (This option does not break data continuity in APM.) Change via API: An option if you have access to modify your application code, are okay with instrumenting it directly, and find the trace continuity implications of this call acceptable. Use multiple app names Important The ability to set multiple app names is only available in PHP agent versions 2.4 or higher. You can use multiple app names to aggregate data from several applications under the same name in APM (sometimes referred to as \"rolling up\" your data). For more about how multiple app names work, see Use multiple app names. For PHP, you can set up to three application names. The primary application name is first, and the second and third names are used for the more general data aggregation categories.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent supports distributed tracing (including W3C Trace Context, as of PHP Agent version 9.8), which lets you see the path that requests take as they travel through a distributed system. This document contains PHP-specific tips to enable distributed tracing for a PHP application or service. Enable distributed tracing for PHP Important When distributed tracing is enabled, it implicitly disables cross application tracing. The PHP agent will ignore the cross application tracing configuration value, and act as though this value is set to false. To enable or disable distributed tracing for the PHP agent: If applicable, update your PHP agent to support distributed tracing (version 8.4 or higher, although we recommend version 9.8 or higher for the most complete functionality). Make sure that the transaction tracer configuration option is enabled (default is true): newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true Copy Enable (or disable) distributed tracing for the PHP agent with the distributed_tracing_enabled configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy Set the transaction tracer threshold value to a suitable value. Recommendation: If you want to make all transactions eligible for a distributed trace, set this value to 0 seconds. If you are only interested in traces for longer running transactions, or if generating a trace for every transaction creates unacceptable application performance, set this value higher than 0 seconds. For example: newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold = 0 Copy Optionally, if only W3C Trace Context tracing is desired, the New Relic Distributed Tracing headers can be disabled with the newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header = 1 Enable spans with the configuration setting: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true Be sure to restart your web server (or other PHP SAPI) so the agent will pick up the newly configured values. Enable Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing (PHP agent version 9.12 or later) extends distributed tracing to collect your span data in a trace observer, which runs in a cluster of services in AWS called New Relic Edge. The PHP agent sends all your spans to the trace observer so they can be assembled into traces for you to view in New Relic. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and configure the additional settings below: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host= \"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" Leverage automatic distributed tracing instrumentation The PHP agent automatically will instrument a number of native PHP functions, as well as some third party HTTP clients, with distributed trace information. These include: PHP function file_get_contents PHP functions curl_exec and curl_multi_exec Guzzle 4, Guzzle 5, Guzzle 6 Drupal's drupal_http_request function Laravel's queue jobs Set trace detail level Distributed tracing support depends on the PHP agent's transaction tracer. When distributed tracing is enabled, a span is created for each segment seen by the transaction tracer. As spans are sampled, the PHP agent will prioritize spans related to external calls above other spans, which are then recorded in descending order of their duration. If you find that there are too many unimportant spans being reported for PHP function calls, you can reduce the detail of the transaction tracer by setting newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail to 0. You may then use the newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom configuration setting or the newrelic_add_custom_tracer API method to add trace segments and spans for the specific PHP function or methods you want to add to your traces. Important For PHP agent versions 8.4 to 8.7: When distributed tracing is enabled, these versions behave as if newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail is set to 0 (as described above), which results in PHP function calls not generating spans. To get spans related to PHP function calls, update to version 9.0 or higher. Manually instrument applications and services Important W3C Trace Context support was added in version 9.8. With this, the API for manually instrumenting applications has changed from the JSON payload related functions newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload), to the header array forms newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers) and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers). The JSON functions are now considered deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. If you're using an unsupported library, or have a non-HTTP based distributed system component (such as messaging queues), you can use the PHP agent API to manually identify transactions to be included in a distributed trace. This is a two step process: Modify your service or application to create or insert the distributed tracing data Modify your service or application to accept distributed trace data created by other transactions or requests. The following example uses a generic message/job queue. While the actual details will vary depending on what sort of system you're trying to add to a distributed trace, the core concepts are the same. Also, while we've used a job queue as an example, you can use these methods with any distributed system component. Tip When you create a payload or insert headers, you're telling New Relic you want this request or transaction or request to participate in a distributed trace. When you accept them, you're linking the current request or transaction with its parent request or transaction. For more information about using manual instrumentation to get more detail or to see connections between services, see the documentation about distributed tracing APIs. Header API Insert distributed trace headers Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to insert distributed trace headers into an array by using newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers, and then add those headers to the job's data: $outbound_headers = array(); if (newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers)) { // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the headers to the job data $job->setData('nr_dt_headers', $outbound_headers); // save the job $job->save(); } else { echo \"Unable to obtain distributed tracing headers\"; } Copy Tip Tip: The headers created via newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() are HTTP safe. This is step one: You've inserted the distributed trace headers. Accept the distributed tracing headers Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept distributed trace headers, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $inbound_headers = $job->getData('nr_dt_headers'); if($inbound_headers) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers); } $job->run(); } Copy Payload API (deprecated) Create a distributed trace payload Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to create a distributed trace payload using newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload, and then add that payload to the job's data: $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the payload data to the job data as a text json string $job->setData('dt_payload', $payload->Text()); // save the job $job->save(); Copy This is step one: You've created a distributed trace payload. Accept the distributed tracing payload Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept a distributed trace payload, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $payload = $job->getData('dt_payload'); if($payload) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload); } $job->run(); } Copy Optional: Use HTTP safe payload strings If you need to transport the payload via a mechanism that requires HTTP safe strings, (HTTP headers, URL query strings, POST fields, etc.), the API includes distributed tracing methods and functions that will create and accept HTTP safe versions of the strings. // create the HTTP safe payload string $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); $httpSafePayload = $payload->httpSafe(); // ... // accept the HTTP safe payload string newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload_httpsafe($httpSafePayload); Copy Command line PHP programs PHP programs run from the PHP command line are always sampled by the agent's distributed tracer. Depending on the programs you run, these processes could see an over-representation in your collection of distributed traces. In these situations, you can opt to disable command line instrumentation by using the per-directory newrelic.enabled setting in your newrelic.ini files.

To use browser monitoring with your PHP agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Use auto-instrumentation To configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with the browser monitoring script, add or edit the auto-instrumentation flag in your INI file.

To use browser monitoring in this situation, disable auto-instrumentation and manually insert the JavaScript header and footer into your templates. Manually instrument via agent API To manually configure browser monitoring, include the appropriate scripts in your pages. The New Relic PHP agent has an API to automatically generate the required JavaScript header and footer in place. Important Calls to the PHP agent API are conditional on the newrelic extension being loaded so that the PHP agent is running. If the agent is not running, calls to generate the JavaScript header and footer will result in errors, as the functions will not be defined. For more information, see: auto_instrument agent settings newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() Manually instrument for various frameworks This document does not provide detailed procedures to manually insert the Browser agent via the agent API. This is because there too many possible ways to construct a framework. The manual instrumentation examples show how to add instrumentation to frameworks that already support auto-instrumentation. If you are using another framework or modified versions of Drupal or WordPress, be sure to call the API functions for instrumentation at the right place. Insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() as part of the output page's <head> tag, preferably as the very first thing. As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples. WordPress This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a WordPress installation using the default twentyten theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/header.php. <body <?php body_class(); ?>> <div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"hfeed\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"masthead\"> ...

Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header right after the opening header tag in website home dir/drupal/themes/garland/page.tpl.php. <div id=\"container\" class=\"clear-block\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"logo-floater\"> ...

If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's Browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option.

To use browser monitoring in this situation, disable auto-instrumentation and manually insert the JavaScript header and footer into your templates. Manually instrument via agent API To manually configure browser monitoring, include the appropriate scripts in your pages. The New Relic PHP agent has an API to automatically generate the required JavaScript header and footer in place. Important Calls to the PHP agent API are conditional on the newrelic extension being loaded so that the PHP agent is running. If the agent is not running, calls to generate the JavaScript header and footer will result in errors, as the functions will not be defined. For more information, see: auto_instrument agent settings newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() Manually instrument for various frameworks This document does not provide detailed procedures to manually insert the Browser agent via the agent API. This is because there too many possible ways to construct a framework. The manual instrumentation examples show how to add instrumentation to frameworks that already support auto-instrumentation. If you are using another framework or modified versions of Drupal or WordPress, be sure to call the API functions for instrumentation at the right place. Insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() as part of the output page's <head> tag, preferably as the very first thing. As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent supports distributed tracing (including W3C Trace Context, as of PHP Agent version 9.8), which lets you see the path that requests take as they travel through a distributed system. This document contains PHP-specific tips to enable distributed tracing for a PHP application or service. Enable distributed tracing for PHP Important When distributed tracing is enabled, it implicitly disables cross application tracing. The PHP agent will ignore the cross application tracing configuration value, and act as though this value is set to false. To enable or disable distributed tracing for the PHP agent: If applicable, update your PHP agent to support distributed tracing (version 8.4 or higher, although we recommend version 9.8 or higher for the most complete functionality). Make sure that the transaction tracer configuration option is enabled (default is true): newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true Copy Enable (or disable) distributed tracing for the PHP agent with the distributed_tracing_enabled configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy Set the transaction tracer threshold value to a suitable value. Recommendation: If you want to make all transactions eligible for a distributed trace, set this value to 0 seconds. If you are only interested in traces for longer running transactions, or if generating a trace for every transaction creates unacceptable application performance, set this value higher than 0 seconds. For example: newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold = 0 Copy Optionally, if only W3C Trace Context tracing is desired, the New Relic Distributed Tracing headers can be disabled with the newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header = 1 Enable spans with the configuration setting: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true Be sure to restart your web server (or other PHP SAPI) so the agent will pick up the newly configured values. Enable Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing (PHP agent version 9.12 or later) extends distributed tracing to collect your span data in a trace observer, which runs in a cluster of services in AWS called New Relic Edge. The PHP agent sends all your spans to the trace observer so they can be assembled into traces for you to view in New Relic. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and configure the additional settings below: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host= \"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" Leverage automatic distributed tracing instrumentation The PHP agent automatically will instrument a number of native PHP functions, as well as some third party HTTP clients, with distributed trace information. These include: PHP function file_get_contents PHP functions curl_exec and curl_multi_exec Guzzle 4, Guzzle 5, Guzzle 6 Drupal's drupal_http_request function Laravel's queue jobs Set trace detail level Distributed tracing support depends on the PHP agent's transaction tracer. When distributed tracing is enabled, a span is created for each segment seen by the transaction tracer. As spans are sampled, the PHP agent will prioritize spans related to external calls above other spans, which are then recorded in descending order of their duration. If you find that there are too many unimportant spans being reported for PHP function calls, you can reduce the detail of the transaction tracer by setting newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail to 0. You may then use the newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom configuration setting or the newrelic_add_custom_tracer API method to add trace segments and spans for the specific PHP function or methods you want to add to your traces. Important For PHP agent versions 8.4 to 8.7: When distributed tracing is enabled, these versions behave as if newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail is set to 0 (as described above), which results in PHP function calls not generating spans. To get spans related to PHP function calls, update to version 9.0 or higher. Manually instrument applications and services Important W3C Trace Context support was added in version 9.8. With this, the API for manually instrumenting applications has changed from the JSON payload related functions newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload), to the header array forms newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers) and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers). The JSON functions are now considered deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. If you're using an unsupported library, or have a non-HTTP based distributed system component (such as messaging queues), you can use the PHP agent API to manually identify transactions to be included in a distributed trace. This is a two step process: Modify your service or application to create or insert the distributed tracing data Modify your service or application to accept distributed trace data created by other transactions or requests. The following example uses a generic message/job queue. While the actual details will vary depending on what sort of system you're trying to add to a distributed trace, the core concepts are the same. Also, while we've used a job queue as an example, you can use these methods with any distributed system component. Tip When you create a payload or insert headers, you're telling New Relic you want this request or transaction or request to participate in a distributed trace. When you accept them, you're linking the current request or transaction with its parent request or transaction. For more information about using manual instrumentation to get more detail or to see connections between services, see the documentation about distributed tracing APIs. Header API Insert distributed trace headers Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to insert distributed trace headers into an array by using newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers, and then add those headers to the job's data: $outbound_headers = array(); if (newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers)) { // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the headers to the job data $job->setData('nr_dt_headers', $outbound_headers); // save the job $job->save(); } else { echo \"Unable to obtain distributed tracing headers\"; } Copy Tip Tip: The headers created via newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() are HTTP safe.

To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the PHP agent. To use browser monitoring with your PHP agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Use auto-instrumentation To configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with the browser monitoring script, add or edit the auto-instrumentation flag in your INI file. The PHP agent will automatically inject the browser monitoring's JS snippet into your pages. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument=1 Copy Auto-instrumentation does not work when the HTTP header field Content-Length is set. To use browser monitoring in this situation, disable auto-instrumentation and manually insert the JavaScript header and footer into your templates. Manually instrument via agent API To manually configure browser monitoring, include the appropriate scripts in your pages. The New Relic PHP agent has an API to automatically generate the required JavaScript header and footer in place. Important Calls to the PHP agent API are conditional on the newrelic extension being loaded so that the PHP agent is running. If the agent is not running, calls to generate the JavaScript header and footer will result in errors, as the functions will not be defined. For more information, see: auto_instrument agent settings newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() Manually instrument for various frameworks This document does not provide detailed procedures to manually insert the Browser agent via the agent API. This is because there too many possible ways to construct a framework. The manual instrumentation examples show how to add instrumentation to frameworks that already support auto-instrumentation. If you are using another framework or modified versions of Drupal or WordPress, be sure to call the API functions for instrumentation at the right place. Insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() as part of the output page's <head> tag, preferably as the very first thing. As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples. WordPress This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a WordPress installation using the default twentyten theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/header.php. <body <?php body_class(); ?>> <div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"hfeed\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"masthead\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the end user monitoring footer in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/footer.php. ... </div><!-- #site-generator --> </div><!-- #colophon --> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> </div><!-- #footer --> Copy Drupal This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a Drupal installation using the default garland theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header right after the opening header tag in website home dir/drupal/themes/garland/page.tpl.php. <div id=\"container\" class=\"clear-block\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"logo-floater\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the footer right before the last closing layout tag: ... </div> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> <!-- /layout --> <?php print $closure ?> </body> </html> Copy Important In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's Browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent supports distributed tracing (including W3C Trace Context, as of PHP Agent version 9.8), which lets you see the path that requests take as they travel through a distributed system. This document contains PHP-specific tips to enable distributed tracing for a PHP application or service. Enable distributed tracing for PHP Important When distributed tracing is enabled, it implicitly disables cross application tracing. The PHP agent will ignore the cross application tracing configuration value, and act as though this value is set to false. To enable or disable distributed tracing for the PHP agent: If applicable, update your PHP agent to support distributed tracing (version 8.4 or higher, although we recommend version 9.8 or higher for the most complete functionality). Make sure that the transaction tracer configuration option is enabled (default is true): newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true Copy Enable (or disable) distributed tracing for the PHP agent with the distributed_tracing_enabled configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy Set the transaction tracer threshold value to a suitable value. Recommendation: If you want to make all transactions eligible for a distributed trace, set this value to 0 seconds. If you are only interested in traces for longer running transactions, or if generating a trace for every transaction creates unacceptable application performance, set this value higher than 0 seconds. For example: newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold = 0 Copy Optionally, if only W3C Trace Context tracing is desired, the New Relic Distributed Tracing headers can be disabled with the newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header = 1 Enable spans with the configuration setting: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true Be sure to restart your web server (or other PHP SAPI) so the agent will pick up the newly configured values. Enable Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing (PHP agent version 9.12 or later) extends distributed tracing to collect your span data in a trace observer, which runs in a cluster of services in AWS called New Relic Edge. The PHP agent sends all your spans to the trace observer so they can be assembled into traces for you to view in New Relic. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and configure the additional settings below: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host= \"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" Leverage automatic distributed tracing instrumentation The PHP agent automatically will instrument a number of native PHP functions, as well as some third party HTTP clients, with distributed trace information. These include: PHP function file_get_contents PHP functions curl_exec and curl_multi_exec Guzzle 4, Guzzle 5, Guzzle 6 Drupal's drupal_http_request function Laravel's queue jobs Set trace detail level Distributed tracing support depends on the PHP agent's transaction tracer. When distributed tracing is enabled, a span is created for each segment seen by the transaction tracer. As spans are sampled, the PHP agent will prioritize spans related to external calls above other spans, which are then recorded in descending order of their duration. If you find that there are too many unimportant spans being reported for PHP function calls, you can reduce the detail of the transaction tracer by setting newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail to 0. You may then use the newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom configuration setting or the newrelic_add_custom_tracer API method to add trace segments and spans for the specific PHP function or methods you want to add to your traces. Important For PHP agent versions 8.4 to 8.7: When distributed tracing is enabled, these versions behave as if newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail is set to 0 (as described above), which results in PHP function calls not generating spans. To get spans related to PHP function calls, update to version 9.0 or higher. Manually instrument applications and services Important W3C Trace Context support was added in version 9.8. With this, the API for manually instrumenting applications has changed from the JSON payload related functions newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload), to the header array forms newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers) and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers). The JSON functions are now considered deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. If you're using an unsupported library, or have a non-HTTP based distributed system component (such as messaging queues), you can use the PHP agent API to manually identify transactions to be included in a distributed trace. This is a two step process: Modify your service or application to create or insert the distributed tracing data Modify your service or application to accept distributed trace data created by other transactions or requests. The following example uses a generic message/job queue. While the actual details will vary depending on what sort of system you're trying to add to a distributed trace, the core concepts are the same. Also, while we've used a job queue as an example, you can use these methods with any distributed system component. Tip When you create a payload or insert headers, you're telling New Relic you want this request or transaction or request to participate in a distributed trace. When you accept them, you're linking the current request or transaction with its parent request or transaction. For more information about using manual instrumentation to get more detail or to see connections between services, see the documentation about distributed tracing APIs. Header API Insert distributed trace headers Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to insert distributed trace headers into an array by using newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers, and then add those headers to the job's data: $outbound_headers = array(); if (newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers)) { // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the headers to the job data $job->setData('nr_dt_headers', $outbound_headers); // save the job $job->save(); } else { echo \"Unable to obtain distributed tracing headers\"; } Copy Tip Tip: The headers created via newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() are HTTP safe. This is step one: You've inserted the distributed trace headers. Accept the distributed tracing headers Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept distributed trace headers, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $inbound_headers = $job->getData('nr_dt_headers'); if($inbound_headers) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers); } $job->run(); } Copy Payload API (deprecated) Create a distributed trace payload Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to create a distributed trace payload using newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload, and then add that payload to the job's data: $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the payload data to the job data as a text json string $job->setData('dt_payload', $payload->Text()); // save the job $job->save(); Copy This is step one: You've created a distributed trace payload. Accept the distributed tracing payload Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept a distributed trace payload, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $payload = $job->getData('dt_payload'); if($payload) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload); } $job->run(); } Copy Optional: Use HTTP safe payload strings If you need to transport the payload via a mechanism that requires HTTP safe strings, (HTTP headers, URL query strings, POST fields, etc.), the API includes distributed tracing methods and functions that will create and accept HTTP safe versions of the strings. // create the HTTP safe payload string $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); $httpSafePayload = $payload->httpSafe(); // ... // accept the HTTP safe payload string newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload_httpsafe($httpSafePayload); Copy Command line PHP programs PHP programs run from the PHP command line are always sampled by the agent's distributed tracer. Depending on the programs you run, these processes could see an over-representation in your collection of distributed traces. In these situations, you can opt to disable command line instrumentation by using the per-directory newrelic.enabled setting in your newrelic.ini files.

      "body": "With the PHP agent, you can add browser monitoring to your pages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the PHP agent. To use browser monitoring with your PHP agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Use auto-instrumentation To configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with the browser monitoring script, add or edit the auto-instrumentation flag in your INI file. The PHP agent will automatically inject the browser monitoring's JS snippet into your pages. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument=1 Copy Auto-instrumentation does not work when the HTTP header field Content-Length is set. To use browser monitoring in this situation, disable auto-instrumentation and manually insert the JavaScript header and footer into your templates. Manually instrument via agent API To manually configure browser monitoring, include the appropriate scripts in your pages. The New Relic PHP agent has an API to automatically generate the required JavaScript header and footer in place. Important Calls to the PHP agent API are conditional on the newrelic extension being loaded so that the PHP agent is running. If the agent is not running, calls to generate the JavaScript header and footer will result in errors, as the functions will not be defined. For more information, see: auto_instrument agent settings newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() Manually instrument for various frameworks This document does not provide detailed procedures to manually insert the Browser agent via the agent API. This is because there too many possible ways to construct a framework. The manual instrumentation examples show how to add instrumentation to frameworks that already support auto-instrumentation. If you are using another framework or modified versions of Drupal or WordPress, be sure to call the API functions for instrumentation at the right place. Insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() as part of the output page's <head> tag, preferably as the very first thing. As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples. WordPress This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a WordPress installation using the default twentyten theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/header.php. <body <?php body_class(); ?>> <div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"hfeed\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"masthead\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the end user monitoring footer in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/footer.php. ... </div><!-- #site-generator --> </div><!-- #colophon --> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> </div><!-- #footer --> Copy Drupal This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a Drupal installation using the default garland theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header right after the opening header tag in website home dir/drupal/themes/garland/page.tpl.php. <div id=\"container\" class=\"clear-block\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"logo-floater\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the footer right before the last closing layout tag: ... </div> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> <!-- /layout --> <?php print $closure ?> </body> </html> Copy Important In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's Browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option. For how to use the API to disable browser monitoring, see newrelic_disable_autorum().

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent supports distributed tracing (including W3C Trace Context, as of PHP Agent version 9.8), which lets you see the path that requests take as they travel through a distributed system. This document contains PHP-specific tips to enable distributed tracing for a PHP application or service. Enable distributed tracing for PHP Important When distributed tracing is enabled, it implicitly disables cross application tracing. The PHP agent will ignore the cross application tracing configuration value, and act as though this value is set to false. To enable or disable distributed tracing for the PHP agent: If applicable, update your PHP agent to support distributed tracing (version 8.4 or higher, although we recommend version 9.8 or higher for the most complete functionality). Make sure that the transaction tracer configuration option is enabled (default is true): newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true Copy Enable (or disable) distributed tracing for the PHP agent with the distributed_tracing_enabled configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy Set the transaction tracer threshold value to a suitable value. Recommendation: If you want to make all transactions eligible for a distributed trace, set this value to 0 seconds. If you are only interested in traces for longer running transactions, or if generating a trace for every transaction creates unacceptable application performance, set this value higher than 0 seconds. For example: newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold = 0 Copy Optionally, if only W3C Trace Context tracing is desired, the New Relic Distributed Tracing headers can be disabled with the newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header = 1 Enable spans with the configuration setting: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true Be sure to restart your web server (or other PHP SAPI) so the agent will pick up the newly configured values. Enable Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing (PHP agent version 9.12 or later) extends distributed tracing to collect your span data in a trace observer, which runs in a cluster of services in AWS called New Relic Edge. The PHP agent sends all your spans to the trace observer so they can be assembled into traces for you to view in New Relic. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and configure the additional settings below: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host= \"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" Leverage automatic distributed tracing instrumentation The PHP agent automatically will instrument a number of native PHP functions, as well as some third party HTTP clients, with distributed trace information. These include: PHP function file_get_contents PHP functions curl_exec and curl_multi_exec Guzzle 4, Guzzle 5, Guzzle 6 Drupal's drupal_http_request function Laravel's queue jobs Set trace detail level Distributed tracing support depends on the PHP agent's transaction tracer. When distributed tracing is enabled, a span is created for each segment seen by the transaction tracer. As spans are sampled, the PHP agent will prioritize spans related to external calls above other spans, which are then recorded in descending order of their duration. If you find that there are too many unimportant spans being reported for PHP function calls, you can reduce the detail of the transaction tracer by setting newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail to 0. You may then use the newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom configuration setting or the newrelic_add_custom_tracer API method to add trace segments and spans for the specific PHP function or methods you want to add to your traces. Important For PHP agent versions 8.4 to 8.7: When distributed tracing is enabled, these versions behave as if newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail is set to 0 (as described above), which results in PHP function calls not generating spans. To get spans related to PHP function calls, update to version 9.0 or higher. Manually instrument applications and services Important W3C Trace Context support was added in version 9.8. With this, the API for manually instrumenting applications has changed from the JSON payload related functions newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload), to the header array forms newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers) and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers). The JSON functions are now considered deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. If you're using an unsupported library, or have a non-HTTP based distributed system component (such as messaging queues), you can use the PHP agent API to manually identify transactions to be included in a distributed trace. This is a two step process: Modify your service or application to create or insert the distributed tracing data Modify your service or application to accept distributed trace data created by other transactions or requests. The following example uses a generic message/job queue. While the actual details will vary depending on what sort of system you're trying to add to a distributed trace, the core concepts are the same. Also, while we've used a job queue as an example, you can use these methods with any distributed system component. Tip When you create a payload or insert headers, you're telling New Relic you want this request or transaction or request to participate in a distributed trace. When you accept them, you're linking the current request or transaction with its parent request or transaction. For more information about using manual instrumentation to get more detail or to see connections between services, see the documentation about distributed tracing APIs. Header API Insert distributed trace headers Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to insert distributed trace headers into an array by using newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers, and then add those headers to the job's data: $outbound_headers = array(); if (newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers)) { // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the headers to the job data $job->setData('nr_dt_headers', $outbound_headers); // save the job $job->save(); } else { echo \"Unable to obtain distributed tracing headers\"; } Copy Tip Tip: The headers created via newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() are HTTP safe. This is step one: You've inserted the distributed trace headers. Accept the distributed tracing headers Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept distributed trace headers, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $inbound_headers = $job->getData('nr_dt_headers'); if($inbound_headers) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers); } $job->run(); } Copy Payload API (deprecated) Create a distributed trace payload Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to create a distributed trace payload using newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload, and then add that payload to the job's data: $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the payload data to the job data as a text json string $job->setData('dt_payload', $payload->Text()); // save the job $job->save(); Copy This is step one: You've created a distributed trace payload. Accept the distributed tracing payload Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept a distributed trace payload, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $payload = $job->getData('dt_payload'); if($payload) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload); } $job->run(); } Copy Optional: Use HTTP safe payload strings If you need to transport the payload via a mechanism that requires HTTP safe strings, (HTTP headers, URL query strings, POST fields, etc.), the API includes distributed tracing methods and functions that will create and accept HTTP safe versions of the strings. // create the HTTP safe payload string $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); $httpSafePayload = $payload->httpSafe(); // ... // accept the HTTP safe payload string newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload_httpsafe($httpSafePayload); Copy Command line PHP programs PHP programs run from the PHP command line are always sampled by the agent's distributed tracer. Depending on the programs you run, these processes could see an over-representation in your collection of distributed traces. In these situations, you can opt to disable command line instrumentation by using the per-directory newrelic.enabled setting in your newrelic.ini files.

This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

      "body": "The PHP agent captures special metrics for Drupal websites. When these metrics are collected, a Drupal tab appears in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select a Drupal app). Configuration The collection of Drupal-specific metrics can be controlled by newrelic.framework.drupal.modules. It is enabled by default (in versions 3.0 or higher), and can be disabled with: newrelic.framework.drupal.modules = 0 Copy Though this setting uses the word \"modules,\" it controls the collection of all Drupal metrics: modules, views, and hooks. Metrics The PHP agent collects metrics for the following: Modules: Versions 2.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal module. In versions 3.5 or higher, time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. In previous versions, time was calculated from functions from a file with the \".module\" extension where the file name and function prefix were a match. Hooks: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. Views: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within a view's view::execute method. Drupal and Browser instrumentation In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the New Relic Browser JavaScript is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Cron tasks Drupal supports periodically executing tasks to perform routine maintenance or similar work on behalf of installed Drupal modules. These tasks can be run without any manual involvement beyond the initial configuration. Commonly, these are referred to as cron tasks. Starting in version 4.3, the New Relic PHP agent detects the execution of these tasks and automatically marks them as background transactions regardless of how they were started.

For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

A WordPress page appears in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select a WordPress app). Configuration You can control which WordPress-specific metrics your app sends to New Relic by using the PHP agent's ini setting newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks. This is enabled by default in versions 5.3 or higher, and it can be disabled with: newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks = false Copy Although this setting uses the word .hooks, it controls all WordPress metrics sent to New Relic, including hooks, plugins, and themes. Metrics The PHP agent receives metrics for the following: Hooks: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions apply_filters, apply_filters_ref_array, do_action, and do_action_ref_array. Plugins and themes: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress plugin and theme. Time is calculated from the dispatch functions for hooks. Integration with New Relic partners By integrating your WordPress application with APM, you can view performance directly from your WordPress app's Administration page. For example, W3 Total Cache is one of New Relic's Connect partners that specializes in WordPress apps. WordPress plugin for browser monitoring Signing up for a New Relic account and adding browser monitoring to your WordPress site is fast and easy with the browser monitoring plugin for WordPress. The plugin and our browser monitoring do not require the special access required to install our PHP agent. This makes them generally compatible with all WordPress hosting providers. In addition, the WordPress plugin is supported by the authors and the WordPress community.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine.

      "body": "If you install New Relic for WordPress websites, the PHP agent receives additional metrics. A WordPress page appears in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select a WordPress app). Configuration You can control which WordPress-specific metrics your app sends to New Relic by using the PHP agent's ini setting newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks. This is enabled by default in versions 5.3 or higher, and it can be disabled with: newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks = false Copy Although this setting uses the word .hooks, it controls all WordPress metrics sent to New Relic, including hooks, plugins, and themes. Metrics The PHP agent receives metrics for the following: Hooks: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions apply_filters, apply_filters_ref_array, do_action, and do_action_ref_array. Plugins and themes: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress plugin and theme. Time is calculated from the dispatch functions for hooks. Integration with New Relic partners By integrating your WordPress application with APM, you can view performance directly from your WordPress app's Administration page. For example, W3 Total Cache is one of New Relic's Connect partners that specializes in WordPress apps. WordPress plugin for browser monitoring Signing up for a New Relic account and adding browser monitoring to your WordPress site is fast and easy with the browser monitoring plugin for WordPress. The plugin and our browser monitoring do not require the special access required to install our PHP agent. This makes them generally compatible with all WordPress hosting providers. In addition, the WordPress plugin is supported by the authors and the WordPress community.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

Metrics The PHP agent receives metrics for the following: Hooks: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions apply_filters, apply_filters_ref_array, do_action, and do_action_ref_array. Plugins and themes: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress plugin and theme. Time is calculated from the dispatch functions for hooks. Integration with New Relic partners By integrating your WordPress application with APM, you can view performance directly from your WordPress app's Administration page. For example, W3 Total Cache is one of New Relic's Connect partners that specializes in WordPress apps. WordPress plugin for browser monitoring Signing up for a New Relic account and adding browser monitoring to your WordPress site is fast and easy with the browser monitoring plugin for WordPress. The plugin and our browser monitoring do not require the special access required to install our PHP agent. This makes them generally compatible with all WordPress hosting providers. In addition, the WordPress plugin is supported by the authors and the WordPress community.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

When these metrics are collected, a Drupal tab appears in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select a Drupal app). Configuration The collection of Drupal-specific metrics can be controlled by newrelic.framework.drupal.modules. It is enabled by default (in versions 3.0 or higher), and can be disabled with: newrelic.framework.drupal.modules = 0 Copy Though this setting uses the word \"modules,\" it controls the collection of all Drupal metrics: modules, views, and hooks. Metrics The PHP agent collects metrics for the following: Modules: Versions 2.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal module. In versions 3.5 or higher, time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. In previous versions, time was calculated from functions from a file with the \".module\" extension where the file name and function prefix were a match. Hooks: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. Views: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within a view's view::execute method. Drupal and Browser instrumentation In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the New Relic Browser JavaScript is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Cron tasks Drupal supports periodically executing tasks to perform routine maintenance or similar work on behalf of installed Drupal modules. These tasks can be run without any manual involvement beyond the initial configuration. Commonly, these are referred to as cron tasks. Starting in version 4.3, the New Relic PHP agent detects the execution of these tasks and automatically marks them as background transactions regardless of how they were started.

After enabling Browser injection, you can view Browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and Browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Java agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. New Relic One dashboards The Java agent sends default events and attributes to dashboards, or you can run NRQL queries in the query builder. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported.

Alert your team when errors or problems occur before they affect your users Track performance after a deploy Drill down into performance details Examine code-level transaction traces Examine database query traces Examine error traces Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP) For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

To request instance-level information from additional datastores, get support at support.newrelic.com. Hosting services You can install the Java agent on a variety of hosting services, including ones not listed below. Here are detailed installation guides for particular hosting services: Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment Heroku Asynchronous instrumentation For supported frameworks, the Java agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, you can use the Java agent API to extend this instrumentation. Other instrumented features EJB Session Beans 3.0 or higher JMX JSP (Java Server Pages) 2.0 to 2.2 Scala 2.9.3 to 2.13.x Connect the agent to other New Relic products The Java agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Java agent automatically injects the Browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling Browser injection, you can view Browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and Browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Java agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. New Relic One dashboards The Java agent sends default events and attributes to dashboards, or you can run NRQL queries in the query builder. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Alert your team when errors or problems occur before they affect your users Track performance after a deploy Drill down into performance details Examine code-level transaction traces Examine database query traces Examine error traces Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP) For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Whenever possible, include hyperlinks where relevant within the text itself. Avoid creating lists of doc links in the For more help section, because it is harder for future writers to determine why they matter. Tip If you're linking to the product, see our style guide page on UI paths. Link text Follow these guidelines when writing text for hyperlinks: Labels: Make sure each link in the document has a unique, meaningful text label. Do not use the same text string to label different links. Location: Include a clear, concise text label to identify where the link goes. Give extra context if you're linking to an external site. Why are you sending someone there? Click here: Do not use \"click here\" or other meaningless link labels. \"Link test:\" Read just the links, without the surrounding text. Can each stand alone as a clear description of where the link goes if that is all the user looks at on the page? Avoid URL prefixes: If you're sending users to an address where you want to use the URL as the link text, drop the https: and www. prefixes from the link text. For example, [github.com](https://github.com) not [https://github.com/](https://github.com). Or [github.com/newrelic/docs-website](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/) not [https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/). Take the link test for these three examples. The last is the best for readers looking for information on configuring PHP, because the link clearly identifies it, without having to read anything else on the page. Quality \"Link test\" example Bad To learn more about renaming your PHP app, click here. Okay To learn more about renaming your PHP app, see New Relic's config docs. Good To learn more about renaming your PHP app, use the PHP agent (newrelic.ini) settings. Support links Never include a hyperlink to the Support email address. This prevents spam and ensures customers use the ticket submission form to create tickets so they receive the correct support priority. If you need to tell customers to contact support, use this instead: Get support at [support.newrelic.com](support.newrelic.com). Copy Docs site (\"internal\") links When creating links to other documents on the Docs site, include only the path from /docs forward. Do not include https://docs.newrelic.com, or the site will treat it as an external link. Here is an example: [/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-newrelic-ini-settings](PHP agent (newrelic.ini) settings Copy Anchor links If your link includes an anchor (for example, #inivar-scope), use the complete, current doc path it uses. Some browsers do not retain anchors with redirects. When creating or editing an HTML id for an anchor link, follow these guidelines: Only use lower case when creating new IDs. Use hyphens - to separate words. Don't use _ underscores. When reorganizing a doc, try to preserve incoming anchor links where possible. Be mindful that when you delete a level two heading ##, it will break any links to that heading. Avoid changing an existing anchor ID, because we may be monitoring traffic to it from our internal New Relic account. External links When creating links to websites outside the docs.newrelic.com subdomain (including newrelic.com, one.newrelic.com, discuss.newrelic.com), the Docs site automatically includes code that opens the link in a new tab. In addition to the link text guidelines in this doc, here are some other things to keep in mind when linking to external sites: Think about the best way to future-proof your links. If possible, point to a top-level domain, but not if it reduces the usefulness of the link. How stable is the content you're linking to? Is the URL likely to change? Make sure your link is as useful as possible. What value are you trying to add to the document? Can that information be shared in another way? Help the reader understand why you're linking to this external source. Is it a useful reference, such as a list of time zones? Is it a way to save someone time, such as linking directly to a hard-to-find file? Make sure that your link is generally accessible. Are you linking to an external site that requires authentication, such as a private GitHub repo? Linking to an arbitrary (non-heading, non-collapser-entry) section in a doc H2 and H3 headings and collapsers have their own built-in IDs that you can link to. But sometimes you may want to link to a paragraph or to a table entry. In general, avoid this, and instead, link to headings and collapsers. Occasionally it's useful to link to a specific entry in a table, or a very important paragraph in a conceptual explanation. To do that, place a <span> tag around some text, using this format: <span id=\"name\">your text</span> Copy And then link to it using the standard anchor link format.",

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings.

To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully.

Please contact http://support.newrelic.com and report the above error. We have also created a tar file with log files and other system info that can help solve the problem. Copy Failure with the manual install process You used the manual install process with the install utility nrmaninstall.php, or you followed the manual instructions, and then you encountered something similar to this: $ sudo cp ./agent/x86_64/newrelic-20121212.so /usr/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20121212/ cp: /usr/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20121212/newrelic-20121212.so: Operation not permitted $ sudo cp ./daemon/newrelic-daemon.x86_64 /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon cp: /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon: Operation not permitted Copy Solution If necessary, you can install the PHP agent by disabling Apple's System Integrity Protection (SIP). This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds.

There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status.

Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully. Examples Record a 100 millisecond response time function example() { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available newrelic_custom_metric(\"Custom/custom-metric-name\", 100.00); } } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

This often occurs because the supported framework's default dispatching method has been modified (often by a plugin) or is no longer being used. If that happens, New Relic may not be able to detect or hook into the framework's dispatcher, and it will not be able to provide a meaningful transaction naming structure.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).

Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

Cause New Relic probably cannot accurately detect or hook into your specific framework. This often occurs because the supported framework's default dispatching method has been modified (often by a plugin) or is no longer being used. If that happens, New Relic may not be able to detect or hook into the framework's dispatcher, and it will not be able to provide a meaningful transaction naming structure.

      "body": "To take full advantage of our latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Python agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Python agent release notes. Update with Python package index (PyPi) The Python agent package is listed on PyPi at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic. To update with a specific package, follow the corresponding instructions: Python package Installation procedures pip To update the newrelic package directly from PyPi, run: pip install --upgrade newrelic Copy If you have New Relic in your requirements.txt file, you can do a mass update of all required packages by running: pip install -r requirements.txt Copy easy_install To update using easy_install, run: easy_install --upgrade newrelic Copy Tip We recommend using pip rather than using easy_install, because pip will correctly remove old versions when updating the agent software. buildout Install the package by creating an appropriate section for the newrelic package using the zc.recipe.egg recipe. Download package manually To manually download the New Relic Python package: Remove the current New Relic package. Download the new package, then follow the Python agent installation procedures. Tip We recommend using pip rather than using manual installation, because pip will correctly remove old versions when updating the agent software. Python agent versions not supported End of life notification: As of January 26, 2015, we will no longer accept data from Python agent versions earlier than 2.42.0. These agent versions use an out-of-date protocol when communicating with our data collection services. In addition, many of these versions contain a potential security issue where they may incorrectly send sensitive data to our data collector. Update unsupported agent versions Important If you are updating from an older agent version, including major version jumps, review the following list for changes in functionality. Migration Comments 4.2.0.100 and higher Release notes: Python agent 4.2.0.100 Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Set with the Python agent config file. 4.0.0.99 Release notes: Python agent 4.0.0.99 Previously deprecated APIs removed: Transaction.add_user_attribute (use Transaction.add_custom_parameter) Transaction.add_user_attributes (use Transaction.add_custom_parameters) wrap_callable (use FunctionWrapper) Removed support for Python 2.6 and Python 3.3: Python 2.6 and Python 3.3 are no longer supported. Recommendation: Update your application to a supported version of Python in order to continue to receive updates to the Python agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3: These are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. 3.0.0.89 Release notes: Python agent 3.0.0.89 Previously deprecated APIs removed: transaction (use current_transaction) name_transaction (use set_transaction_name) Application.record_metric (use Application.record_custom_metric) Application.record_metrics (use Application.record_custom_metrics) Transaction.record_metric (use Transaction.record_custom_metric) Transaction.name_transaction (use Transaction.set_transaction_name) Deprecated APIs: Transaction.add_user_attribute has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameter. Transaction.add_user_attribute will be removed in a future release. Transaction.add_user_attributes has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameters. Transaction.add_user_attributes will be removed in a future release. wrap_callable has been deprecated in favor of FunctionWrapper. wrap_callable will be removed in a future release. data-source admin command: The platform API (used by newrelic-admin data-source) has been removed. Please use data sources in place of the platform API. 2.104.0.86 Release notes: Python agent 2.104.0.86 SSL: Disabling SSL connections has been deprecated. SSL connections are enabled by default. In a future release, the option to disable SSL will be removed. 2.56.0.42 Release notes: Python agent 2.56.0.42 Deprecated config settings: Several configuration settings have been deprecated. The most commonly used of the deprecated settings are capture_params and ignored_params. To achieve the same functionality as the old settings, use the new attributes.include and attributes.exclude settings. 2.10.0.8 Release notes: Python agent 2.10.0.8 Deprecated API: Do not use the agent API function add_user_attribute(), which is now deprecated. Instead, use the add_custom_parameter() function. Optional: To display these parameters in browser traces, enable the browser_monitoring.capture_attributes agent configuration setting. At or below 2.0.0 Proxy settings: Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending on whether SSL is disabled or enabled. If you are updating from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the SSL setting for backwards compatibility. Proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme. If you do not set proxy_scheme, this may result in a failure. 1.11.0.55 Release notes: Python agent 1.11.0.55 Thread profiling for WSGI servers: We have disabled the ability to get thread profiling information when a WSGI server uses coroutine libraries such as gevent or eventlet. This is because, due to the nature of how coroutines are implemented, we are not able to generate accurate usable data. 1.0.3.138 Release notes: Python agent 1.0.3.138 Attributes from WSGI requests: Attributes captured from WSGI request environments such as REQUEST_METHOD, HTTP_REFERER, and HTTP_USER_AGENT now appear in the UI under the Request environment category in error details and slow transaction traces. Previously they appeared in the UI under Custom parameters.",

Verify your instrumentation The API has a number of built-in safety mechanisms to prevent issues caused by incorrect API usage, but you can use these techniques to verify that your application’s instrumentation is correct: After instrumenting your code, verify that the logs show that an equal number of tokens have been created and expired. For more information on which log messages to look for, see Use logs to troubleshoot. Check the garbage collection statistics under APM's JVMs page to determine whether or not your changes have significantly altered garbage collection patterns. Check if any segments or tokens are timing out by reviewing your transaction traces for a timed_out attribute. If so, you can change the limit with token_timeout and segment_timeout. Use logs to troubleshoot To customize your Java agent logging, see Generating logs. Then, you can examine your logs for these common messages: To view created tokens, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: created active token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view expired tokens and the time that they expired, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: expired token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view created segments, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04: startSegment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 created and started with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy To view ended segments and the time that they ended, check logs at FINEST for: com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04--finish segment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 async finish with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy Problem: Transaction times are too long Make sure to expire tokens and end or ignore segments; otherwise transactions may take longer to report to New Relic. The Java agent has a timeout mechanism for tokens and segments that are not ended correctly. For more information, see token_timeout and segment_timeout. Problem: No transaction trace data Inspect transaction traces to make sure expected asynchronous work is reported. If you do not see any transaction traces, make sure your transaction duration exceeds the transaction trace threshold set in transaction_threshold. Problem: Too few async calls If too few calls are being reported: Ensure that each activity you monitor is appropriately linked In the faulty example below, a parallel stream is being used, which means that the work done inside the lambda in the call to map() can be scheduled on a different thread than the thread handling the request. Without creating a token to link all this work together, you will not see any of the work that gets scheduled on a different thread inside of your transaction. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(i -> requestItem(i)) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad\", results); } Copy Check if you are missing required annotations The example below will report only a subset of the calls to requestItem() because it is impossible to put @Trace(async = true) around blocks of anonymous work inside the call to map(). Instead, you should pass the token into requestItem() and link it, and then add @Trace(async=true) around it. Or use a helper function like requestItemAsync() to do this without changing your existing methods. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad2\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad2(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> { token.link(); return requestItem(id); }) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad2\", results); } Copy Compare this to the correct example below, in which the lambda expression is wrapped by the wrapper class InstrumentedCallable.

This class accepts a token and a lambda, then wraps asynchronous work in @Trace(async = true) and uses a token to link the work to the request thread. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_wrap\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamWrap(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> InstrumentedCallable.instrumentCallable(token, () -> requestItem(id))) .map(c -> c.call()) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire(); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_wrap\", results); } Copy",

      "body": "The Python agent default security settings automatically provide security for your data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information we ingest. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

The following configuration will turn on parameter capture for the default destinations: transaction_tracer, transaction_events, and error_collector. To limit the destinations see the Selecting specific destinations example. Configuration: attributes.include = request.parameters.* Copy Capture only specific request parameters To capture only specific request parameters, you can simply pass a list to attributes.include: Configuration: attributes.include = request.parameters.user_id request.parameters.product_id Copy Disable all attributes In this example, attributes are disabled, so the include and exclude lists will be ignored and all attributes will be filtered out. Configuration: attributes.enabled = false attributes.include = request.parameters.* Copy Input keys: foo, bar, request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Output for destinations: transaction_tracer: none error_collector: none transaction_events: none browser_monitoring: none Copy Select specific destinations In this example: Attributes are disabled for transaction traces. The include and exclude lists will be ignored, and all attributes will be filtered out for this destination. Attributes are also disabled for browser monitoring by default. Request parameters (prefixed with request.parameters.) are off by default for all destinations. As a result, only bar is sent in traced errors and transaction events.

      "body": "The Python agent default security settings automatically provide security for your data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information we ingest. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

      "body": "To take full advantage of our latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Python agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Python agent release notes. Update with Python package index (PyPi) The Python agent package is listed on PyPi at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic. To update with a specific package, follow the corresponding instructions: Python package Installation procedures pip To update the newrelic package directly from PyPi, run: pip install --upgrade newrelic Copy If you have New Relic in your requirements.txt file, you can do a mass update of all required packages by running: pip install -r requirements.txt Copy easy_install To update using easy_install, run: easy_install --upgrade newrelic Copy Tip We recommend using pip rather than using easy_install, because pip will correctly remove old versions when updating the agent software. buildout Install the package by creating an appropriate section for the newrelic package using the zc.recipe.egg recipe. Download package manually To manually download the New Relic Python package: Remove the current New Relic package. Download the new package, then follow the Python agent installation procedures. Tip We recommend using pip rather than using manual installation, because pip will correctly remove old versions when updating the agent software. Python agent versions not supported End of life notification: As of January 26, 2015, we will no longer accept data from Python agent versions earlier than 2.42.0. These agent versions use an out-of-date protocol when communicating with our data collection services. In addition, many of these versions contain a potential security issue where they may incorrectly send sensitive data to our data collector. Update unsupported agent versions Important If you are updating from an older agent version, including major version jumps, review the following list for changes in functionality. Migration Comments 4.2.0.100 and higher Release notes: Python agent 4.2.0.100 Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Set with the Python agent config file. 4.0.0.99 Release notes: Python agent 4.0.0.99 Previously deprecated APIs removed: Transaction.add_user_attribute (use Transaction.add_custom_parameter) Transaction.add_user_attributes (use Transaction.add_custom_parameters) wrap_callable (use FunctionWrapper) Removed support for Python 2.6 and Python 3.3: Python 2.6 and Python 3.3 are no longer supported. Recommendation: Update your application to a supported version of Python in order to continue to receive updates to the Python agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3: These are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. 3.0.0.89 Release notes: Python agent 3.0.0.89 Previously deprecated APIs removed: transaction (use current_transaction) name_transaction (use set_transaction_name) Application.record_metric (use Application.record_custom_metric) Application.record_metrics (use Application.record_custom_metrics) Transaction.record_metric (use Transaction.record_custom_metric) Transaction.name_transaction (use Transaction.set_transaction_name) Deprecated APIs: Transaction.add_user_attribute has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameter. Transaction.add_user_attribute will be removed in a future release. Transaction.add_user_attributes has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameters. Transaction.add_user_attributes will be removed in a future release. wrap_callable has been deprecated in favor of FunctionWrapper. wrap_callable will be removed in a future release. data-source admin command: The platform API (used by newrelic-admin data-source) has been removed. Please use data sources in place of the platform API. 2.104.0.86 Release notes: Python agent 2.104.0.86 SSL: Disabling SSL connections has been deprecated. SSL connections are enabled by default. In a future release, the option to disable SSL will be removed. 2.56.0.42 Release notes: Python agent 2.56.0.42 Deprecated config settings: Several configuration settings have been deprecated. The most commonly used of the deprecated settings are capture_params and ignored_params. To achieve the same functionality as the old settings, use the new attributes.include and attributes.exclude settings. 2.10.0.8 Release notes: Python agent 2.10.0.8 Deprecated API: Do not use the agent API function add_user_attribute(), which is now deprecated. Instead, use the add_custom_parameter() function. Optional: To display these parameters in browser traces, enable the browser_monitoring.capture_attributes agent configuration setting. At or below 2.0.0 Proxy settings: Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending on whether SSL is disabled or enabled. If you are updating from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the SSL setting for backwards compatibility. Proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme. If you do not set proxy_scheme, this may result in a failure. 1.11.0.55 Release notes: Python agent 1.11.0.55 Thread profiling for WSGI servers: We have disabled the ability to get thread profiling information when a WSGI server uses coroutine libraries such as gevent or eventlet. This is because, due to the nature of how coroutines are implemented, we are not able to generate accurate usable data. 1.0.3.138 Release notes: Python agent 1.0.3.138 Attributes from WSGI requests: Attributes captured from WSGI request environments such as REQUEST_METHOD, HTTP_REFERER, and HTTP_USER_AGENT now appear in the UI under the Request environment category in error details and slow transaction traces. Previously they appeared in the UI under Custom parameters.",

      "body": "The Python agent default security settings automatically provide security for your data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information we ingest. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

To update with a specific package, follow the corresponding instructions: Python package Installation procedures pip To update the newrelic package directly from PyPi, run: pip install --upgrade newrelic Copy If you have New Relic in your requirements.txt file, you can do a mass update of all required packages by running: pip install -r requirements.txt Copy easy_install To update using easy_install, run: easy_install --upgrade newrelic Copy Tip We recommend using pip rather than using easy_install, because pip will correctly remove old versions when updating the agent software. buildout Install the package by creating an appropriate section for the newrelic package using the zc.recipe.egg recipe. Download package manually To manually download the New Relic Python package: Remove the current New Relic package. Download the new package, then follow the Python agent installation procedures. Tip We recommend using pip rather than using manual installation, because pip will correctly remove old versions when updating the agent software. Python agent versions not supported End of life notification: As of January 26, 2015, we will no longer accept data from Python agent versions earlier than 2.42.0. These agent versions use an out-of-date protocol when communicating with our data collection services. In addition, many of these versions contain a potential security issue where they may incorrectly send sensitive data to our data collector. Update unsupported agent versions Important If you are updating from an older agent version, including major version jumps, review the following list for changes in functionality. Migration Comments 4.2.0.100 and higher Release notes: Python agent 4.2.0.100 Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Set with the Python agent config file. 4.0.0.99 Release notes: Python agent 4.0.0.99 Previously deprecated APIs removed: Transaction.add_user_attribute (use Transaction.add_custom_parameter) Transaction.add_user_attributes (use Transaction.add_custom_parameters) wrap_callable (use FunctionWrapper) Removed support for Python 2.6 and Python 3.3: Python 2.6 and Python 3.3 are no longer supported. Recommendation: Update your application to a supported version of Python in order to continue to receive updates to the Python agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3: These are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. 3.0.0.89 Release notes: Python agent 3.0.0.89 Previously deprecated APIs removed: transaction (use current_transaction) name_transaction (use set_transaction_name) Application.record_metric (use Application.record_custom_metric) Application.record_metrics (use Application.record_custom_metrics) Transaction.record_metric (use Transaction.record_custom_metric) Transaction.name_transaction (use Transaction.set_transaction_name) Deprecated APIs: Transaction.add_user_attribute has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameter. Transaction.add_user_attribute will be removed in a future release. Transaction.add_user_attributes has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameters. Transaction.add_user_attributes will be removed in a future release. wrap_callable has been deprecated in favor of FunctionWrapper. wrap_callable will be removed in a future release. data-source admin command: The platform API (used by newrelic-admin data-source) has been removed. Please use data sources in place of the platform API. 2.104.0.86 Release notes: Python agent 2.104.0.86 SSL: Disabling SSL connections has been deprecated. SSL connections are enabled by default. In a future release, the option to disable SSL will be removed. 2.56.0.42 Release notes: Python agent 2.56.0.42 Deprecated config settings: Several configuration settings have been deprecated. The most commonly used of the deprecated settings are capture_params and ignored_params. To achieve the same functionality as the old settings, use the new attributes.include and attributes.exclude settings. 2.10.0.8 Release notes: Python agent 2.10.0.8 Deprecated API: Do not use the agent API function add_user_attribute(), which is now deprecated. Instead, use the add_custom_parameter() function. Optional: To display these parameters in browser traces, enable the browser_monitoring.capture_attributes agent configuration setting. At or below 2.0.0 Proxy settings: Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending on whether SSL is disabled or enabled. If you are updating from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the SSL setting for backwards compatibility. Proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme. If you do not set proxy_scheme, this may result in a failure. 1.11.0.55 Release notes: Python agent 1.11.0.55 Thread profiling for WSGI servers: We have disabled the ability to get thread profiling information when a WSGI server uses coroutine libraries such as gevent or eventlet. This is because, due to the nature of how coroutines are implemented, we are not able to generate accurate usable data. 1.0.3.138 Release notes: Python agent 1.0.3.138 Attributes from WSGI requests: Attributes captured from WSGI request environments such as REQUEST_METHOD, HTTP_REFERER, and HTTP_USER_AGENT now appear in the UI under the Request environment category in error details and slow transaction traces.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Python versions 2.6 and 3.3: These are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. 3.0.0.89 Release notes: Python agent 3.0.0.89 Previously deprecated APIs removed: transaction (use current_transaction) name_transaction (use set_transaction_name) Application.record_metric (use Application.record_custom_metric) Application.record_metrics (use Application.record_custom_metrics) Transaction.record_metric (use Transaction.record_custom_metric) Transaction.name_transaction (use Transaction.set_transaction_name) Deprecated APIs: Transaction.add_user_attribute has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameter. Transaction.add_user_attribute will be removed in a future release. Transaction.add_user_attributes has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameters. Transaction.add_user_attributes will be removed in a future release. wrap_callable has been deprecated in favor of FunctionWrapper. wrap_callable will be removed in a future release. data-source admin command: The platform API (used by newrelic-admin data-source) has been removed. Please use data sources in place of the platform API. 2.104.0.86 Release notes: Python agent 2.104.0.86 SSL: Disabling SSL connections has been deprecated. SSL connections are enabled by default. In a future release, the option to disable SSL will be removed. 2.56.0.42 Release notes: Python agent 2.56.0.42 Deprecated config settings: Several configuration settings have been deprecated. The most commonly used of the deprecated settings are capture_params and ignored_params. To achieve the same functionality as the old settings, use the new attributes.include and attributes.exclude settings. 2.10.0.8 Release notes: Python agent 2.10.0.8 Deprecated API: Do not use the agent API function add_user_attribute(), which is now deprecated. Instead, use the add_custom_parameter() function. Optional: To display these parameters in browser traces, enable the browser_monitoring.capture_attributes agent configuration setting. At or below 2.0.0 Proxy settings: Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending on whether SSL is disabled or enabled. If you are updating from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the SSL setting for backwards compatibility. Proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme. If you do not set proxy_scheme, this may result in a failure. 1.11.0.55 Release notes: Python agent 1.11.0.55 Thread profiling for WSGI servers: We have disabled the ability to get thread profiling information when a WSGI server uses coroutine libraries such as gevent or eventlet. This is because, due to the nature of how coroutines are implemented, we are not able to generate accurate usable data. 1.0.3.138 Release notes: Python agent 1.0.3.138 Attributes from WSGI requests: Attributes captured from WSGI request environments such as REQUEST_METHOD, HTTP_REFERER, and HTTP_USER_AGENT now appear in the UI under the Request environment category in error details and slow transaction traces. Previously they appeared in the UI under Custom parameters.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

For more information, see Instrumentation via API. In either case, these mechanisms only target the designated function call. It is not recursive, nor does it enable full profiling below the annotated function. Additional considerations You must individually annotate each function call you want to trace. If you are not sure which function you should annotate, you can use thread profiling features to narrow it down. Caution Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of both your application and the agent. To avoid potential data problems, try to keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000.",

      "body": "New Relic's default APM agent settings provide a high level of security. However, you may need to guarantee that even if the default APM agent settings are overridden to be more permissive, no sensitive data will ever be sent to New Relic. If this is the case, then you will want to turn on APM's high security mode (also known as enterprise security mode). For more information about our security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Requirements Customers on our New Relic One pricing plan require Enterprise edition. Customers on our original pricing plan have access depending on their subscription level. Account level If you choose to turn on high security, you must enable high security for all applications reporting to the account. High security must be set on each individual account. For organizations that have a parent/child account structure, child accounts don't automatically inherit the high security setting when enabled on the parent account. Currently there are two versions of high security mode. Version 1 is deprecated and is only available if you already have it. If you are enabling high security mode for the first time, the only option is version 2 (v2). Agent Version 2 support C SDK n/a Go All versions Java 3.7 or higher (enabled by default) .NET 3.3 or higher Node.js 1.7.0 or higher PHP 4.9 or higher Python 2.22.0.0 or higher Ruby 3.9.1 or higher Enable high security mode (version 2) To enable high security, you must update both the local configuration on your server and the remote configuration in the UI. Caution Once you enable high security for an account, high security cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. Setting location Description Set in UI To set high security in the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown and select Account settings. On that page, select High security mode. If you are on our original pricing plan, only the account owner can view this option. If the agent is configured for high security via the UI but not locally, then the agent connections will be rejected, and the agent will shut down. However, this won't shut down your application. Local, via agent Enable high security mode in your agent configuration file. High security mode is disabled by default, and the exact procedure to enable it varies by agent: C SDK: n/a Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby If the agent is configured for high security locally but not via the UI, then the agent connections will be rejected, and the agent will shut down. This will not shut down your application. Results of enabling high security mode (version 2) Once enabled, high security mode (v2) ensures the following for your account: Feature Comments Requires agents to use a secure connection (HTTPS) High security mode requires a secure (HTTPS) connection. Non-secure connection attempts will be rejected. The latest version of all New Relic agents support HTTPS. If the configuration is not set appropriately, the agent will override the property to ensure all data in transit per the latest industry standards. Prevents HTTP param capture High security mode does not allow HTTP params, which may contain sensitive customer data, to be sent to the New Relic collector. If the agent is configured to send HTTP params locally or through server-side configuration, high security mode will override the configuration to never capture HTTP params. Prevents message queue param capture High security mode does not allow message queue params, which may contain sensitive customer data, to be sent to the New Relic collector. If the agent is configured to send message queue params locally or through server-side configuration, then high security mode will override the configuration to never capture message queue params. Prevents raw query statement capture High security mode does not allow raw database query statements, which may contain sensitive customer data, to be captured. If the agent is configured to capture raw queries locally or through server-side configuration, then high security mode will override the configuration to never capture raw queries. Prevents user attribute capture High security mode does not allow attributes set using each agent's API to be captured, as these may contain sensitive customer data. For example, in the Java agent, attributes passed in through the following NewRelic agent API calls will be blocked: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(String key, String value) Copy NewRelic.addCustomParameter(String key, Number value) Copy NewRelic.setUserName(String name) Copy NewRelic.setAccountName(String name) Copy NewRelic.setProductName(String name) Copy Prevents noticeError attribute capture High security mode does not allow attributes set using each agent's noticeError API call to be captured as these may contain sensitive customer data. For example, in the Java agent, attributes passed in through the following NewRelic agent API calls will be blocked: NewRelic.noticeError(String message, Map<String, String> params) Copy NewRelic.noticeError(Throwable throwable, Map<String, String> params) Copy Prevents custom events High security mode does not allow custom events to be created using the agent API, as these may contain sensitive customer data. For example, in the .NET agent, the API call RecordCustomEvent will be blocked. Prevents deploying Custom Instrumentation via CIE High security mode does not allow deploying custom instrumentation when using the Custom Instrumentation Editor. If you have high security mode enabled, you must export the instrumentation and manually import it to your app server. Results of enabling high security mode v1 (deprecated) High security mode version 1 is deprecated and only available if you enabled it prior to version 2 being available. High security mode version 1 ensures the following for your account: Feature Comments Requires agents to use a secure connection (HTTPS) High security mode requires an encrypted connection (HTTPS). Non-secure connection attempts will be rejected. The latest version of all New Relic agents support HTTPS. If the configuration is not set appropriately, the agent will override the property to ensure that all data in transit is encrypted as per the latest industry standards. Prevents HTTP param capture Agents configured to capture HTTP params, which may contain sensitive customer data, are not allowed to connect to New Relic. If the local configuration is set to capture request parameters, then New Relic's collector will reject the connection, and the agent will shut down. Prevents raw query statement capture Agents configured to capture raw database query statements, which may contain sensitive customer data, are not allowed to connect to New Relic. If the agent is configured to capture raw queries locally or through server-side configuration, New Relic's collector will reject the connection and the agent will shut down. Prevents deploying Custom Instrumentation via CIE High security mode does not allow deploying custom instrumentation when using the Custom Instrumentation Editor. If you have high security mode enabled, you must export the instrumentation and manually import it to your app server. Migrate from version 1 to version 2 These are the main differences between the two versions of high security: In order to make high security even more secure, high security must be enabled in the New Relic user interface and in the local New Relic configuration file. High security v1 only required high security to be set in the New Relic UI. User attributes, noticeError attributes, and message queue parameters are turned off with high security in version 2, but not in version 1. To update from v1 to v2, add high_security: true to your local agent configuration file.",
